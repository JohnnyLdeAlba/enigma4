<p>Yabb or Yet another bulletin board is a forum system written in Perl. 
One of the reasons we stopped using it was because of our hosts bias on data management through files. 
To this day Yabb still uses a file based management and is one of the most popular forum systems today. 
If our host did not make this decision long ago we would have still been using it and even enhanced it.</p>

<p>Since then we were forced to use PhpBB which is a complete nightmare in data storage. 
The tables are split in three parts one with the topics and post the other with user data and 
a third for the actual messages. The problem with this is this requires three look ups just to 
retrieve the data. If anyone were to recover this data they would need the version last used of phpBB 
and if that version is not adoptable with your server the software itself won't run.</p>

<p>Because of PhpBB and Postnukes complex systems we would of not used a million different forum 
systems and everything would of been okay. Unfortunately this was not the case and the site suffered 
alot of its true potential because of it. Thank god everything today operates from Enigma and on a 
private server!</p>
