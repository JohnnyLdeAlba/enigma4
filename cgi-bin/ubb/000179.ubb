The only cause of such a problem I know of is if you have turned off automatic playing of sounds in your browser setting.  Try checking if that is turned on or not but I think it is since you said you could hear the music on expage websites in your email.  The only other thing I could suggest is that you try clicking on the increase volume button to ensure that your computer isn't just playing the music too quietly to hear.
