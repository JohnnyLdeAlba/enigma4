Z||000000||Histronic||12-02-2000||09:19 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||I'm surprised no one posted this already.  But what do you want Ecco 2 to be like?<p>Plot: I've heard some stuff about Mutaclone, but I don't believe it.  I think it will have something to do with the Foes getting really biffed at Ecco, and instead of altering the future, they just pull out the latest in destruction technology and battle Earth.<p>I think there should be a part where Ecco goes to the Foe planet, or at least on their spaceship.  I was so disappointed there were no spaceship scenes in DOTF.  Maybe Ecco could even drive one!
Z||000001||Trace Kyshad||12-02-2000||10:57 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Hmm, cool ideas. Me and my bro made up an analysis of the Foe, and came up with...<p><i>The 'Foe' are creatures without name, because they are remenents of thousands of other creatures. As seen in the final levels, creatures resembling sharks, snakes, and other familiar life forms are present, which leads to the following hypothesis...<p>The Foe are similar to that of StarCrafts 'Zerg' and WH 40K's 'Tyrannid'. They adapt other creatures into their own culture. By interfiering with their evolution, they can add creatures to there own kind. <p>In the forth Timeline, the Foe easily conquered Earth, but for how long? This raises the question of how the Foe came to be. "Flying Dinosaur type creature in Cutscene" could lead to the Foe being quick at the job, travelling to the past easily to add to their own, or maybe just another planet, who knows.</i><p>Which now asks. What became of Humans? When the Foe descended upon Earth and Ecco was all on his tod against the Queen. Humans were either killed (Most likely) or added to the Foe's Forces.<p>So, as seem, water is a key part of the foe. For creatures like Sharks that depend on water, and such evolutional changes cannot be made. Then the spaceships would probably ocntain some sort of Container. Plus navigational controls, seen more complex than the 'Powers of Levitation' fiasco.<p>If the foe did return, what would be cool is if they in fact, detsroyed the Vortex. Think about it. The vortex were dying out from hunger, the queen messed up history slightly. Imagine the Foe v the Vortex! Pretty cool fight, Ecco could take part maybe, but on what side? The Vortex contained much tech, maybe not Spaceships as seen in the game, but certainly had the ability to Time Travel too (A possible ability from the Foe's takeover, they gained this from the Vortex... Hmm)<p>In 'Dolphins Nightmare', the Dolphins clearly showed an advance in Technoledgy. Mutaclone clearly had made quite a little challenge with his 'Hanging Waters'. What became of the Foe at this point of the game? Surly they would try to take over this tech... Or maybe even the 'Human Superweapon'... Maybe that's all explained in the game... Missed it.<p>THe thing is, the Foe lost a Queen, but in a seperate TImeline. As Ecco restored the timeline, the Foe Queen was never killed, the Foe never landed on Earth, and so they are still at large.<p>I still think the Foe v the Vortex would be sweet, you never know. In the original games, there was only one Vortex Queen, what if this was a Queen from a dying clan of the Vortex. The real Vortex Hive would be Immense, and span worlds. As the Vortex and Foe continue their fight for domination. The Vortex lose a queen on Planet Earth, and decide to stay away for now. The Foe, years later, attack Earth, as the War approaches Earth's Solar System. (The original V Queen was a scout of some kind, set on exploration. Runs low on food, sees Earth, takes the oppertunity. Loses it. Crashes to Earth. Tries again. Gives birth.)<p>If there was another Vortex Queen, then that leaves the Vortex still fine. If say, the QUeen from the end of ToT found Atlantis, and used the Machine again to seek revenge, then hey! New plot idea! Enter the classic villian. Soooo many opertunities.<p><br>Personally, I'd like to see the Vortex again, and the Foe. A Battle for planet Earth, while Ecco tries to keep both at bay. And also, the Asterite returns. I wanna see him in 3D!<p>

However, I wanna see the Asterite in a game for the DC, and I think it would have been awesome if they put those flying dolphins from the Tides of Time (I LOVE those dolphins!) in 3D...

But I will buy DotF tomorrow and get the Dreamcast at Christmas. Christmas holidays will be great this year I guess <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">

Z||000007||Histronic||12-03-2000||04:28 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Good ideas, Trace.  Except, DOTF is actually just a rewrite of the original Ecco, so Appaloosa is trying to say that the original 2 never existed.  So the Vortex and Asterite are no more, unless they bring the old plot back....  As for the spaceship, there would be a container, or the whole thing would be full of water like the <I>Streaker</I> in <U>Startide Rising</U>.<br>As for the Dolphins' Nightmare timeline, I think the Foe were not attacking because the dolphins were not threatening to them.  In the beginning of the game, it explains that the Foe only attacked because they felt threatened.  In Mans' Nightmare, the Foe were threatend because of human weapons, with no wise dolphins to tell them not to use them.  The Foe never attacked Earth in Dolphins' Nightmare because Mutaclone was too busy genociding other dolphins and making swastika stamping machines to take notice of space, I guess.
Z||000008||dragonboy||12-03-2000||04:54 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||you know how it mentions in the begining of dotf that dolphin and humans went exploring into space together. well it would be cool, if a new threat was found and ecco had to go into space to the region where the explorers were being attacked and help out.  it would be cool too if ecco morphed into a human for onr stage so he could walk and fight on land.  these are just a couple of my ideas
Z||000009||Trace Kyshad||12-03-2000||06:14 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Hmm, I'm not sure that Ecco DoF is a 'rewrite'. At the end of Ecco ToT, he is said to become lost in the Tides of Time...<p>In DoF, you are told Dolphins and Humans have shared existance for 500 years (Since that moment of Sencience (sp) in which the Doe disrupted). Which leads me to think that Ecco, at the beginning of the game, is the ecco from 500+ years earlier, just dropping in from the Tides of Time.<p>Although that's just my little theory, to link the two universes together
Z||000010||Ecco The Dolphin||12-05-2000||10:13 PM||eccodolphin@hotmail.com||The first Ecco games are unrelated in story to DoF in any way, Trace.  By the time the company it was run by mostly all different people, inluding the head leaders.  They decided to make the new game  mostly because Ecco had been a respectable game on the Genesis and it had a good license.  They were simply trying to cash in on work done in the past.  They didn't care about the old storyline though and so decided to make up an entirely new one.  I'm not even sure if the designers of DoF knew the original storyline.
