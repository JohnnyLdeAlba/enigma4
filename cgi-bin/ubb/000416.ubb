Z||000001||Pharphignewton||11-23-2000||08:15 PM||mailbox@aol.com||I can turn on the machine and start the rocks moving, but after that, I'm lost.<IMG SRC="confused.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="confused">
Z||000002||dragonboy||11-23-2000||08:30 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||yeah, i spent a half an hour wondering what the heck to do.  i slapped myself against the head when i realized what i was not noticing.  before each grinding wheel there is a room off to the left that controls the height of particular grinders.  but there is a pattern you must follow, and i'lll leave that up to your puzzle-solving skills.

Z||000005||Pharphignewton||11-24-2000||06:35 PM||mailbox@aol.com||Yes, I saw that, but if I look at a walkthrough it will ruin the suprises in the storyline.<IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">  This way I won't be tempted to look ahead in the game.

Z||000007||dragonboy||11-27-2000||12:51 AM||returner8@hotmail.com||good spirited attitude, man.  walkthroughs and startegy guides are a last resort-before-shooting-your-head-off thing!  I also buy strategy guuides after beating games to help find everything out about a game, like special weapons, side quests etc
