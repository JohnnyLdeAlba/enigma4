Visit the New News section of <A HREF="http://histronic.tripod.com/" TARGET=_blank>SonCo Boulevard</A>  Hey, well, after you read that, come back here and tell me what you think.

Oh well, it follows as this:<br>It is a sort of Dolphin Soccer game, with unlockable characters, many, many different arenas with their own obstacles and such, among other things.
