Z||000000||Arkonviox||06-13-2001||10:52 PM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com||Well wel well...i just noticed we have at of new people here...i could say that pisses me off since my freakin site hasnt picked up a true newbie in months...and once again im aced with being the person who has to stand outside the crowd and watch like a little kid all the other kids play while i am forced to sit and do chores and  **** ...this was how it was like last time i was forced to be gone from everything and i get so sick of it...then i have smart asses i dont know in my return tell me that this is there turf and that i need to get off it...puh people always seem to forget who the hel i am...I"M ARKONVIOX DAMMIT!...and if you havent learned yet to who i am then  i dont think you know who your dealting with...right now im striving on returning...i already learned how to program in perl used for making forums meaning i now have the skill to make enigma which is the engine which powers my website go to a whole new level...but if my website isnt gonna pull in people right maybe i need a break and should start a website that has a potential of picking up thousands of visitros in one day...thats right im rely tempted on starting another website a dragonballz one so if we got any dbz fans out there who would like to contribute to "MR. PRAWN" ha ha then help me cme up with a name...a list of names would be like dbzonline.com or something like planet namik.com a dotcom name to go with my idea....anyways thats part of my plan along with expanding arkonviox.com i just wanted to try something new to expand my empire wider and finding people to help maintain my new website should be a very easy goal..som say hey wok on your current site but if im not having any luck i might as well go into the mainstream and use that to my advantage to expand the "arkonviox empire"<p>anyways if you got ideas laythem out cause this should be fun...very fun indeed!<p>~Arkonviox

Some of us don't like it just as much as you do! I'm just glad you were able to come for a bit and make a few posts on forums...it's always nice to know yer still around... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"> ! I hope you get that computer of yours finished real soon, and I'm sure any new improvements to your existing site will be incredible, as they always are!<p>As far as helping you with ideas for a new site you may want to establish, I really wish I could help. But I'm not a fan of DBZ only because I've never really seen it. I'm sure though it'd be a site that could really get going! If you do end up creating another masterpiece web site, I hope you will still continue to keep the Arkonviox.com one open, as it's a wonderful site and shouldn't be closed! I'm not the only one of that mindset either.<p>Anyway, good luck and god speed on your return! I hope to <i>talk</i> to you soon... <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ...and take care, tough guy! 
Z||000002||BlackDragon||06-14-2001||07:08 AM||blackfox71@yahoo.com||I'm sorry that you feel that way Arkon'. Just for the record, I DO visit your site often. Especially the art sections. Your the one who e-mailed me the link for crying out loud! Don't be upset, your not alone. Many people frequent sites without letting on to their presence. I know that I do it sometimes...  <IMG SRC="smilie8.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="sick"> <p>One more thing before I have to head off to work...I like DBZ. Trunks and Vegeta being my favorite characters. Considering how cool your Ecco site is, I can't wait for you to get your dragonball z one up and running. Are you planning on having a fan art section for that site too? Maybe I can draw a few things to contribute, ya think?  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> 
Z||000003||blackfin||06-14-2001||08:26 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Arkon please don't get angry, if you are looking to build a website to get attention you are building on a very wrong game, I started with nobody on this website and it took me six months just to get a few people and a year to get a decend fan base I don't really see many more people than this turning up, ecco simply isn't a mainstream game.  But to get as many people as possible I'd actually advise to drop thinking about getting visitors and concentrate on making your website as good as possible, a DBZ website would be kewl but having many websites can make it hard to give them all their due attentention.  And like BD said, many people visit without making an appearance but the one thing I can't say enough... UPDATE!  nothing sends people away faster than seeing a website that hasn't been updated for ages, thats why I make the effort to update daily even if it means I'm up to 1am every day.
Z||000004||vantid||06-14-2001||01:08 PM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Poor arkon...i know what you mean. Your site is dying as of right now. The forum is devoid of any new posts...updates are few and far between...maybe....SWEET! Arkon i just found out there is a scanner i can use here in the library. You and crestoe watch yo email cuz im sendin you a hell of a lotta stuff. I hiope you like that. See, thats the only way i can contribute to your site. And yeah, DBZ wold be an awesome expansion of your empire...my faves are trunks(what a hottie <IMG SRC="smilie7.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="makeface"> ) and picolo(dat how you spell it?)Also you need more stuff up about your kick@s$ story. And mo crestoe work oh yeah. Your site is awesome arkon....dont be discouraged. You already have over 10000 hits and youve only been open for a few months. Just remember that i go there...a lot...and i miss you! <IMG SRC="smoking.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=21 BORDER=0 ALT="smoking">  
Z||000005||BlackDragon||06-14-2001||07:51 PM||blackfox71@yahoo.com||  <IMG SRC="smilie40.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH=19 BORDER=0 ALT="book">  Blackfin is right Arkon', updating is a VERY important part to having a website. I have TWO websites and I try to update twice a week if I can. Once a week if I have to, it really does help keep people interested and comming back. <p>(Of course, what your site is about helps on how often you update. Art oriented sites like mine can be updated often, as long as the artist is someone who draws or paints all the time, and keeps an eye on their site.(like me) <IMG SRC="smilie44.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rolling"> )
Z||000006||Crestoe||06-14-2001||09:02 PM||crestoe@arkonviox.com||Ahhhh....tats is, ecc just pisses me off!<br>Aihyo, Arkon! Les ditcht his and do the DBZ yo will be Mr.PRAWN and  be Brolli.<br>Bieng in a place where you have friends who ae going  tal sum s<a>hit behind your back for as har as we work, phonny as<a>s friends, and ppl wo are close to you who are a bunch of sissys.<p>One second they have your back the ex minte they're fukkin you over. Oh well...<p>well Arkon, lets pack up and go, me and you know w mother fukkin cowards roll, tinks is time we ditched them, <br>
Z||000007||dolphingirl||06-14-2001||10:39 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||First off, I don't know why you all went on about this tangent of updating your website. Arkon and Crestoe are very good at doing that...so what's the deal?! Anyway, I think they both do a good enough job on running their website as it is.<p>Second of all...Crestoe...either you're typing on a hellish keyboard, or you're so frickin mad you can't type straight. I'm sorry you got mad at what these people said...but I hope any of what I said didn't contribute. Please don't go away...leave yer stuff right where it is and stay! Why be hastey and pick up and take off...?!? <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> 
Z||000008||yogoat||06-14-2001||10:49 PM||||In what way were we talking behind your back?  Has there been a Deep Throat around here or something spreading false information?
Z||000009||GTK||06-15-2001||01:36 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Arkon, if you want to be a leader in the field I wouldn't pick Dragonball Z as your website subject. There are so many great resources out there nobody'll notice you at all for a good long while unless you set out to put everything in existence on your site and e-mail every other webmaster you can find. TRUST ME. <p>Actually, I go with what blackfin said about building up your site. You should definitely stick with arkonviox.com for now as it's an achievement you already have. As for getting newbies... *shrugs* I ran the biggest online fanfiction archive for a good long while... until FanFiction.Net eclipsed me with their university webspace and dedicated servers >=( I'm still sore but what can I do? What I did find when I was running Arcana was that newbies came more or less independently of whatever you did. To give an example, one girl found my site when looking for NiGHTS fan artwork and subsequently brought all her (ten plus) friends to role-play on the messageboard. <p>I hope you don't decide to floor me for this, but personally I was always put off your site because of all the Internet Explorer gewgaws. I only ever use Netscape Navigator (it's a matter of personal preference) so whenever I want to view your site I have to open up the other browser. It's a minor matter. I could complain just as loudly about blackfin's epileptic fishies that appear in IE: they always crash it. <p>As for getting newbies... *shrugs again* I dunno. Be nice to them? =\ 
Z||000010||blackfin||06-15-2001||08:00 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||GTK it sounds like you have a buggy version of IE, installing the latest patch will fix the horrible flashing I think, or else you can turn the fish off on the 'customise' page.<p>Crestoe I am really lost as to what you are talking about?  Arkon asked why he wasn't getting visitors to his website so I'm answered his question, even though you generally undate good lately it has been quite a while between updates (I know you are working on stuff in the background but waiting for it is boring...), that is why interest is laging, an update would bring more people back....  I'm sorry if I've said anything to upset you....<br>
Z||000011||Arkonviox||06-15-2001||11:31 PM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com||one thing you people forget i have been working my *** off everyday for fucking arkonviox.com i think doing something new will benefit me especialy since both me and crestoe will be having owr own computers and internet!
Z||000012||dolphingirl||06-16-2001||05:37 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||<i>*chimes in quietly*</i><p>I haven't...forgotten... <IMG SRC="smilie16.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="demented"> 
Z||000013||blackfin||06-16-2001||08:31 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||We haven't forgotten Arkon and um you ASKED why you weren't getting visitors.... so dont' blaim us if you don't like what you asked for, I know you work hard but if it's all work that doesn't get seen for ages it tends to get kind of boring waiting to see it......  I'm not trying to critise, just making a point....  A suggestion, break your updates up so we see new things often rather then one big thing every now and again, that way people won't get bored and stop visiting...<p>Oh and about all this complaining about 'critism' well that is a fact of being a webmaster, you WILL get flammed when you do you best even, and what happened here was just friendlly advice (compared to some emails I've got it looks downright friendly), if you can't hack a little critism I doubt you can make a big dbz website, the big fan comunityies are even less forgiving, the first big problem and you will lose everything and have to start from scratch again....  The fans are very vicious, I knew a webmaster who couldn't hack it (he took things like you do) and took everything personally, he is gone now and the people who could take it are still about....  So to be blunt Arkon you ar your own worst enemy.....  you need to stop taking everything so personally if you are going to be big....  <p>I hope that wasn't too insulting but that is what I've seen, I'm trying to give advice to a friend on how you can improove things not critise or flame... ok?
