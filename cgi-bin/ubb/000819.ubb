Ecco is dead, ecco is almost no more...<p>My site is entitled the ecco website that ends all ecco websites but who would have known by fighting i would end myself as to almost ending this place now me and blackfins sites are at the same level a level where people arent in the chatrooms no more and the forums people get lost in the topics that were made many days ago without a new topic...what is left?<p>Should we give up? I know i cant i know blackfin cant...but ecco is dead why should we trie to bring him back...sad to say i havent given up and i will put my all into building a community with lots and lots of people...<p>The fighting caused us all to lose, were nothing now so how will we dig owr way back to something? im very seroius both websites are totally lacking especially mine the most...I dont know what to say alot of my true friends have lost me as well as i lost them i want to give up but that desire in my wont allow it but i want to give up but i cant?!?!<p>Why do we trie to run a site based on a game that died many years ago? i dont know what to think i dont know how to revive the topic cause of my frustration, I eneded all ecco websites were all dead and we must pull owrselves together and come back!

(Well, I was an old fan but I didn't know of an Ecco community online). <p>I think the major problem with Ecco is that there's no publicity. And the official only-half-completed site sucks -_-; How about this for a suggestion? All of you who have written Ecco fanfiction, go to FanFiction.Net and e-mail to request an Ecco category. They've got categories for Minesweeper, they cannot deny us! Then, basically, the more active we can make that fanfiction category, the more people may check it out... and FF.N members can also post URLs (I've got a link up to Tidesinger, though since there's no Ecco category it had to go in Miscellaneous RPGs, which is why nobody's visited it *lol*). <p>Seriously, though, fandoms do die. I mean, there's little or no NiGHTS fandom left nowadays, 'sides from what Catilina, Yumeko and myself do for fanfiction. I think NiGHTS died because there was no new game; the Arcana messageboard used to buzz regularly every couple of months with the latest rumors about NiGHTS 2, but they were all false ones. Ecco, however, is going to have a new game! That will bring new fans to Ecco shores as well as reawkening the old ones, so I can't envisage Ecco fandom dying off completely just yet. <p>While we're still here, and while the Undercaves and Arkonviox messageboards are active, Ecco fandom is still alive. In my personal opinion, what we need is more fanworks to draw attention (which is one reason I started Tidesinger) but even without it I think we'll manage to keep our heads above water for a few months yet ^_^ NiGHTS fandom hung on for four YEARS without a new game being released, because we were all making fanworks all over the place. So get off your butts and start writing, people ^_^

"Vortex menace", "The new nightmare", "The Earth Clan Saga"<p>The story is laid out about ecco having to save the future from the Vortex king and the great dark whale apacalypes. Then earth clan where a dolphin from a parrelle world follows ecco back of the name sitna with a goal to become perfection!<p>Trustme this will be the ecco fict to end all ecco ficts but my website isnt complete with enough ecco info and until my goal is achieved i wont be ready to add my fict just yet but in time i will!<p>

Z||000008||blackfin||05-25-2001||08:36 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I don't think ecco is dead and it will never be as long as there are fans and I for one don't ever intend stopping, I started this website and built it alone at the begining, I will keep going and do the best I can no matter what, even if I'm alone again. What we really need is for me and Arkon to get onto your games, once we have a big fan project to draw everybody into things will get a lot better.<p>Megz welcome back, I've unbanned anybody<br>so yes you can post again, you can register if you want but the number of posts you have made is for the name that they were posted under, they can't be transfered, sorry.<br>

Z||000011||dragonboy||05-25-2001||08:16 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i love ecco dearly.  and i adore dolphins with all my heart.  if it wasn't for ecco and being able to take control of this awesome delphinic game character, my life defintely would have been less enjoyable.  i don;'t care how old i get or how many game systems i must buy, i will always be true to ecco.  and as for cetaceans, i don't need to tell you that i love them with every ou8nce of my being.

It means no matter how many obsticles there are in your way, how ever many times you fail, to always get back up and fight again. You must remember that ecco is not dead, as long as there are us. We had a little tiff netween the sites. So what! All that makes us in the end is stronger. It shows us that even after all that we still managed to stay together. We just need to amke sure this never happens again, ok. The ecco comunity is too small to be broken apart.
