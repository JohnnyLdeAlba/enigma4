Z||000000||Histronic||12-16-2000||12:56 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||I was looking at Blackfin's ecco 2 site, and I noticed a little something....  He has Atlantis Pictures!!!  I was sure I went through everything in that BETA, through every damned level....  I THOUGHT MY ECCO 2 BETA COVERAGE WAS COMPLETE!!!!!  Boy, am I pissed off.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!<p>Oh, and by the way, watch the ROM in DGEN, and you can read the beginning text screen.

I also read the text in the beginning, but i used genecyst, took screenshots and then edited the color paletter to make the letters visible...<p>But anyway, there is nothing different in the Beta text, so it isn't important...

Just for you to know <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
Z||000012||blackfin||12-17-2000||05:57 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||ok, that bug has been fixed.  The page was linked on the dhtml menu which is what I alway use to navigate the site so I never noticed that missing link.. sorry
