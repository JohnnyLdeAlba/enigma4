My friends, it was so dificult because when I accidentaly touched one of them and had to restart from begining. But now I have access to a different, wonderful and magnificent thing: a new archive in my VMU!! AAAAAHHHH!! All this work and nothing?<br>At least my heart´s in peace now.<br>By the way, are you going to buy any DC games this november??? oh! if I had U$ 500,00. I´m planning to get:<br>Skies of Arcadia, Shen Mue, heroes of might and magic and Tomb Raider Chronicles.

Just as dragonboy stated, you certainly finished with a challenge of some sort! But coming from someone who has collected all the vitalits (yeah, I'm proud of it-took a long time), you should try getting them all....now that is a challenge! Congrats anyway!!! <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup">
