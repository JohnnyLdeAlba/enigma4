Z||000000||Trace Kyshad||11-16-2000||04:01 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://redfireknux.homestead.com/files/jarjar/asterite.jpg"> <p>Now, about this pic.<p>It started as a mess around with that Glyph 3D Object I made, and then I added a bundle of spheres in the background for the Asterite. After that, Photoshop and it's many filters were released onto it. A fusion of layers, lens flares, glowing, alternative colouring, the strange green glow effect around the glyph which I'm still not sure how I achieved it, and the over layered sparkle (Look below the glyph) which I made previously.<p>Then, I decided to tone down some of the effects (Trust me, it was pretty darn colourful and freaky before, if you think it's a little OTT just now). Then, the Dolphins and Shark were rendered, and pasted upon the BG, various editing was made to shift the shark into the distance and give him a red glow. Lighting effects were touched up a little, and a motion blur was used by the glow of the glyph onto the Dolphins just for effect.<p>Finally, the 'Ecco The Dolphin' text was added in the corner, and it was done. All thanks to Photoshop...<p>Anyone think I should enter this for the Art Compo?
