Let me explain.<p>OK, I'm not as cool as Arkonviox, I know that. That is why Arkonviox is better liked here as me, so of course that's another reason of you for me to leave.<p>I hope you've understood that it isn't Arkonviox himself how he is now. Let me say: I think he is nice now. But my problem is not that, it is that he always reminds me of things he has done here in the past. Everytime I see his name or him I feel sad again. That was why I reacted very cruel when Arkonviox returned a few days back. And this all still reminds me of the old days when I was constantly in a bad mood because Arkonviox was constantly nitpicking some people of this website. And this won't change in future, everytime I see his name, he will remind me of these days and I will be sad. And I really hope you can understand that because not it would be really sad.<p>OK, Arkonviox and me made a compromise yesterday, to solute this problem and tried to give the best possible for both of us. And we came to the conclusion that he will only stay on his website and I will only stay here.<p>Isn't that the best thing to be solved? I know it is selfish of me, but I can't change it.<p>Cortex, you are right, Arkonviox is the one who wants to be friends with me and I'm the ass in this situation because I can't get alonge with him, so I should be the one who has to leave. That is why I talked to Arkonviox to solute this. But you also have to see it like that: Arkon has left but he is still connected to this community by his big website. As I've heard there is much life in it again. When he left from here he hasn't lost much, all people can still talk to him on his website.<p>Now what if I left? What would be there for me? Nothingness. Obviously I can't go to his site, and if I can't stay here where should I go to meet all of you? I like you all very much and I don't want to leave you. If I leave now I wouldn't ever see you again.<p>Now isn't it just fair that Arkonviox left? Maybe still you think it isn't, but I can't change it, and if you hate me now all I can say is I'm sorry, but I couldn't change it.<p>And if you want to talk to Arkonviox, you can go to his site. I know he can't take part in our talks from now on and I know that was a main part of what you wanted to reach for him, that he can take part in our community again, but that was a price he had to pay now and I want to excuse that.<p>Well, unfortunately there isn't a working ability of ignoring someone in chat and on a forum, because of you ignore him you would perhaps miss important things the person who you ignore has said and other persons answered to. I hoped to solute it that way, but it doesn't work.<p>Well, it's not different with me and his website, I also would like to post there since I looked into it yesterday for a long time again. Well, at least in some posts I see there, cause people like EccoChick are making fun of Blackfin there, but that's not the topic here now.<p>And I also heard from some people that they said they only stay on Arkonviox' site because that place is much cooler and more lifeful than this place and they already left from here.<p><br>I want to excuse me for me being the reason for Arkonviox to leave. Especially to EccoChick and Coral and Dolphingirl and Cortex and all other people who like Arkonviox very much and would like to have him back here. I am very sorry and I'm sad to be the selfish ass who only tried to have a balance of giving the best for both of us, Arkonviox and me, if you will hate me from now on I both will understand it and won't understand it.<p>I wish this all could be soluted so everybody is nice, but that isn't possible.<p>"This is a big COMMUNITY - Let's try to make it the best for EVERYONE here"<p>-PsySonic

Z||000003||Ecco The Dolphin||01-16-2001||07:09 PM||eccodolphin@hotmail.com||It's time to put grudges in the past.  Arkonviox may have not been the kindest before, but I know that many others here have made mistakes and errors as well.

It would be much more easier for both of you - and for the others who likes Arkonviox. Throw this sadness off of your heart and you feel a very better person.

Z||000009||PsySonic||01-19-2001||10:25 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/psysonic.jpg">  Yes guys... I think you've opened my eyes... I think I have to forgive Arkon now because from now on won't even become better when he would be away because I feel very bad being the one who made him leave. I guess it is the right way to forgive him and I also think that this community will become closer after this war is finally over.<p>I feel sorry for slowing down this but I accept it now and I agree with him coming back again.<p>I guess that is it then <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

However, his internet is temporarily down, and may not be back, any where, for a few weeks. But I'm glad you made that decision PsySonic...<IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">!
