Uh, no... our local video stores have practically no Dreamcast games anyway, because I think they were making room for that God cursed Playstation 2's games... (mutters about SHIT).<p>I've played Sonic Shuffle though, and for all the bad reviews it got, I didn't think it was even <i>close</i> to being that bad. I really didn't.

Blackie, you <I>need</I> Dreamcast games.  We have the best lineup EVER, and you only have Ecco?  I love Ecco, but it ain't exactly big on replay value....
