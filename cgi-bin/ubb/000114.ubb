A||||7||PsySonic||LITTLE debug menu in Ecco 2 Beta

You simply have to pause the game in a 3D Level. At the first glance there seems to be nothing but when you press left/right and up/down you can change something. I remember I saw you can change the difficulty by pressing up/down (1 - 3). What happens by pressing left/right - I think it was something about speed control or so but I really can't remember. Ah, I only saw the correct screen with the correct letters one time - if you try it you might only see some weird sprites which change by pressing up/down and left/right - Try it!<p>Perhaps we can enter new stages by changing the difficulty and drowning! Let's try a bit around.<p>Bye, Psy.

Although it remembered me more of a Jump and Run game - not the typical Ecco style... <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><p>I also liked the other levels there is a total of 18 in the beta! and you can also rebuild the asterite in one level (with teleporting) but the level with the spheres is too incomlete and easy...<br>and I also found an atlantis level with the time machine!<p>and there were many more levels but i can't remember them right now...

I mean in DOF the mutaclone was a dolphin and it hurt you. Or in ecco 2 dolphins hurt you when  morphed, look at it with its beak out look at its dorsal fin shaped like a dolphins.<br>what would you know about the sea when your not a seaman! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Z||000006||PsySonic||09-19-2000||10:11 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||OK OK OK...<p>I've had a closer look at this robotic creature, compared it with sharks and dolphins and I guess you're right - it seems to be a robotic dolphin. It just didn't appeal to me because I never thought of a dolphin attacking Ecco, alike if it's a real or a robotic. The other dolphins attack you when you're a jellyfish just because they CAN'T see you're a dolphin. And I still don't have Ecco for the Dreamcast because I even don't have a Dreamcast itself...<p>Eao, I guess these weird colors are only because you enter a new type of level (with different sprites) but the palette of the previous level remains. It also happened to me. You only have to drown or enter the debug menu again and press C+Start to reset the level.
