Z||000000||GTK||06-04-2001||12:28 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Tidesinger 2 will have our hero traveling into a Clan-like future when something goes horrendously wrong in the distant past. Without giving too much away, Ecco will meet a group of friendly dolphins in this altered world (they will help him complete his task), and I thought it might be cool if... you know, a few cameos from the forum. <p>There are only a few character places available, so if your avatar fancies becoming immortalized in fanfiction, reply to this post NOW. I'll put characters in on a first-come-first-served basis. Be prepared to contribute a bit of basic information about character's personality etc. <p>Heh... this will be fun...

Blackfin knows me and my art is featured in this site's Art section. My dolphin persona is named Swift Current, but you all can call me what u want. Lots of people know me by the nick BlackFox, but it's up to you. BlackFox, BlackDragon, Swift Current...whatever you feel more at home calling me is fine.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">   <br> As for your fan fiction, I think that having "cameos" of forum members is a great idea. I did that once with a Sonic the hedgehog fanfiction I wrote using friends from a message board. Actually...I'm still working on it.... <IMG SRC="smilie17.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="eek">

Z||000005||Trace Kyshad||06-05-2001||08:08 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||I may actually start some proper fully fledged Sci Fi-Fantasy Dolphin/Ecco Fanfic at some point...<p>Anyway, my char ain't really a Dolphin, or whale, or any kind of normal seabound creature, so I guess that leaves me out for now <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
Z||000006||Coral||06-06-2001||11:48 AM||ntraver@epix.net||You can use me if you want to.<p>Coral is a bridled dolphin(a type of spotted dplphin) with just one star on her forehead.<br>She has tele kinetic(being tele kinetic means that you can move things with your mind) and telepathy powers.<p>She's nice but has a very short temper.
Z||000007||Trellius||06-07-2001||06:11 PM||thedolphin@ananzi.co.za||Wow! That WOULD be an honor! I hope I'm not too late! Please let me not be too late!
