There is no greater feeling than solving a puzzle, even if it took a few hours of exploring and dying (which can become EXTREMELY irritating!).  It also devalues the personal gaming experience.  Anyone can buy a strategy guide or read a walkthrough and beat the game in one day, but it just doesn't feel the same as doing it yourself.  So who out there has beat this game without help from another?

Well, I beated Ecco doft without it, but I was stucked at perpetual fluidity (level 16) for some hours. In moments like that, some hints will  be valuable, yes, a lot, and I was tempted to take a look on the guide. I think the best choice  is to use the hints only when you are -really- stucked. But it always steals some  game essence, the puzzles. If you pay some $$ for a game, and you beat it on a day with a walkthrough in each level, what kind of fun is that?

As soon as I got the water level up high, I just swam for hours going back and forth and back and forth.  Yes that was perpetual hell.  I even jumped out of the water into open gateway that had no water.  I thought all you had to do was roll ecco to the other side.  Boy was I wrong.  I cannot begin to tell you how many times I fell to my death in hanging waters.

I looked at the walkthrough for the earlier levels and you have done a wonderful job.  I agree with silverfin.  If it takes so long that you are starting to despise the game itself, then maybe a little help would be recommended.
