Since I type so fast and frequently (130 words per minute) I've developed Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.  if I move my hand a certain way, it just incredibly hurts.  I can do four things about it-I can try taking medicine, but that only works for 1/5 of it's takers.  I can wait for it to go away, and do excersize to help my hand..but that's unlikely.  I can <IMG SRC="smilie21.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH=17 BORDER=0 ALT="errr"> get surgery...but that'll be the last choice I make.  Or, I can get an anti-inflammatory shot.  They inject anti-inflammatory stuff into my hand/wrist and pull out all the things that's clogging my nerves...aargh!!!!  I hate this so much!!!!  I have a picture of the surgery, I'll post that soon if people want me to.  But I just hate the idea of them taking knives and just....slicing my wrist open....I'd rather have the shot, but that's..sick.  I imagine them pulling this yellow-marshmallow stuff out of a large syringe...after injecting this yellow liquid...I think I have a cyst in my wrist, that's what my dad says (hey, it rhymes), and he had CTS...ARRGH!!!!!!!  SHIT!!!!

Surgery wasnt that bad and i was the scaredest person in the world of it.  It was cool at the end, they pushed me out in a wheel chair!<IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  lol  that was a blast.  Well   a new record   i only punched   ONE  nurse   YEAAAAAA!  *EccoChick gives her self a pat on the back.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">  im a violent one when im scared.But yogoat   dont be scared.  It wasnt even  THAT  sore afterwards.  If i was you   id try the medicine, then move to that therepy exercise thing, then , surgery.   And are you serious about the typing giving it to you?   that is weird    :friek:<br>

Recently I've managed stupidly fast typing, and tend to go a little supersonic (Seriosly, I scare my friends at school by doing this).<p>But the idea of cutting into my wrist... Ewww. I think I'll slow down for now In case the worst happens. I always find that things do go away after time, but if it really bothers you, you should probably go for one of the last two. Maybe medicine first, and if that doesn't work go for the surgery. You'll probably feel really terrible as it comes up and as it's being done, but afterwards, you'll feel much better.<p><br>I'm thankful to say, I've never needed any surgery on anything. Not even a broken bone. The idea of it scares the hell out of me.<br>

I thought you were joking about that carpal tunnel syndrome on chat.  i'm so sorry to hear about that.  maybe you should start typing like i do, with 2 fingers!  i can go at a goood speed and i barely stress out my hands at all.  i don't know much about this medical condition, but i'll look up on it.  just take it easy, you're too young to develop any big problems like this.
