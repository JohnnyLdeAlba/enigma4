While I've visited this site before, this is my first time posting.  I've been an Ecco fan for nearly a decade now, and while I have'nt had the treat of playing Ecco<IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">oTF, I still adore the older games.  The complex and beautiful story, the graphics, everything!

Glad to see so many new people joining this group. You will enjoy this place, people are all nice here! Well, until I got Ecco DotF last Christmas I also thought the same way you do. But you should get this awesome game someday - you will be amazed what Appaloosa is able to do there. And actually I also wonder how they will do on the newer consoles since the sequel won't be on Dreamcast <i>*sigh*</i> Oh well... I guess they will do even better - That's the only good point about it <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Don't listen to blackfin because he asked me to make the design for him and code it all, but then he just added his name everywhere.  Anyways, DoTF is a spelling error!  The T shouldn't be capitalized, it's not proper english for titles, and it's either that or they should've capitalized the o!
