Well, I played it quite often the last days and looked a little closer for minor graphical things. There were many amazing things but you won't recognize them in the game when you don't look at the levels carefully. Did you ever have them same thoughts at some parts of the game?<p>Let's exchange such things. I'm curious what you might have ready for us so we can take a closer look at those things.<p>I for excample found out about a tractor beam in "Process that never ends" where you catch those purple stones and move them around in the level. It was fun and actually it isn't really useful... But still it was nice.<p>Hey, did you ever take a close look at the outside walls of the shrine in "Shrine of Controversy"? There are pictures of Divers and Dolphins wearing the Labor Harness - quiet interesting. You find those pictures also as BW drawings in the credits. Actually the Credits have many cool drawings there. They are nice (like the music there <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>Hmm... And did you ever recognise the seagulls in "Hanging Waters" at the long tubes before the octopus? They even fly into the tubes! That was really funny <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>What else do you know?

Some of them just look like the dolphins are being flat out abused...thought it was sad. But yeah...I have seen them. And about the seagulls in Hanging Waters, I've just seen them fly awfully close to the water tubes...never in or through them...heheh!<p>Anyway...that's cool you're being so observant with the wonderful game Sonic... <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">

You work your way to the top in "Man's Nightmare" and then go straight back down, only to work your way up "Hanging Waters" to get back to the top again...<p>I noticed the pictures of the Labour harness on the temple a couple times, and the fact your could shift the crystals around (I thought this was all part of the puzzle actually... oh dear god I took ages). <p>Then there's the Dolphin Soccer... Say no more<p>THe level "Seeds of poison" bears incredible similarity to the beginning of "up and down" (Same place, different timeline <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> )<p>

I'm curious what you might have ready for us so we can take a closer look at those things.<p>I for excample found out about a weird thingy one day.  If you go to where the octopus is in Hanging Waters, go through one of those tubes, and just stay in until you get to a big brown thing with the three tubes of water in it where you sonar it and the tubes turn off, if you jump in it it gets all messed up and you fall and go into the rock and die!<br><i>takes a big breath of air</i><br>And also, with Atlantis, go in those rings and jump straight up.  I saw people falling from mid air!!  it was hillarious.<p><font size="1" color="0000FF"><br>This is in no way intented to be mocking psysonic or anyone else.  I just like his face pic and what he says at the beginning.<br></font>
