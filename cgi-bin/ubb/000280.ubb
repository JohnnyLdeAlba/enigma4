I'm still an ass hole but I am a great asshole. Mwa ha ha he he he. For those of you who dont know me I like blackfin am making my own Ecco fan based game. So far my brother has made lots of artwork to illustrate what my stories gonna be like! But I have been lagging on my part to focusing on C++/direct-X study and my story. But I will have a game at the least!<p>Of course I won't be in often anymore because I am constantaly working at my job plus I have a website of my own plus the only way to get this site to come up is through a long distance provider! Yeah this website doesnt come up in my city richmond in california! <p>So I'm still at the same place I've been doomed to arkonviox.com my home! I think it's my web providers fault for making it hard to get to good ol new zealand! So If you though I died remember how I wrote my story...<p>"Arkonviox is an immortal, let it be stones or drought that will open his wounds but in the end Arkonviox will never die!"<p>As arrogant as I may sound thats how my chracters portrayed. Arkonviox is my Ecco chracter who closley matches me! So let it be known that I won't fall to nobody! But at the least I'm glad to be back!!!! and missed this place!!!!<p>"It's the heart of the savoir that keeps the flow of the tides of time."<p><br>
