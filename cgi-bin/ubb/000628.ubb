People are very nice to talk to! Who agrees?<br>If you have a problem with this community, Cortex (which seems to be so very much) you should either start "good and funny" things by yourself or think about leaving...<br>And actually I think that good and funny things are always here, I have fun!

You have no idea how much of an asshole you sound like telling us to amuse you when you yourself have never said or done something remotely funny.... the only thing we can laugh at about you is your spelling and punctuation skills.  Am I right, group?

At last somebody spoke it out! I wanted to say it, too, but I thought I don't want to cause any trouble anymore. But it was right to say it, Histronic!<br>He doesn't recognize that we all try to ignore him so that he maybe finally leaves someday. But now with this post he has said the worst of all time he has been here, and that is why I'm gonna reply now.<br>I've recognized that everybody was nice to each other here recently, BUT YOU, Cortex were always aggressive, annoying and apathetic! You replied every post of Blackfin to attack him. And also other people have got vacant replies from you which made them all being annoyed. You talk about yourself as if we would find it funny what you post here all the time. Just one small quote out of the bunch of stupid things you've made:<br>{quote} ...i'm also ten and around here i make fun of blackie... {/quote}<br>Do you think anyone of us smiled or found it funny when he read it? Maybe because we thought how mindless and dumbass that was of you. You impersonate a person of this community here and I think you should better learn to avoid this FROM NOW ON or you will get problems sometime soon with everybody of us, that is fact!<br>And now better behave!<br>(I'm sorry to post this, gang, but it had to be said sometime - I think you agree even if you will say different...)

To tell you the truth, somehow I always seem to shrug off everything he says... I mean think about it?!? He's 10, trying to act like a little punk (of which he's not very good at)...the poor kid is just trying to fit in, and he's just chosing a bad way to do it. I don't know...though...but Cortex, I think you'ld be making a wise decision to just...<b>simmer down</b> a little bit!!! I mean, it seems like every post you make is trying to start sh** with people...and I truly mean <i>every single post</i>! Just...think about laying off a little...man...what you're doing is not that cool...
Z||000007||blackfin||01-29-2001||12:42 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I'm not a person who gets annoyed easilly, aslong as Cortex doesn't start outright flaming people I don't have a problem, can everybody please just simmer down a bit...
Z||000008||Cortex Vortex||01-29-2001||04:05 AM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||what do you people think i am a genius you got me all wrong i don't even know what simmer down means and as for you psysonic you drove arkon away and now your trying to do something bad to me you people will never understand me and i am glad of that because if you understood me i would have to take your shit oh and dolphingirl what i said it doesn't include you.
Z||000009||Coral||01-29-2001||07:34 AM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/fp/2coral.gif">  Then who does it include? 
Z||000010||vantid||01-29-2001||09:26 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Hey I agree with dolphingirl, cortex. Cortex, you are making yourself look ignorant and unlikable. There are better ways to get noticed than by bashing people and using language of which even I try to avoid. I think your style of how you type your posts is cute, but usually I find its contents offensive and if not then confusing, which I know is what you are going for but you need to ease off it. It seems the only time you make sense is when you are insulting people, and that's not a good thing. So try to be a little more courteous, k? <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">  
Z||000011||PsySonic||01-29-2001||01:09 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||<img src="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/psysonic.jpg" width=64 height=64 border=0 align="left">Nope, Cortex, I'm not trying to do something bad on you. Yes, I thought about if you should leave, but after the Arkonviox things I think the driving- people-away-time should be over. And so I think that we all should rather tell people if they are annoying and do crap, cause that will help them and us more than just drive 'em away to get rid of them...<br>And for the Arkonviox thing, Cortex, just to make it for you to understand... I really overreacted, but that was only because I didn't want to leave and haven't thought enough about how to deal with the situation first. That was why I left this site for some days to think about it and now it's all OK. Arkonviox and me are becoming pals from now, even if he can't get internet access. And if you can't forgive me for that, then please tell me so that I know how childish YOU really are!<br>Please calm down, and we will be all fine!
Z||000012||BigBlu5||01-30-2001||10:11 PM||jsklages@cfl.rr.com||Cortex, you.ve got to learn to take these things with a grain of... what was it again? Oh yea! Acid!  J/K  That would hurt.  But really cortex, you got to learn how to bounce back and not start a war...
Z||000013||Cortex Vortex||01-31-2001||02:47 AM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||blackie please delete this topic i don't want to have this conversation.

You offend us all the time! If you say you stop it and also do so, it would be all good. Do you think when Blackie will delete this topic it would be everything fine and you could go on with your annoying posts. No, Cortex... You've started this little piece of crap, now you also've got to end it!!!
Z||000016||yogoat||01-31-2001||02:10 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||Aye, dudes, I'm sure he didn't mean for it to branch out like that...
Z||000017||Cortex Vortex||01-31-2001||11:15 PM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||ok i'm sorry now blackie please delete this topic.
Z||000018||blackfin||02-01-2001||12:56 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Ok, everybody just cool down, there is no need to start yelling at each other.
Z||000019||yogoat||02-01-2001||05:44 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||Pray tell, oh black one, why <i>won't</i> you delete this topic?  I bet it'll just turn out into a flame war, and nothing productive is going on here...
Z||000020||blackfin||02-02-2001||03:15 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I hate dominering moderators who delete posts left right and center, so I only ever delete things if I see no other option.  This thread is about burnt out, everybody about has had their say so it will just fade away anyway unless somebody drags it back up again.
Z||000021||Cortex Vortex||02-02-2001||04:04 AM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||This will be my last say at this topic some of you people that replied here are looking for a war to be started look at what i said at the beggining who do you think is the bad person here i didn't say anything that's to bad and remember i said some of you people not all.
