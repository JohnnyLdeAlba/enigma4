Or was he one of the ones that went over to FROM SOFTWARE and is now working on Virtual Ocean?  I remember that add too, and I think I still have it in one of my Sega Visions from back in the day!
Z||000004||blackfin||05-14-2001||04:41 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I think he is working on Virtual Ocean.  I'd never seen that add before, back when it was released I simply didn't have the cash to by gaming mags, it took me months just to save up for a game O_o

Z||000007||blackfin||05-15-2001||06:40 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Kewlness, I have no idea if that is the real deal but it's kewl seeing that add anyway, I wasn't around really into games for the start of ecco so I never saw things like this, I wonder if there are any Ecco:ToT adds out there?

I wanna go find it on Adcritic or summit...
Z||000011||blackfin||05-31-2001||08:10 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I WANT IT!  *runs about madlly*  I wish I had more cash...  When I start working I'm going to offer bounties to people who find things like that... I hope somebody can find it anyway....  That sounds really interesting...
