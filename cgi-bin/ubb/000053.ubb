A||||7||dragonboy||new idea for online ecco
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-06-2000||09:19 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||Here's a cool idea.  there should be a fighting contest between pod members in  special areas.  These would not be out of malice, but like it is in Fight Club.  Some of these fights could help determine pod rank, but if you challenge too much and or lose to often, you may lose your current rank.  If you win often, not only does rank increase, but some special abilities.

Z||000002||blackfin||09-07-2000||02:24 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||your not the only person collecting ideas...   any idea that gets mentioned on the forum is added to my collection of idea for my game...
Z||000003||dragonboy||09-07-2000||06:45 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||Arkonviox does raise a question.  What if appaloosa does use ideas we put up here on the forum?  How would you feel?  On one hand I'd be honored that my idea was used, but on the other, I feel as if I should at least be personally involved.  Who knows, maybe someone on the forum is a spy from appaloosa.   I mean there are some people who pop in and out once a week or less.  In any event, I want help develop an ecco game, or at least be one of their designated testers...that would be awesome.

Z||000005||dragonboy||09-07-2000||07:01 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||so the more ideas we put up here, the more they cannot use?  They could just hire me, I would pick up and move to whatever city they are located...with good pay of course!  Working designs...they make some pretty cool RPGs.  
Z||000006||blackfin||09-08-2000||01:19 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Sheesss I'm glad I'm not a professional game designer...  I don't have to worry about things like that <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
Z||000007||Arkonviox||09-08-2000||10:02 PM||www.arkonviox@prodigy.net||Dam you mean I have to give my game away for free...sheeeesh I knew that from the start but I could always make my own idea with what I got...yeah right the things I made were created exclusively for ecco like Arkonviox but dont be surprise if I ever make this game but if I do will we see a game with arkonviox in it dam strait we should Arkonviox-the savoir of the future but that would sound like defender which would screw up the intire idea
