A||||5||dragonboy||the chatroom: future possibilities
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-09-2000||01:26 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||last night barbarian and I decided to try out the chatroom, and too much surprise it works well considering.  Silverfin joined in as well.  there's so much more you can learn from each other than just forum posts...and more spontaneity too!  like barbarian was sleeping with 7 guys...cuz his football te team was on an away game and stuck in a small crappy hotel.  Arkon joined in but he seemed to stop chatting.  Anyway, i think if someone has some free time and wants to chat, they should put a new post up and wait in the chatroom for awhile.  the only problem is certain people are only available at certain times.  for example, while it was 10 pm here, it was about 4:30 am where silverfin is.  I guess nothing is perfect.  I hope to speak to all of you someday.  Any way, keep it real.<br>

Z||000002||dragonboy||09-09-2000||04:01 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i won't be able to chat on the weekends until my roomate gets his computer fixed.  until then i have the computer labs during the week.  now my dreamcast is the only internet source i have and it doesn't have  java capability.

Z||000004||blackfin||09-09-2000||05:36 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I am quite serious about being in the chatroom a lot...  I will from now on leave mIRC running in the background logged into the chatroom so at any time I am online I should also be in the chatroom.
Z||000005||dragonboy||09-09-2000||05:55 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||that's good to hear.  i'm looking forward to chatting with you sometime soon.   ut as you know, the dreamcast i use on the weekends won't allow me to do so.  i wish my roomate would hurry up and get his computer fixed.
