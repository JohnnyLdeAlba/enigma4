Z||000000||blackfin||06-19-2001||07:36 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've been conducting research for redoing the chatroom and I'd like opinions on what posibilties you like from what I've come up with....  There are three courses of action I can take;<p>1) I could just leave everything as it is, is anybody so attached to how things are now that you never want them to change?<p>2) I will move irc servers and get a new chat applet, I've found one I'd use if I took this option, it loads much faster as far as I can tell, it seems to be more stable and has small buttons with most of the screen dedicated to the nick list and the chat area, it has popup menus that make it easy to whois people and also has a built in ignore feature so you don't have to listen to people who annoy you.  But... in such a tiny applet some feature are missing, you can only be one one channel at once and private messages are harder to send (you can't popup a second window but must send them from the main one) and irc commands aren't supported   So in other words it's a great way to introduce new people to the chat as it loads super fast and is very simple to use but people who chat a lot would probally want to use mIRC (which isn't too hard now with my guide)  So Do/don't you like the sound of that?<p>3)  I've found a graphical java chat similar to chatpop for those who have used it.  Basically there is background for the room (I'd use a nice ocean sceen) then everybody in the chat appears as an icon (there are dozens of premade ones of you can make your own), what you say appears in a speach bubble above your icon.  This loads quite fast and there is a plain text version for those who don't like all the graphics, you can write a profile to attach to your nick so people can look you up in the chat.  The main disadvantage of this is that there is now downloadable client so you would have to load the chat in a webpage.  So what do you think, is it kewl or just a gimic?<p>Well I'm very interested to hear what people think, what people say right now will determine what I do with the chatroom so please take time to say what you think now rather than complaining if I do someting you don't like later....<p>

Z||000002||blackfin||06-19-2001||08:34 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well a few more details, I'm basically taking a vote here (oh and no 'clever' ideas like voting with multiple nicks please, that will only ever count once) s thats why it's important that everybody says someting even if it's just saying 1, 2 or 3 or else the futur of the chat will be decided by just a few people....
Z||000003||GTK||06-19-2001||08:47 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Well, I've never actually been able to use the chatroom myself for some reason, so I'm ill-placed to comment. (can't load it in either of my browsers and I'm never on the IRC-compatible comp when I need to chat). But, generally speaking, I'd like to see a chat that's simple and easy to load. You lot may all have T1 connections and so forth, but living in Britain I'm stuck with our ancient copper-wire network and it can make things difficult when I try to do complex stuff online. To give an example, I've got a 56K modem but I have witnessed transfer speeds of 6 bytes per minute at peak times. >_< <p>So... something simple and easy to load for me ^^ Or something funky and complicated that has an easy-loading option for me ^^ #3 sounds fun but I also like the idea of #2. That's my two cents, pennies, sprats, whatever. 
Z||000004||yogoat||06-19-2001||10:50 AM||||Hmm....I'd have to say #3!  seems pretty cool...or why not put 'em all up, then they can take a vote for the website poll?
Z||000005||Trellius||06-19-2001||04:42 PM||thedolphin@ananzi.co.za||I myself am using mIRC and find it the best so far....though option 3 sound interesting, provided it is fast and stable.
Z||000006||dolphingirl||06-20-2001||03:17 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Well, I do kinda like how things are right now...(I've got a room of my own on the same server)...it'd be nice to not have to have so many windows open at once, as I'm also a regular visitor at the Arkonviox.com chat room. --However-- #3 does sound kinda different, and could be fun! Maybe you could use one for a trial period...and see everyone's comments. Trial them both, and see which one worked out best for everyone! Your description could be fine and all, but getting some servers to work like they're supposed to is another story. Bottom line though...I'll be fine with whatever...but my thoughts on the matter were listed above...hope it helps in some way... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">
Z||000007||blackfin||06-20-2001||08:16 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well I think from what has been said so far what I'll do is when I get time (It may be a week as I'm just over a week away from finishing the first half of my course and there are final tests and assignments due soon O_O) I'll setup the 3rd option and see what people think over a week, I haven't had time to test it heavilly get either and  have no idea what things may be bad I dont' know about it, I forgot to mention it even has a text only chat option so that should be fine for people with super slow connections and no java support.  I personally want to try someting other than irc for a change and I think I can made a program to give everybody start menu shortcuts straight to the chat if they want so it will be faster to get there, almost like having a program.  I'm sorry to those who want to keep things the way they are but to be frank my chat is dead, almost nobody bothers to visit these days, I can be there for hours alone.... something needs to be done.....  If I don't do something I may as well just take off the chat page for the use it gets....  Anyway you'll soon have the new chat to look at, I'll also show you the alternative irc applet and you can take your pick (I'll take a vote on it)
Z||000008||Eao||06-22-2001||04:16 PM||collprin@warwick.net||Face pics!  that are like animated...so people see the mouth go up n down.<p>Or um....somthing with faces and colors...yeaheyaheyaheyah  and a send option...and um  vocaling!
Z||000009||Trace Kyshad||06-22-2001||05:45 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||What would be nice is if you moved the thing to Mysteria's server, because all time I spend on Mirc is in #srb2 (Some may have heard of it, but that place is now Sonic Fangame Central)<p>But hey, I'm too busy to chat<p>*Shuffles orf*
Z||000010||blackfin||06-23-2001||08:17 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well unfortunatlly I'm tied to the server that my java applet vomes from, it can't be pointed to any server like Arkons.  I'm planning to write my own chat applet one day with many features but I need a dedicated server for that so it will be atleast a year off...
Z||000011||yogoat||06-23-2001||12:12 PM||||So why not just get Arkon's applet?
Z||000012||Reptyx||06-23-2001||03:51 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com||hey blackfin, this hasn't got much to do with the chatroom itself, but anyways:<p>how about a field in the profiles where ppl can enter which hours and days they're usually in the chatroom? Or maybe we could put it in our description field.<p>
Z||000013||blackfin||06-24-2001||08:05 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Arkon's applet costs cash I don't have.<p>i've considered ideas like yours REptyx but I've actually got something planned for my final website update when I finish the forum soon, I think it's way better, but thanks for the idea.
