Now I havta ink it and color it in, which would take awhile.<br>Also in art class I did a drawing of Miana in her human form and a bunch of the guys in my class said she looked hot <IMG SRC="laugh.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh"><p>*wonders if there was any point to this* Ah oh well, I'm just happy so I'll shut up for now. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><p><br>Miana<br>"If you had to indentify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be 'meetings'"<p><br>

Looks like the evil-looking dolphins are getting popular in this forum...<p> <IMG SRC="http://www.ctv.es/USERS/stenellas/armored-bladedolphin_quality8.jpg">

The dolphins that I'm drawing look pretty friendly and playful. They are both poking their heads out of the water and I think I'll make the second one Blackfin. I'm working on my Coral right now and hopefully I'll be able to show them to you.

I wonder if he draws first with a pencil and scans the pic to work on, or he just do all the work with the pc.<p><br>I hope to see your pics here soon...<br>
