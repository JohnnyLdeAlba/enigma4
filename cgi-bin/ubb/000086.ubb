I think ecco:dotf sales around the world prove how many people want to play a game about a dolphin.

How many ppl who one Shoot-'em-up games enjoy ecco?  Or people who live on Sport or racing games dare tred into ecco's world?  U tell me.<p>Thats the only reason why i got Sega a while ago.

I'm sorry if I may have sounded hostile (actually it was just surprise, since i know you're a fan).  But i like the MK series, Doom, and I'm mostly an RPG player, but ecco holds a very strong position in my video game heart.
