I find it hard to believe no one has told you it looked cool...because it is!!! I really like how you can barely see the sun in the upper rt. corner! I like the dolphins spots, and the (only) star on it's head is way cool!!! Did Mr. Cool Crestoe do it too? <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><br>

Z||000011||dragonboy||11-01-2000||06:54 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||really, I didn't!  I think you face pic is cute.  is that the word i want, cute?  If i say cute, will people think i'm gay or something.  what is the social acceptibility of guys saying something is cute.  well my pets are cute, our bulldog at home (i'll show you sometime) is cute.  Ahhh i don't care, i'll say what the hell i wanna say. screw society's little streotypes <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge">.<br>

I don't anyway.<br>P.S. Would you say hi to a friend of mine? Her name is Tigress. And she's new at the forum. She's already posted a topic. She's really excited about this site.<br>
