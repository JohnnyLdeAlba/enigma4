You find links to download that some of the cutscenes music <A HREF="http://www.besonic.com/User/0,1391,g0r0l0t0o0i96563,FF.html">here</A> there is link to find music from the other cutscenes some where on the composers homepage <A HREF="http://www.larendor.homestead.com/">here</A> as far as I recall..

I have two mp3s that are not on the page I gave a link to and I cannot work out where I download the others from... I'm sure I found a link to another music website with more mp3s on it a while ago... <IMG SRC="confused.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="confused">
