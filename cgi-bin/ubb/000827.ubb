Z||000000||blackfin||05-29-2001||07:36 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||There is an odd bug I've been puzzling over for years in the Ecco:ToT level 'The lost Orcas" (the second part of asterites cave) for the Mega Drive/Genesis. If you play the level on hard difficulty there are a number of broken glyphs scattered about the level that appear, as shown in the screenshot.<p>[imghttp://www.ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz/infos_interestingthings_md_ecco2_thelostorcas.jpg[/img]<p>Those glyphs need their top half before they can be made whole and do anything...  but there are no top halves, only bottom halves in the level, you can't move them either they are stuck in place...  So what are they there for?  I have two possible ideas, one they are just a strange bug or two the level orginlly had more puzzles in it on hard difficulty but they were taken out at the last minute reculting in half the glyphs from them being left behind.  What do you think?  Does anybody else have any more information or ideas on this?
