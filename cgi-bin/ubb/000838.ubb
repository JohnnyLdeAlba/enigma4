Z||000006||blackfin||06-05-2001||04:43 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well if Crestoe wants to continue Arkonviox.com on my server after your current hosting payments run out I would be kewl with it but I don't know if I could get it setup <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">  My websites admin has been next to useless lately, I asked them to do something simple a month ago and they still haven't done it....  but you said it was paid for a while yet though so in that time I may get one of my plans finished that should make it possible.  I'll be awaiting your return Arkon,  hope things work out ok.  ummm if you don't mind me asking... why did you get kicked out?

I'm sorry you have to go through all this...but just know I'll always be here for ya budday...when ever ya need me...k?! So,...I'll talk to you later tough guy...hang in there! <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000016||blackfin||06-08-2001||07:16 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||That sucks Arkon I agree with dg totally, your mother has no right to tell you what name you should have, specially at your age! If my parents tried to tell me what to do right now I'd kick their butts <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"> and in protest change my name to 'Jason Blackfin' and totally disown them <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"> (in case you haven't noticed I kind of tend to HATE being ordered about) You did the right thing standing up for yourself, one of my friends has parents that are total control freaks and he gives in and I can tell you he is in a real mess right now thanks to that <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">  It's great to hear that you won't be vanishing off into the navy. ^_^  I hope you manage to get things sorted soon.
Z||000017||Riveler||06-09-2001||12:33 AM||riveler@uol.com.br||Hi, Arkon! I do not know you too much but one thing I know: you and your mom had a misunderstanding 'mother-son' time and both of you seem to be heat headed (you are for sure!). I think you should wait a little, try to calm down and go talk to your mother. Explain her you feelings and I'm sure you will get to an understanding.<p>PS.: try to control your temper! Your name sound italian to me! If you are italian descendent maybe this can be difficult to do  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">   
Z||000018||blackfin||06-09-2001||10:08 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Um she seems to want to change his name against his will and stop him from controling his life at his age.  I can sure understand him being hot headed, I'd blow my top if my parents tried that. His mother seems to have not realised that you can't control somebody at that age...  but then again one of my friends have clueless parents like that and they still don't get that they can't treat an 18year old like a kid, they still have NO idea why their kids hate them and won't do a thing they ask... <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="roll eyes"> <p>(sorry but I'm kind of biased towards Arkon in this because I know somebody who is being totally messed up by control freak parents like Arkon's mother, Arkon is lucky to just have one, he has TWO of them O_o)

Z||000028||yogoat||06-12-2001||05:02 PM||||Bag...as in books?  I was thinking about that the other night, here's my idea...<p>Why not just have a computer school?  You get your laptops, or rent them, and have RJ45 network ports in each and every computer.  I'm thinkin this would be for middle school (sixth grade) and up.  So, anyways, it'd be just like an advanced college...large lecture halls with bleachers (or however you might spell it), a nearby dormitory...all inside a large metal fence, so idiot kids can't get out.  Anyways, the text-books would all be on CD-ROMs, and to get the assignments, there would be RJ-45 ports inside the bleachers...so you could just "download" your homework!  Then all you'd have to do is carry around a laptop, and that'd be it!  Of course, if you lost/busted any of the stuff, you'd have to pay for it...What do you guys think about that?
Z||000029||vantid||06-12-2001||06:05 PM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Like a backpack? Yeah, i wieghed my backpack once.....38 pounds....whatever that is in kilos or some fud up shod like that. yeah, yoyo, that is a good idea, and some schools actually consider similar ideas. My high school (back in the day <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge">) will transfer to a computer book thing in about 4 or 5 years.
Z||000030||yogoat||06-12-2001||09:22 PM||||It's funny, because all the stupid people at my school get computers to use.  I mean, the retards.  Maybe I should say I'm a retard so I can get one...
Z||000031||dolphingirl||06-13-2001||03:04 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Heheh...yeah, that would be cool!
Z||000032||blackfin||06-13-2001||08:07 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||My old school is starting like that, we have just got in laptops to lend to students after one day they were already coming back messed up, that is the big flaw with it, it doesnt' matter if students are liable for damages many are simply too careless to be trusted with a pc anyway, let alone a laptop....<br>
Z||000033||yogoat||06-13-2001||12:39 PM||||Maybe that should be a special option for schools, then...laptop or no lap top.
Z||000034||blackfin||06-14-2001||09:01 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||or else somebody should make student proof laptops <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge">
