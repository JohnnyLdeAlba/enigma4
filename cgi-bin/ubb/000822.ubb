I think it was just called 'Dolphin'. Anyway, it was nothing like that..It was kind of a unique game, though. You were this dolphin swimming away from this big octopus (or squid.. I forget) and the game made a ringing tone that indicated where a passageway was through a line of seahorses that barred your path. Then when the colors of the game changed, you could jump out of the water and touch this seagull that flew overhead, then bump into the octopus/squid to kill it. Sounds complicated, yes, but it was fun.
