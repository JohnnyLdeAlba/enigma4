A||||23||blackfin||There is a lot of confusion with the banning thing lately, I feel I need to say a bit
Z||000000||blackfin||05-15-2001||08:52 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Ok, firstlly this is totally not related to ecco so unless you are interested in this you may not want to read this...<p>Ok, a lot of people have been emailing me and asking what has been happening lately so I'm going to try to explain things from my view point, at the least this should hopefully help people understand why I did what I did.<p>This all started on my return from my trip to America, my visit with Megz had been sweet and everything was going great untill I got a bombshell dropped on me, she was lying and cheating on me!  This was my first relationship and like many other things that have happened in it I had no idea how to handle it, I was very hurt and angry.  I immediatlly dumped Megz and at that point she started telling me how sorry and hurt she was at what had happened, I felt sorry for her and went to try to cheer her up, that was when two things happened, I found she was still lying to me which made me very mad again and right at that point I got a very nasty flame from Crestoe, needless to say bad timing, I was sick of him breaking the rules left right and center, acting with no concern for other people's feelings and with how angry I was with being lied to and with Crestoe trying to tell me how to live my life I banned him, unfortunatlly since arkon and Crestoe are on the same computer that banned both of them.<p>At this point after I cooled off I was quite ready to talk to them and lift the ban but immediatlly Arkon started flamming me and telling me that he had the right to do anything he wanted anywhere he wanted and that he was going to do it no matter what I thought.<p>Here is how I think of websites, each one is like a house having a party, the webmaster is the host for the party, he serves what he chooses to his guests (pages) and if people don't like the part them have the full right to go to another one (website) but if people come into his house and start throwing beer bottles and smashing windows the host (webmaster) has the right to remove them from the house (website).  Arkon was saying that he had the right to smash all my windows, if somebody came to his website and did that they would be banned in short order.<p>I didn't find much from what Arkon was sayin to convince me that it would be a good idea to let him back, he was making very clear he would flame the heck out of my website if he came back so I maintained the ban.<p>At this point Megz was sending me almost hourly emails to try to get me back, that was really hurting getting them, I still love her but I don't believe what she was saying so it was driving me wild, I basically couldn't hack it after a week and banned her because I knew that if I just stopped her email she would go to the forum and try from there (you may have seen her try the guestbook) I didn't feel right doing it, in fact I felt like a complete jerk but I would have had a break down or something if I had to read another one of those emails, they were breaking my heart.<p>At that point a lot of people decided I was being nasty to Megz and I was a horrible person so they decided to support Arkon and thats when things really got bad, lots of people decided to go to Arkon's website, for various reasons, and Arkon started trying attacking people on my website everyway he could, at this point I warned him to stop attacking my website or I'd take counter action by taking down all links to him, he continued so I did. <p>There seem to be a few other things floating around as well, namely the idea that I don't try hard enough, well lets see, I have a course at University that when you combine assignments and classwork takes about 60hours a week, I have three part time jobs, and I am expected to help with housework and have various other respoinsibilities to attend to, in other words I work all day non stop most days, by the time I'm finally free most days it is between 10pm and midnight for me and I have to be up before seven some mornings, needless to say I have very little time, I do what I can, most other webmasters would have given up by now but I won't, considering my workload it's not surprising I can't do as much as some people on their websites I'm simply too busy right now, but I'm trying as hard as I can.<p>The second thing that is going around is the rumour that I never loved Megz, has everybody suddenlly become certified experts or something?  I love megz still so much that every thing that happens is tearing me apart, my heart everyday feels like a knife has been stabbed into it, I KNOW I love her.<p>Thirdly, I have a monopolly on ecco resources O_o um, lets see, I have a website but so do a lot of other people...  All I have that nobody else has is the control of the ecco catagory on a search engine, and I've been very helpful with it, I told people who didn't know about it when I didn't and helped them to be listed which helped their websites when I didn't have to and besides it's not like there is just this search engine on the net and it's not the only way to get listed so I hardly have a monopolly.<p>Well that about sums up how I feel about things, I know I didn't ack as good as I could, I've been a complete jerk at times but I'm under a lot of pressure, I haven't had a time in months when I've been able to sit back and relax truely, there is ALWAYS work to be done.  I have never intended to hurt or insult anybody, but I know I've failed several times, I'm only human.... I'm very sorry for that, I've spent a good part of my life being picked on so hurting other people is the last thing I ever want. I'd like to try to get one with everybody and I'm always ready to try to work things out if other people are but I won't have people acting like a mob on my website which to me is like my house, it's my place and any guest with manners would act in a respectable way.<p>Well thats how I see things, I hope there aren't too many typos (I am writing this very late a night, as often with my website I have to make the time to do anything) I'll be interested to hear what other people make of how I feel...

Z||000004||Evar Reave||05-15-2001||01:05 PM||reave510@go.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/av/2hell.jpg"> <br>Well it's not like i ever wanted to fight you, I came back after having to pay a 2000.00 phone bill and had been very unhappy about how i had to watch Arkonviox.com die and everyone laughing and mocking me while i was at the library or at work saying "you aren't big and bad now that you don't have your website." by all of your visitors<p>I mean i'm not saying i didnt deserve it but i didnt deserve to be treated in the same manner i treat people. if i ever get ignorant and stupid which many times i do thats when it's best to sit me down and have a talk man to man instead of argueing me back.<p>Most all my actions come out of anger and because of it i cant control them to well unless i get my way, this website stuff is very very new to me so when i began arkonviox.com completly i didnt know what i was doing i didnt even know html but withen one month i become a master mimmicing what i seen in other sites and combining it with mine.<p>When i found out about crestoe sending the emails was the cause of the ban when i came home after a boring day of work i was very pissed in a sense but in another way i didnt relly care cause i knew i needed time alone to be on my own website.<p>Everyone knows im the bad guy, everyone knows im wrong but everyone has choosen to side with me and i told them they are all crazy but everyone sided with me cause they are my friends and thats the difference between my website and this one i treat everyone as my friends and trie to please everyone..in a sense where just old assed prostitues giving owrselfs away for the richest prize...a website filled with friends...and thats what i accomplished...<p>After i was banned i stopped caring about anything here so thats why i went nuts and filled "broke" all your windows cause i knew i was gonna be left all alone seprated from my friends and blackfin thats how i seen you along time ago before megz as a friend but then when you got with her you began to neglect everyone...your friends so now that you broke up with her you expect everything to just suddenly go back and everyone be your friend...puh you know as well as i that cant happen people were desqusted with you about it but i think people would like this all to be over including myself so what i want to talk to you about is a comprimise<p>I relize this fighting hasn't accomplished anything except bad feelings and if we can just sit down and all talk i myself am willing to negotiate peace, id be better then having to sit here with bad feelins allt he time. and if you think arkon's giving in your sadly mistaken im doing whats right for my people alot of them are tired of hearing about fights people came here for ecco and came to me for ecco but if you dont want to negiotiate i'll find my own way to fafill there needs but this doesnt end unless we can talk man to man and using the excuse of not being able to have any man to man talk with arkon is the biggest load of  ****  you would ever hear yourself say cause im very very reasonable you just never givin me the opportunity cause you people spend to much time fighting fire with fire rather then saying "why are you doing this"<p>best reguards<br>~Arkonviox<p>P.S if you feel the need to delate this post be my guest weather the post exists or not i still do!
Z||000005||blackfin||05-15-2001||04:37 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||No Arkon I won't delete your post, the reason and only erason I removed any others was because they were flames or in my opintion getting close to flsmes.<p>I think there is something more I need to explain from my perspective....  Going right back to when I first met Megz, I admit I had no life then and plenty of free time, I was excited at my first love and got a bit caught up in it, I wanted to spend time with her and at the same time tried to work as much as I could on the website.  THat was when I hit my first annoyance, I has flammed and got told by angry people that it wasn't good enough and I needed to spend all my time on the website, I got angry at that idea; that I wasn't allowed to have a life and in response I was less motivated to do work for people who treated me like that.  Basically I felt betrayed by a lot of my friends, as far as I saw it I had just had a chance to be happy for the first time in a VERY long time and all my friends were trying to destroy it.  I know that isn't what you were trying to do but that was how it seemed to me at the time, so I pulled away feeling betrayed and didn't care too much about the website, that started a cycle that sprialed down and made them yell at me and then I did less ork and so on.  I pulled away from many of my friends in the start because I felt that I was betrayed first, you were trying to control my life and destroy my happness and I wanted to prevent that, I know now thats not what you intended but you didn't go about it in the best way.<p>Thats basically how I feel about how things happened back then, I'm older and wisher now and I'd like to try to forget the past and move on, I made a lot of mistakes but it was my first love I didn't really know what I was doing... I'm sorry.<p>To put it in my party alternate view, I was hosting my party and got a important call from work, I went to handle it and told everybody I'd be back to continue the party as much as I could but had some very important work to do as well, I promptly gor bear bottles thrown at me, so I went to my study and didn't bother coming back to the party much because I didn't want beer bottles thrown at my head. <p>As far as I see it, peace isn't just an option its an neccesity, both websites are hurting right now and if it gets worse both websites might die, I'm more like Arkon than most people know, just I've learned to control my anger but its got close to coming out over the last few weeks and if it does this war will sprial out of control.<p>I'm not trying to be the best and beat anybody else, all I'm trying to do is build my website how I like it, if I'm the best well thats kewl but if somebody else is the best thats kewl as well, and I want there to be more great ecco websites, I help other websites all I can and the better they get the happier I am.<p>I'd love to try to fix this, let me make something clear as well, I'm not giving in either, I'm simply doing what is right as well, the war is achieving nothing but suffering.  I'm sorry for cutting you off from your friends Arkon that wasn't what I was intending at all, I thought that all your friends went to your website...<br>Anyway what I want before I'll let anybody banned back is an email from them promising that they will follow all website rules in future while here (needless to say if the email isn't followed they will be banned again; if I get an email from arkon and Crestoe promising no more attacks on my website (and provided it is honoured) I will restore all links I took down.   This isn't totally fixed, I'm prepared to negotiate but thats basicsof what I want, no more trying to smash my windows and for everybody to stop throwing bottles about inside my house.  Everybody can enjoy my party (website) if they just will behave.
Z||000006||Evar Reave||05-15-2001||05:32 PM||reave510@go.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/av/2hell.jpg"> <br>There is alot of things i relized, one of them is this war was pointless cause all its doing is killing us both. From what i learned these past weeks about managing a site with lots of people is we are all friends here and have no reason to be fighting owrselves as many of you can see i split the chat room on my site in two because half my people werent getting along with another half and so i almost ended up with a civil war in my hands<p>the worse thing happening was alot of people on my website are very into the idea of fighting but there are alot of people who are sick of that descussion and find it evident to leave the scene completly and thats where i feel this isnt working fighting<p>So id like this all to end here i will talk to me people and make an update if i have to but i still need to talk with you more blackfin id be great if we could just work together strangly were alot alike in some ways but different in others the onlything which make us similar is niether of us will give up on the Ecco idea<p>best reguards<br>~Arkonviox

Z||000009||blackfin||05-16-2001||06:40 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Thanks Whitefin that offer means a lot to me but I'm not really great at talking as you may have noticed so I probally won't take you up on that offer.  T be frank I'm a clutz at expressing myself so I don't try often, I renember trying to explain something a few months ago in the chatroom, it ended up with everybody thinking that I ment this website was only a hobby for me that I didn't really want anybody to visit and I didn't really care about anybody O_o that wasn't what I was trying to say at all, when I first started this website I'd only ever found one other ecco fan on the internet, I never imagined the website being a run away success like it has been, I was thinking of a little hobby that I could work on when I had time and would never get much attention, but instead visitors steadilly increased untill we have what we have today, it wasn't what I orginally thought would happen and it kindof overwhelmed me, I wasn't orginally trying to build a website that would become the center of attention, I hate being the center of attention, its not my thing, but I was flattered that everybody liked what I did and I loved ecco so I went forwards and tried to give everybody as much as I could even though I had never planned or expected this level of interest, that was what I orginally was trying to say but I didn't communicate it very well, like many things I say so everybody mistook it my words and like many things it has been a millstone about my neck ever since, thats why I generally don't talk or explain myself much, I generally make a mess so I find it easier to be not noticed and just fade into the background quietly.  Being the webmaster here has in a way been a struggle for me, I'm so quiet in real life that people don't notice if I am or am not there, having everybody concentrating on me is almost freaky to me, I'm adapting to it and getting more used to it but thats why at times I said I don't want so many visitors, not because I don't care about them but because I get freaked if I get too much attention.  Hmm,but something seems to have changed for me lately, I'm now actually more ready to talk than I usually am, I think many problems over the last 6months have been because I've let misunderstandings go on, and people have slowly built up an idea of how I think that isn't what I really think but I've not tried to explain myself.  I'm now going to try to explain my actions and why I do things.  This thread will probally stay around for a bit now, I have 6months of miscommunication to clear up as I think of it.
Z||000010||vantid||05-16-2001||08:21 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||sighs<p>First off i would like to apologize for any and all slanders pertaining to Blackfin and his site and any memebers on it. Some of it was rather infantile while others i feel were justified for all the afore mentioned points above. Perhaps now we can all get along and help bring attention to apaloosa that there are a ton of ecco fans out there and they cannot let ecco die!

Z||000016||blackfin||05-17-2001||06:39 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Thanks Vantid, I know there is a lot I've not done as well as I could and I want to try to fix that, and ecco will never die, I won't let it! Even with a hate website dedicated to me you didn't see me stop, if you heard any mention of me stopping the website from anybody, well all I would have done if I had done that was worked on things offline for a bit untill things calmed down and came back with a blast <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"><p>A joint thing is actually a good idea I think Vortex, it would bringing the two websites together and all the fans as well, unfortantlly though I'm very independant and so is arkon, I can never see either of us taking orders from the other so I don't really see how it would work with nobody in charge, we would just end up fighting over that.  Anyway I'm snowed under with work from University again, my assignments seem to be breeding in my folders while my back is turned, my assigments have doubled in the last week O_O so I bearlly have time to do the small updates let alone the big updates I have planned for the website so I doubt I'd ever be able to find time for something joint in the near future, but prehaps later...  I've had the idea of a joint email month newsletter which would be worked on by many fans in the future but there just isn't a big enough community for it to work right now.

I only hope that this will last for some more time, the last was a bit short, like 2 weeks or so? Anyway, I also posted about this on Arkons Forum this morning in school, so if you wouldn't have made this peace agreement, I might have finally left this place silently in the next weeks cause all this pointly  ****  stuff was freaking me out! You were quite right there, Arkon! Well, I also have another question, but that is so important that I will post it on both forums in a new topic line...

Z||000019||blackfin||05-19-2001||12:29 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I doubt it will happen again, I've changed lately, and part of how I was acting was due to the whole Megz thing driving me nutz, thats all over now so it shouldn't ever happen again.  I know everything that went wrong I think and the main thing was that I didn't try to try for peace earlier, if I had approached Arkon earlier prehaps we could have nipped this in the bud.
