I saw it last week and I liked it alot! I thought the dinos were very nicely made... not Jurassic Park quality, but still very cool...

Z||000012||Eao||11-26-2000||03:43 PM||collprin@warwick.net||yeah Rep...but i saw in in the theater....there were some flaws.....even ppl who know stuff like that saw it....like um...the lemurs....but the facts were better and more close to home than LBT movies (land before time)...

Tyrannosaurs are cool, but they're a bit unoriginal, don't you think? <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

I've seen "Dinosaur" as well, and I can tell you this:<p>  I liked it so much that I've seen it like (maybe, I'm not sure) 4 or 5 times + bought its Soundtrack.

Z||000024||LionHeart||12-03-2000||12:44 PM||nightfin32@hotmail.com|| What is that thing? Is it a bird or cat?Or is it a pile of roadkill? I dont know what it is well if you guys know PLZ tell me what it is.... PLZ<br>
Z||000025||dragonboy||12-03-2000||03:57 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||ok, ok, settle down lion!  at first when i saw this thing, i thought eao had done something to her poor cat.  but on closer inspection, it seems to be a stuffed rabbit that has been modified to look like a gryphon as eao said.  a gryphon i think is like a flying cat-bird or something like that
