That´s not so bad but the SoE made some staff restruturaction and the guy responsible for bringing Ecco-DC has gone. My deepest fears:<br>- is there any chance of a new Ecco game on DC? I'm really afraid, guys! the DC is probably my last video game I woudn't buy another one just to play Ecco. I've already sent a e-mail to Appaloosacorp.com, but still no answer...

Sega is Sega, Nintendo is Nintendo and Sony is Sony, and that should ever be, that is! ~~>:-<
