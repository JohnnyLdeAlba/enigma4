I know it has dolphins, though. <br>What is it like?<p> <IMG SRC="http://www.theidiots.org/orion/xsig2.gif"> 
Z||000009||dragonboy||10-10-2000||11:26 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||too many movies too mention so here are a few:<br>Disney's robin hood---me too delphi!<br>ace ventura 1- super funny movie plus it had a dolphin, yay<br>batman: mask of the phantasm<br>clockwork orange<br>pink floyd's the wall (kind of a movie, more of a rock opera)<br>many more which i cannot recall right now<p>i recently added another favorite movie thanks to the recomendation of silverfin, the big blue.  well crispy, it has dolphins, but the movie centers around life-long friends who have excelled in free-diving the ocean.  their competition with each other is a basis of their unusual, but touching friendship.  but the main theme of the story centers around the frenchman and his strong bond with the sea and its inhabitants.  it is a very psychological and long (you must see the real , unedited, uncut version for the best intended cinematic experience.) but this movie may not be for you.
