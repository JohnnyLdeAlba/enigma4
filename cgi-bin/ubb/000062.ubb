It's kind of sad now, I'm gonna miss old sharky boy and the hours I spent with him, many are the nights, we played cat and mouse, and how I've fed him quite well with my plentiful supply of dolphins..oh well, so it wasn't a glitch after all just some lousy gameplay on my part...Thanks again, I'll try to more creative with my gameplay in the future..
