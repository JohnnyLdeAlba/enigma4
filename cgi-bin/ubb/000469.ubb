Go down by them and catch it in your mouth.  Swim up and give it to the sick baby orca and follow him. Ok, it's  a long way up, and when you finnaly reach the surface you have no air and a sliver of life.  Then the orca gets stuck in the air, I chuck a rubber dolphin up into the sky so he can break the imaganery surface.  weird no?<p>A strange cave type thing where there are kronosaurs in the water, you bounce off there noses.<p>past dreams are strange, some in DoTF set up...like an under water lab, coverd in green crud, and you sonar seem to no work...sunken 'putters and shit.<p>older ones are 'drawn' and in my room.<p><br>so canna i make a game? can i dictate and you pice togher?<p>now the important.<br>********************************************<br>spawned from somthing I heard from a kid in school a while back, I<br>started thinking about it more.  Mainly last night in depth.<p>This kid said that KFC was planing on just growing chicken parts, I<br>don't know if this is true or not, but it does sound like a good idea.<br>If scientists can grow human ears on lab rats and harves skin for burn<br>victems, then why not dive deep into the DNA of muscle tissue and see<br>the blue print that tells the orginasim to grow legs, wings, buff legs,<br>ect.  I belive it is possible, with cloning and all.<br>Insted of rasing Cattle, why not "grow" beef, just grow the musscle<br>tissue. so insted of having herds of animals, you just have the meat<br>grown in a lab.  The one downside to this and the only thing standing in<br>the way of this happning is the fact that there will be major job loss,<br>without the need for shepards and cattel ranchers, many will be<br>unemployed.  This gowes the same for fur.  Insed of raising mink, lynx,<br>or fox, just nab the DNA that says "grow fur and skin", and grow fur<br>like grass/sod.  I laugh as I picture this, "do you want to see my mink<br>farm?"  asks person #1 "eh.....sure, but fur is murder and i'm aginst<br>it" replys person #2.  They gointo the 'farm' and see fur grown on wats<br>looks like tables, feet of fur that resembles a sod farm.  "no kill fur"<br>This again, will kill jobs, for those who make the living on raisng fur<br>animals.  Now I have no idea what they do with the meat, i heard on T.V<br>that they use the mink meat for dog food, this may or may not be true. <br>Most likly they use the flesh for fertlizer.  But growing fur will also<br>be good for those who want exiotics, and this way, no endangerd species<br>will be killed.  This brings up another topic.<p><br>Farming flesh without the animals could also help the wild animals.  I<br>heard that the Japanese, over a couple of years wait, are alowed to hunt<br>whales.  now, if they could just grown the flesh in the fashion i<br>mentioned, them there will be no need to harvest endangerd animals.  And<br>as always, there is illegal whaling, or the countires that are allowed<br>to get to, thus lowering population.<p>Growing the parts isn't that bad of an idea, with no orginazims to<br>infect each other, and no steriods to pump into them (we can just<br>aqurier the best of the best genes) we can have 'natural' healthy meat,<br>"No guilt veal and Lamb" and so on.<p>I have e-mailed usda or somthng with this.

Currently as we speak, shots of growth hormone and other gene-enhancing drugs are being put into steer and cows so that they produce bigger meats and more milk.  and what some of the studies rae showing is that the bodies of these steer and cows start to excrete toxic levels of specific hormones and antibodies (associated with some glands) that are making the meat and milk bad. so they have to kil these animlas at a certain timeframe before their body starts doing this <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">   and another thing on the lab growth of meats, would you really want to eat something that has been grown from purely science and not nature?  I don't have that kind of faith in our scientists to get everything right down to the molecule.  consume a few bad molecules (like that of cyanide, or ETbr and your body can be made dysfunctional or even dead.  but i hope someday things will get better for the earth and us.
