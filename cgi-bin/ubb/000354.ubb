Sorry I havent been updating the site, Ive just had some trubble with expage and downloading. I also have a complaint about arkonvioxes "hall of shame" thing (help me out here cresto). Ive put a lot of work into my site and like I said Ive been buisy with school and some other matters I would rather not talk about. Hes been thretening to put my site on there. Come on, this is only my first site and also like I said 7th graders dont get too much free time
