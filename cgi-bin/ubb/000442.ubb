I thought I'd mention some things here about forum battles! One thing is this forums still way to small to be worrying about fighting I've seen much worse in other forums!<p>Hey belucky all you new comers don't have to worry about us old timers "newbie eating" Heck thats what you have to put up else where!!!<p>I wouldnt do that were still a small world here heck were nothing more than a small villadge were not even a world yet! and while else where people own sites that are full universes many of you havent ever yet seen what its like!<p>All I can say is if your hurt about all the bad stuff going on here YOU and ONLY YOU have the power to stop it all. why? because this is a small village where everyones opinions count if you see someone pissed off lay them strait and dont be afraid!<p>Thats all I got to say so all i can say is screw you guys im going home <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

I suggest a Golden Retriever because they are adorable, sweet-natured and pretty easy train.<br>You have to make sure that you are willing to <br>clean messes and stuff like that.<br>If you are really going to get a dog and need tips on house breaking, just ask me.
