A||||6||BigBlu5||The 'Pico' system

Me being an avid gaming fan, I decided to give it a try.  I sat down and was shown the sample games.  When I saw the title 'Ecco JR', I flipped with joy!  A new Ecco game!  I hastily loaded it into the system.  It had a pen control system, and looked like ecco.  Years later, I finally got the genisis Ecco JR.  I was overwhelmed by the huqe differences!  On the pico, you couldn't switch between the characters!  There were no passwords, and the game in itself was totally different!  Whenever you changed levels or something, ecco would swim across the screen, sometimes diving down to pick up a rock or shell, while playing music from Ecco 1.  It was almost like an Ecco JR beta!  <br>*Bigblu5 scratches his melon, trying to remember all of the details...  then remembers that he can't scratch his head, because he has no hands; only flippers, and promptly forgets what he was talking about...  eh.. whoops..*<br>Does anyone have any info. on this system or the version of the Ecco JR game that was on it?<br>Thånx!  -  BigBlu5
