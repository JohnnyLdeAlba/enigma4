In the first one, you use the Power of Sonar to clear the rocks from the entrance to the feeding grounds, and use the Song of the Fish to bring the school of red clown fish to the sick dolphin. He comes out of his "house" when you swim by and thanks you. Sing to his son and he will thank you for saving his father, and then he asks you to follow him. He takes you to the stinging vines, and leads you through them, then teaches you the Song of the Plant.<p>The other way is the way I did it the first time I played. All you have to do is go to the feeding grounds, get the Power of Stealth and swim inside the big fish's mouth! You don't need to bring fish to the sick dolphin in this case, but if you don't, it's possible that the no-shark glitch will happen. I always bring the fish anyway, though, so I haven't seen for myself what happens if you don't bring the fish.

The first time I did it I went through the vines WITHOUT the song of the plant somehow.  I came and the sharks were there though, so maybe going this way the first time helps.
