What are you people crying about shut up! In fact shut the hell up! <p>It's already bad enough we got two online relationships stinkin this room a leader who everyone says is misguided and a group of people creatig there little crappy custom chats to whine how they want to raise the rebeloius flags that say down with blackfin!<p>You know what I was around way before there ever was a stinkin chatroom yeah it used to be dead in fact no one visited it! Heck I didnt visit it unless I knew dragonboy or barbarian would be there which I always ran into drag but never into bar! <p>But let my make things worse by explaining what goes in to those of you who dont we got alot more like people logging owr conversations! about half the rooms filled with ops now who don't know what they op functions do! ( that is operator functions that let you kick people out! ) <p>o what is my message to everyone not to stay out of the chat room hell no! for those of you who dont to tell these little fucks to quit there crying to tell blackfin to keep a smilin and for those idoits who spend there whole days to get a drivin!<p>Screw all of you I'm going home ;P

Once there was happyness and peace in the forum and chatroom, but... people started fighting in the chatroom and now the fighting is starting in the forum....  <IMG SRC="smilie13.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="crying">  Can't we all just get along for a change without everybody shouting at each other...
Z||000003||Debaser13||11-25-2000||06:34 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||There's a simple solution to this, Blackfin : Take the chat room down, or threaten to. It dosen't mean you can't takl to Megs if you take it down -- just find another chatroom to go to. A nice quiet one. And don't tell anyone else where you're going. If people are gonna be jerks, then get rid of the cause. <p>
Z||000004||Coral||11-25-2000||09:26 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Geez! The people here fight like cats and dogs!
Z||000005||PsySonic||11-25-2000||09:46 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <p>This is really all getting out of control. The chat really isn't bad, but only at the times when I'm online. It's nice there. Sure, people make comments on blackfin's and megz' relationship - I got used to it now.<p>But what I see here on the FORUM now - that is getting out of control! Is it because there are so many people here now? When I came here first it was quiet and nice! But since this Forum is full of people and some of them knowing each other from school or other places it is getting out of control! People start fighting each other and it isn't as good as in the good old days of this forum... *sob*<p>I wish people would be more nice and won't post so MUCH here (and so much uninteresting stuff and spam) - it would make this forum much better!

Z||000007||PsySonic||11-25-2000||10:07 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <p>No, I don't say that we should kick people out, cause it actually concerns all of us! If we start kicking people out it won't do us any good - it would only become worse!<p>And it isn't a matter of how long you have been on this forum, it is a matter how you behave on this forum. Some of the new ones on this forum can behave more than other older ones I guess - I GUESS!<p>You are a nice person, Coral - you seem sometimes to want to take the "mother role" and say a mighty sentence like "stop this stupid discussion now", that opens often our eyes and we see what we are actually doing!<p><br>If this situation of the forum doesn't become better in the next weeks I would recommend Blackfin to close it for some days.
Z||000008||blackfin||11-25-2000||03:35 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||As much as I hate this I think I may have to tighted up things, If there is not an improvement I'll have to start deleting and closing posts and possibly even impose temporary bans on some people, I'm considering banning off topic posts, they used to be interesting when the forum was small but now they are just a pain.  I hate forum control but with everybody doing what they want irrespective of the mess it makes I may have little choice.

Well im not gonna have anything to do with this anymore, yer pathetic lives of those who i am pointing this toward do nothing but piss me off!!! I did the pic and soo far everyone liked it but eao and blackfin! Alls i wanted was megzs aproval, but realizing that shes not here, well where does that put me?<br>I dont even like megzs! I did the pic cuz thats my duty out of respect for what other PPL want for them. If they dont like it, i have always bveen more than willing to redo the face pic!<p>As i can remember a while back me and Arkon didnt like Debaeser, but when she asked for a face pic, i decided that i might as well do it. And i did, and i still didnt like Debaeser. But now shes pretty nice and life gos on...
Z||000011||Buddy||11-25-2000||08:07 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Hey! I just noticed! Xoivnokra's name is Arkonviox spelled backwards!
Z||000012||Crestoe||11-25-2000||08:09 PM||crestoe@arkonviox.com||Yup
Z||000013||blackfin||11-25-2000||08:40 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||You make a good point Crestoe, I've been helping a lot of people I didn't paticulary like either.  When I first met Arkonviox I didn't like him that much, but that was changed now.  But in the last few weeks it hasn't just been a few people who have been seriously annoying me it's been more like 20, so my temper is getting a bit short.   I'm sorry for critising megz's face pic Crestoe but I happened to be in a bad mood when I made that post, and I think it is ok, but it's still not your best work, but like I tried (rather badly) before to say was because it is a face pic for megz I am very fussy about it.  But still your reaction to me not liking one single piece of work was excessive...

You still can piss off a lot of ppl, and the ones whop ARE onyer side are not making a difference: i.e. Debaeser claimimng that she had an internet relationship with sumone 2 years ytounger than her is suppoused to be prior to having internet relations with sumone 6 years younger that you if yah know what i mean...<p>Basicly you have been soo neglective to us, yer site, and yer own well bieng over someone who you cannot take care of...<p>What would your parents think?<br>What would her parents think?<p>The thought that comes to mind disgust me, as do the yuppies who think that they know what they're doing...
Z||000015||blackfin||11-25-2000||10:27 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Crestoe, I'm not allowing the fighting to continue, I appolgise for upsetting you, but this fight is ban for us and for the website....  I wish to appolgise please stop fighting

Blackfin if you wanted to let it so she can change the topics just leave the topic to changable!<p>I'm glad psysonic resigned I'd love to do the same but i feel I must keep my power with people like yogoat and a few others I dont trust!<p>Maybe I shouldnt of brought this up eccochick I dont want to start a fight with you cause I don't hate you at all. You actualy one of those I consider my friends but lets face it you dont know the first thing about being an op heck you probably dont know who chanserv is and I think its rediculous that there are prople who are op's just because they want that stupid @ by there name...<p>I'll save this topic for later maybe just give me you guys thoughts I'll give it a week or two and see how it goes if I think that this is still rediculoius I'm gonna make a last stand...<p>I donnot want this to start any flame with those other op's even you eccochick because even though I have this opinion I do not and I mean I do not hate you at all. But when this all started I thought It was a little out of hand I think only blackfins worthy of op status persoanlly as much as id like to say I am too thats very debatable

There are plenty of people who'd probably love to meet you on or offline, if you'd stop whinging and get out there.

I thought the previous incident was an indication of this.  although arkon's little trick of kicking people off chat isn't very amusing.  also it seems that arkon and crest are starting a little too much shit around here.  You two have said enough for awhile.  it seems you keep repeating the same junk over and over again in hopes to keep the disharmony alive.  and especially your other persona as well.  I wonder if you are carrying out one of yopur master plans????  things must calm down here, as coral's absence well illustrates.  its up to all of you to let things rest for awhile, in here and chat.  please <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">

I think that there are a few things that need to be done to stop all of this. The first step is to stop haveing all of these op's in the chat! People wont stop fighting over this! Another thing is for everybody to work on, and that is to stop arguing all the time! Lokk at you people, Fighting over face pics! I talk to cresto, He may not like Megz, but he would never make her Pic bad of perpose! And finaly, we need to have stricter rules. Not a single person has ever been banded (sence ive become a regular here), but I see things all the time that should result in banning. Come on people, lets not ruin this.
