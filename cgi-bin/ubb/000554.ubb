I think it's kewl Eao but my stupid printer ran out of ink half way through printing it so I'll have to wait to get a new ink cartridge to print the other half out GGRRR.

It looks very cool, Eao! Have you cut out each sprite out of your screenshots, or did you switch backgrounds off for your small sprites? 'Cause I know it can get to be hard work to cut out sprites...
Z||000008||Eao||01-05-2001||08:19 AM||collprin@warwick.net||For the main part I just used print screen button.<p>when genecyst worked I took screen shots and earesd every theing around the sprite, in MSpaint.<p>still again..why won't my emu allow me to record .wav and .pcx pics?
Z||000009||PsySonic||01-05-2001||04:16 PM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/psysonic.jpg"> <br>Hmm... I guess that was hard work then, Eao... You can switch off backgrounds by entering the menu "View", then "Layer" and switching off background layers by clicking on "Scrool A High", "Scroll B Low" etc.<p>For your saving problem I still have the feeling that you make something wrong (excuse me if I'm wrong) To check out if you do or not, do the following:<br>Open Genecyst, go to "File" menu and open "Directories..." dialog. There you have to enter in EVERY line a directory that ALREADY EXISTS on your Hard Drive. You won't be able to save them if you enter a directory that doesn't exist!
Z||000010||Eao||01-05-2001||05:13 PM||collprin@warwick.net||yeah.....it said "romand" or somthing, but i think I changed the directory a bit and nothig happned..*trys again*<br>ok it work now.....*praizes the cut and paste*<p>Yeah!  Hey! mabye I'll make "ecco colorforms"<br>or um 'decals"<p>(need special paper)
