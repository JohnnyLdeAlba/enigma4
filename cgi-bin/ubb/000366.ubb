She's not ugly, she's cute!  Our family has had so many dogs, and of all the breds, bulldogs are the best.  I have never seen a breed of dog act so human and loving.  My oldest sister also has a bulldog too, and they love to play outside, especially in the leaf piles or snow.

We get sophie and tubby (sister's bulldog) stuffed animals to play with.  they love toys and playing tug-of-war.  Oh, yeah, these dogs are pigs!  They eat anything and everything.  i hate trying to eat dinner at my parents house and seeing sophie under our glass table staring up at me with those big eyes.  I try ti ignore her, then she puts her head in my lab and whimpers (with tons of drool getting my legs wet).  She knowes I can't resist that, so i give her food.  Oh, and bulldogs heads have the softest fur of any dog, its like pure velvet.  we would like to put her in dog contests, but we decided to neuter her.  many bulldog mothers die from giving birth, that's why bulldog puppies are so expensive ($2000-5000 depending if dog is a champion)  and sometimes the mothers mistakingly kill the babies by rolling on top of them as she sleeps, suffocating them(cuz they're so fat)  so that's why we decided to get her neutered.  wll this is the dog i love the most, i hope the images show up for most of you.

And boy is he ever a people lover. In fact, he loves people a little to much some times. I'll have to get a pic on here. But he may take up the whole screen, he's that big!  <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcharisma.gif">

Some friends of mine have an Old English Bulldog.  I geuss the old english have fewer health problems. Otherwise they woulda' gotten' a regular bulldog.

I love Golden Retrievers. <br>I once saw little bulldog puppies! They were so ADORABLE!! I just wanted to take one home!<br>But we now have 5 dogs! <br>3 of them are ones that we rescued.<br>Ricky is a border colie and golden mix. He is <br>about 4 months old. We rescued him from the animal shelter.<br>Cody is a 10 year old golden. We rescued him from the animal shelter. He is such a sweety but he has bad breath!<br>Charm is a mix breed. We have no idea what she is mixed with. Her owner tied her up outside and left her there most of her life.<br>She mated with another dog out there and had a litter of puppies. The owner didn't care for the dog nor the puppies. He didn't give Charm any food! We rescued her from the animal shelter today and we are trying to find a home for these three dogs!

We had four dogs at once for about 2 years, and it was nuts, and we don't let them live outside.  yeah bulldog puppies are the cutest of any breeds (well they are all cute!)  but with those big triangular ears, chubby jowls, and big eyes, its ahrd not to spoil them with love.  Oh and guess what, i kiss all our animals, except the fish!  a big fat kiss on the nose makes them happy and feel loved.
