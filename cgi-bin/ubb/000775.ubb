You guessed it! It's all because of a fight between me and Arkon...a fight that just blew up completely! And, well, you know how they can get. I wouldn't trust a face pic located at their site though, knowing now just what they'll do out of anger. But, as you can see, I've found a way around it - the face pic thing (which Crestoe drew). But, I don't think I'll be using it here anyway, in the future...for obvious reasons. Crestoe might not want me to...and well, if that's the case...then why the heck would I, when I've got another great one, drawn by Reptyx?! So, I'll probably permanently use that other one from now on. Anyway...on to other things that are more important... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">

You can't make me take that pic off my frickin hard drive, so that, I won't do. You gave me that face pic, and while I won't use it, I can still keep it on my computer if I want to. Besides, it's not like I'm claiming I did it anyway! If I ever use it again, you'll be credited for the work, just like I did in that post up there...so what's the problem?! Or are ya just greedy with the face pics you hand out? You're more than happy to do one for someone, but the fact you drew it, gives you the power to take it away. Hmm, interesting! All you out there with a face pic drawn by Crestoe better watch out then!

You abuse your right as a person and you used to be someone I respected. Then you assaulted myself and my friends. I know you can't repost on this, so Nya. And don't you go and hurt any of my friends, or I will don my Black Hat and your website will never work the same again ^^<p>Have a nice day,<br>Respectfully,<br>KC
Z||000022||blackfin||05-15-2001||06:36 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||um, spiffy no offense but you getting all angry like arkon is hardly going to help, if everybody just gets more and more angry things will just sprial out of control untill something we all regret happens.  I know it's not easy to keep your cool when you are flammed by Arkon but a reaction like that is just asking for more, trust me I know....  Please do everybody and most of all yourself a favour and try to put Arkon out of your mind, just delete his emails without reading them if thats what it takes. Please
Z||000023||SpiffyKidK||05-15-2001||12:00 PM||ambaxter@bulldog.unca.edu||Nah, its not anger. If I was angry I wouldn't have posted that. I'm very good at controlling my emotions.
