A||||6||dragonboy||a new idea for this already magnificent site

This is probably not too possible but i thought I'd throw this idea anyway.

It's nice, but useless in a webpage, it works as a normal program. Hey, and that small program hooks if you play against a friend. Ideal as a irc extra feature.
