Z||000001||dragonboy||09-28-2000||11:02 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||start away from the rings and press the swim buttona feww times to build up speed.  as you're going through the rings, try to aim ecco towrds the surface at a higher angle.  this will take practice, patience, and observation on your part,  good luck.
