Z||000001||dragonboy||11-29-2000||12:35 AM||returner8@hotmail.com||true, but what else can we talk about.  it seems like we exhausted about every question eco that we can until information on the ecco sequel is made available.  its still nice to communicate about whatever else is out there.

Other than that, unless we ask questions on plot or storyline or bugs, yeah. We've pretty much exhasuted (Note : Terrible speller)<p>Besides, off Topic is good. Gets people talking, less arguments (Usually)
