I am going to have a shirt with a dolphin on the left with my name Coral under the picture. Oh, and mom can change the dolphin's colors too! Is anybody interested in a shirt with your name on it or if you want you can just have the word ECCO under the pic?

If you don't know where my e-mail address is on this site it is:<br>ntraver@epix.net<br>Make sure you give me your size too.<br>All the shirts are solid color so tell me the color you want and I'll try and find a sweat shirt of that color.<br>My mom didn't think of a price yet just so you know.
