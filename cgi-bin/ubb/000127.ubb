I just bought Ecco the Dolphin (Mega Drive/ Genesis).<br>I am in the level "Deep Water" and I can find the Asterite (Is it the DNA lookin thing?) but every time I find it it sucks me into it's little room and I can't get out.  And I can't get it to talk to me.  And...... I die of lack of oxygen.  If anyone can tell me what stupid thing I am doing wrong, please enlighten me!  <p>Arquillia Star D*C
