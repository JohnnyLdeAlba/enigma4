In the meantime, the original version is done, spellchecked and betaread at http://members.spree.com/sip/farout34/ecco/index.htm but so far nobody noticed or bothered to mention that the IMG tags at the bottom all read "Foward to Chapter [?]". Grr. I'm not blooming well changing 'em all now...

I should up able to have the first book up here by tomorrow the formating shouldn't take too long and perfect timing, I think the fan fic page needs some work anyway.   I know just how you feel about those img tags GTK, I'm sure there are typos all through the reramped art page but I don't really want to know right now.

Z||000004||GTK||05-25-2001||04:54 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||I've written a few non-fic things, and quite a bit of poetry, but mainly I just write fanfiction. I suppose I'll get around to writing that novel eventually =P But for now, I find more enjoyment in writing for established continuums. If you write a fanfic, you're guaranteed readers after all ^_^<p>Enjoy Tidesinger, people, I worked my arse off finishing it. (Now all I've gotta do is figure out how to start book 2... grumble...) 
Z||000005||blackfin||05-26-2001||09:00 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well book one is a work of art GTK, I hope other fan fic writers take it as a challenge and try to write something better ^_^ and I can't wait to see what you come up with for book two, I know it's going to be awesome ^_^
