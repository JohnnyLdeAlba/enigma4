I'm hunting for them right now, but sadly, most of them seem to be out of print. Ahh well.....<Br> <Br> The Last Whales, Lloyd Abbey. New York: Ballantine/Ivy Books, 1991. <p>From the cover copy: "The oceans have become eerily silent. For the first time in decades there is no sound of men plundering the seas, but neither is there any sound of marine life. Nuclear radiation has turned the waters of planet Earth into a barren wasteland. <br>"Now in this watery graveyard, the last majestic Blue Whales swim through the oceans numbed by shock and despair. Theirs is a final desperate battle against forces over which they have no control as man-made death slowly seeks to annihilate all living creatures.......The Last Whales is a truly remarkable look at the world of the ocean and all of its major denizens . . . Although it is impossible for a human being to view things through the eyes and mind of a whale, Lloyd Abbey has probably come as close as one can get." <Br> <Br> "The Prince of Whales: A Fantasy Adventure (humpback), R. L. Fisher. New York: Carroll & Graf, 1986/New York: Tor Books, 1985. <p>From the back cover: "Young Toby's uncontrollable dream music filled the Arctic night sea with sound that brought great danger to all the whales in Toby's pod. His powerful and thundering music was sure to attract the human hunters with their killing ships and hideous exploding harpoons. For the safety of the pod, Toby had to be banished, exiled to certain, lonely death--unless he could silence his song. <br>But then a strange, ghostly spirit appeared, setting Toby on a quest that led from the depths of the haunted oceans to the mystery of an enslaved, sunken city. A quest in search of his true voice. Somewhere in Toby's song was a secret that reached from the seas to the stars. And only Toby's music could unite all the beings of the land and the water, to save Earth from a dark, evil creature who hated whales, hated humans, hated Nature and, most of all, hated--Dreams." <Br> <Br> Whale, Jeremy Lucas. New York: Summit Books, 1981.. (LH^, orca major character) <p>In this book, the author "brings the reader as close to the experience of another creature as is possible in literature. For in Whale he tells us the story of Sabre, the killer whale, from the moment his parents lift him to the ocean's surface so he can take his first breath, to the day he takes over the leadership of his own pod of whales. It draws us into adventures of courage and endurance alongside creatures of great intelligence, allowing us to witness with startling clarity their savage and wily hunt for food, and the remarkable care and loyalty they show towards one another. It is the story of a perpetual struggle for survival, of the hunter versus the hunted, and of the deadliest hunter of all, man. <br>"In Whale we come to understand the bonds of loyalty and the sources of fear that define the whales' existence. And through [the author's] . . . knowledge of ocean life, his concern for the whale in particular, and his . . . descriptions of the sights and the dramas of the sea, we see in an altogether . . . new way the life of the killer whale." <Br> Interesting stuff, ne? <p><p><br>

The plot involves the future of man, chimps, and dolphins as spacefaring species.<p>Since the dolphins and the humans have a common language, you get a good glimpse into what a dolphin's mind might be like.<p>Amazing book!<p>X-Crispy

I bought the book and have only read it once. If I can find a  really good book JUST about dolphins and whales, maybe in the vein of <i> Watership Down,</i> I'll be happy.

I can't recall the exact tittle but one of them I think it was called the 'dolphineers of pern' or something like that is all about the dolphins..
