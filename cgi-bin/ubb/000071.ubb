A||||0||dragonboy||critique of the dreamcast as a modem
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-09-2000||04:29 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||for those of you who wish to know what its like using the dreamcast as an online machine i will tell you in one word--inefficient.  don't even bother using it to come to the forum unless you have a keyboard because the control, but ler takes forever to punch in the letters and spaces with the onscreen keyboard.  Pages load up with a relatively good speed, but not the best.  The worst thing is that it freezes quite often and some pages show that they are loading but they never do, and thus i have to either reboot the dreamcast or turn it off and then back on again.  Today i went and bought the key board for $10 at a used video game store and its works well. as for mpg's and java script, forget about it, the dreamcast curently can't process  those.  like i mentioned earlier, certain chatrooms won't work on ir. but this suits me fine for now, and the only reason i signed up for seganet is so i can get back $50 since i bought the dreamcast in august and this month is free as a trial subscription.  you can ust tyhe dreamcast o dial into other servers, but it goes slower.  i used my school's server.  well, there you have it.<br>
