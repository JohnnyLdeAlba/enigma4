A||||43||Eao||Idea for our "handles" and RL selves
Z||000000||Eao||10-10-2000||09:03 AM||collprin@warwick.net||ok how a "bio page" thats kinda like the contacts page, but only on our OL selves, example<p>*pic of "us"*<br>Name-Eao<p>Species-Bottle nosed dolphin/morphic Dolphin<p>Apperance- young bottle nosed dolpnin, normal coloration, star shaped scar on forhead from when she was attacked by a starfish at the age of 2 days old<p>apperance for morphic-Bottle Nosed Dolphin, with a human stance, she has a simi thick lengthy tail, with flukes at the end. her chese adorns mock human breasts, these have no purpose, around her neck is a mini metasphere, with this she can change back into a dolphin.  The star is still on her forhead.<p>history/bio-20 years affter the dissaperance of Ecco, Eao was born.  In the Very begining of her life she was swimmin in a shallow coastl waters when she ventured too close to a starfish. The starfish latched onto her head and started attacking her.  Squaking and leaping out of the water to get attenion she struggled to get it off, then help arrived to pull it off.  She was very thankfull to her mother and pod members who saved her, but a horrible scar was left on her head.  If that wasn't enough it is said that is a blood relitive of the great Ecco, who saved the Earth from foes from space, reunited dolphin pods and helped the Asterite.  She loved to hear the songs of Ecco, the sad fact that he dissipered was a heavy burden on her heart, so when she got old enough she set off to rescue him...but this journey won't be an easy one.<p>---------------------------------------------<p>mabye we can make a "dolphin Code" with letters and symbols that will stand for somthing example<p>BN, would be Bottle Nosed<br>AS, would be Alantic Spotted<br>Or, would be for orca<br>Spn, for Spinner<br>Nw- for Narwal<br>Bl-bluga<p>ect<p>and colors<p>Gr-grey<br>ect ect<p>:for light version<br>; for dark<br>* molted<p><br>we can all help, this can be a collective thing.

Z||000002||Coral||10-10-2000||03:48 PM||ntraver@epix.net||That sounds cool, Eao! Here's mine:<p>  <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif"> <br>Name: Coral<br>Species: Spotted Dolphin<br>Apperance: Young female spotted dolphin. Around 4 years old. White shining star on her <br>head.<br>History/bio: Coral is a dolphin destined to be a hero and help Ecco save the world along with other chosen ones. The star on her head represents 1 of the 5 stars on Ecco's head. When all the destined dolphins unite, they can summon the Power of the Stars. Coral lives and guards the Sacred Coral Reef. Within this coral reef there is the Power to Transform which Coral protects.<p>What do you think? I like this idea!
Z||000003||Bloodfin||10-10-2000||04:23 PM||tassonyi_bloodfist@teamartail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbloodfin.gif">  A website that i go to often has that feature, its cool. Though its alot of work, it would be a replacement of a contacts page. But it does sound complicated, an example is:<p>Name: Bloodfin Tamalowa<p>Species: Clan: Bottle nosed dolphin<p>Appearance: Red body,Spikes along both sides of back. Spikes on fins and tail. Lower body black along belly.Age unknown.<p>History/Bio: Serves under the control of mutaclone. Along side ecco, they would search out the dolphins not of the clan for slauter. (In my comic im making)<p>I like the idea too, but you have to understand that blackfins doing many other projects. And wether he uses this idea or not, it will be a while B4 he has it up.
Z||000004||Coral||10-10-2000||04:37 PM||ntraver@epix.net||  <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Yeah I know, Bloodfin. Blackfin is probably under enough stress already. I was just saying that it was a cool idea.
Z||000005||Buddy||10-10-2000||06:15 PM||ntraver@epix.net||I just feel like putting my dolphin profile in here:<br> <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbuddy.gif">  <br>Name: Buddy<br>Species: Spinner Dolphin<br>Apperance: A 3 year old male spinner dolphin.<br>Very muscular and tough. Long nose and lots of small teeth.<br>History/bio: Is Ecco's spy when it comes to gathering info from earth's attackers. He gathers info about where the aliens are going to attack next or where they are going to search for the chosen ones. As Coral's best friend, he also helps protect the Sacred Coral<br>Reef.<br>This is cool!
Z||000006||Bloodfin||10-10-2000||08:22 PM||tassonyi_bloodfist@teamartail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbloodfin.gif">  I like your hitory/bio, is that apart of your game? I like it!
Z||000007||Bloodfin||10-10-2000||08:28 PM||tassonyi_bloodfist@teamartail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbloodfin.gif">  Damn it! Umm...would you like to hear the prologue of "Earth Clan" that im writting? I have no pics from it as of yet but i have written a small overview, And as muchas Arkonviox doesnt want me to say anything about it cuz he wanted to make the site for it first (which looks bleak now) But its good...
Z||000008||Coral||10-10-2000||08:30 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Yes, it is part of our game. I'm glad you like it. When I get the chance to go to my dad's house, he'll show me how to program stuff. If you want to know how program stuff, I'll try and note everything he says for ya.
Z||000009||Buddy||10-10-2000||08:34 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbuddy.gif">  Bloodfin, you don't have to tell us if you don't want to and besides I don't even know what the clan is because I didn't get that far in the game.
Z||000010||blackfin||10-11-2000||01:10 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've done some thinking since I did my intial post on this thread and I think I could out up a page like that as an upgrade of the contacts page in prehaps a few days if I'm not too busy, I'll look into it.
Z||000011||Bloodfin||10-11-2000||02:53 AM||tassonyi_bloodfist@teamartail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbloodfin.gif">  Tha'd be cool blackfin! I can finally get a chance to update my contacts as 'Bloodfin' Instead of the old 'Darkfin' name that i used to have! I also decidede not to ever change my name except for when i not in here. IN other sites i go by the names of: Tassonyi bloodfist (Teamartail.com), Stan (Eminem.com), and on this site, my full name is Bloodfin Tamolowa (The intire name) So im thru with name changes and happy to have made up my mind!<p>Hey Buddy, i wuz goinna tell you anyways, i want my upcoming comic to be good. It links from DOFT, i'll add a pic that i drew of the clan dolphin.<p>Oh and coral, i think i'll just listen to anything yer dad tells you that i could eves drop on, i pick up usefull things from my brother when hes not blabbing about himself. <p>BTW, what do you think of Arkonviox's face pic?  <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/farkonviox.gif">  Oh, and for those of you who dont know, the 'f' by yer names stand for face! For example: fcoral.gif would stand for Face coral, i thought i'd bring that up cuz some person thought i ment...Well the 'F' word. The idiot....
Z||000012||blackfin||10-11-2000||04:10 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've just done some thinking and I have some new ideas for implementing the new contacts page, but these will delay things for a while. 
Z||000013||Ecco The Dolphin||10-11-2000||07:04 PM||eccodolphin@hotmail.com||Sounds like an idea that could work, if Blackfin has time to work it in.<br>There are codes like it, and it makes it so that we know that each of us is "in".<br>Name:  Ecco<br>Species:  Bottlenose Dolphin<br>Appearance:  A solid gray dolphin with five stars representing the constellation Delphinus upon his forehead.<br>History/bio:  Ecco saved the world from the Vortex twice and became the stone that split the stream of time.  After his second defeat of the Vortex he used the time machine of the Atlanteans to swim into the Tides of Time.  This act confused all, and he hasn't been heard from since....
Z||000014||Coral||10-11-2000||08:28 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  I'm going to tell you 2 profiles of the characters in my game:<p>Name:Kinko<br>Species: Bottle-nosed dolphin<br>Apperence: A 1 year old dolphin. Very playful and likes to jump out of water alot.<br>History/bio: Is Ecco's friend and loves to hang out with him. Kinko respects and looks up to Ecco like Ecco is his father. Kinko always tags along with Ecco even on dangerous adventures<p>Name:Kitnee<br>Species: Orca<br>Apperance: A male 7 year old killer whale. Very large and has a big dorsal fin. Has a small white star on his head.<br>History/bio: Don't let his name fool you. He is one rough and tough fighter. He is 1 of the five chosen ones. He lives with a normal pod and normal family, but he is being hunted like the rest of the chosen dolphins by aliens.<p>I love doing this. This profile stuff is fun!
Z||000015||That guy with the hat||10-12-2000||06:24 PM||||Okay I don't have a picture ready, but I'll give it a shot anyway. Ahem...<p>Name: That guy with the hat<p>Species:Mobian Echidna<p>Appearance: A green upright echidna who always wears a hat. Usually with a T-shirt, sweat pants, and sneakers.<p>History/bio: Just your ordinary average guy. He has nothing to do with Ecco except he likes the games. He's actually a character for the Sonic universes, but thats not currently the point. He has always loved Sega stuff and considers Nintendo and Sony to be hated enemies. His older brother got a Genesis and Sonic the hedgehog one Christmas and video games have kinda' been his "thing" ever since. He also has a Sega Saturn, Game Gear and got a Dreamcast the day it arrived in America. He hopes to be a video  game designer type guy and comic book artist. He is often quite humorous. Some other times he can be quite frank.

Her real name is long- forgotten.......or is it ? <Br> Species : Bottle-nosed dolphin <Br> Appearance : Young female whom looks a bit like Silverfin's pic backwards : That is, she is black with a silver mask and green eyes, a rarity in dolphins. Has a mark on her head in silver that vaguely resembles a pheonix. Silver fins and flukes. <Br> <Br> History/Bio : When The Outlander was born, she was thought to be a bad sign by the Pod Elders because of her coloration, and throughout her young life was sorely mistreated by the rest of the dolphins, who through narrow-mindedness thought she was a freak.<Br> <Br> When she was a bit older, the Outlander was banished from her home pod, because of an incident with fishing nets which was believed to come about because of her and the bad luck she was thought to possess. From then on she did not use her old name, and was simply known as "The Outlander". <Br> <Br> Barely able to survive on her own, with nowhere to go, she grew up fast. And soon she soon felt a pull driving her south.......like someone was calling. Thus began a long journey that ended with her being given the role of guardian of the Library of Ruined Atlantis by the great and wise entity, the Asterite. Which was where she met Ecco.......<Br> <Br>....And if I say anymore it'll spoil the twisted fic I'm working on. If anyone knows what I mean by a "twisted" fanfic.....

When the time vortex opened, A helpless Mutaclone watched as a small youth dolphin leave to his present. Though Ecco had defeated Mutaclone, He had not killed the real Mutaclone. In cognito, Mutaclone watched Ecco destroy a meere clone. As the time gate closed, a currious Mutaclone followed.<p>He found that the foe had returned, he had destroyed the foe and the humans, but without the clan, the foe was able to take over earth. <p>As Ecco fought the queen, The Mutaclone traveled to Atlantis. Dolphins swam freely, Ecco had destroyed the foe and atlast could swim in peace. Mutaclone angered at the sight of a fellowship dolphins had created with humans. He left and set out to find a way to restore earth to his original likings.<p>In a shallow part of the sea, he found the remains of a ship belonging to the foe. A small damaged peace that had originally stole the traits from the dolphins. And using his supperior intelligence, he recreatyed it. And with his last hope of saving his original present, he activated the machine.<p>Once again, Earth suffered a new change...<p>He took away ambition and wisdom from the dolphins. They became more powerful than before And Atlantis became the lair of Mutaclone. All the dolphins had changed....including Ecco...<p>When humans and dolphins returned to Earth, The Clan raged a war with the humans. Using their new found powers, they traveled out of water and flew above the land, attacking cities, and bringing fire to our streets, and our forest, Islands, they untill they ahd devowered, and slaughtered the humans.<p>The dolphins who had traveled with the humans were not affected by the other dolphins, and were forced to go into hiding.<p>The other were not soo lucky, they became slaves of their own race!<p>They became the Crimson, The Movers, and The Circle. As two worlds colided. Mutaclone ruled an entire planet. With this done, soon he would be able to fofill his plan...<p>The Clan would soon be powerfull enough to travel out of water to seek conquest in space.

Z||000035||That guy with the hat||10-14-2000||08:45 PM||||Hey Bloodfin that prolouge looks great! There are just a few things I disagree with. I don't think the Clan really killed all the humans I think they just "drove them from the seas"(though humans might have died out all worrying themselves crazy what dolphins could be plotting against them). And also, you say that without the Clan, the Foe was able to conquer earth, but the Clan isn't the only one truly capable of that. For instance humans destroyed the foe in Man's Nightmare(at the cost of their lives, but just the same) and humans & dolphins kept the foe out for a long time in the regular future. I don't think Domain of the Enemy is the regular future I think its actually a third bad future(not that you necessarally thought it was, but either way). So any way that's just what I thought.

So they needed to create...a super human that's poisonous.  But, no crazy mofo would eat anything served in front of him, so they combined Strawberry yogurt with milk from his mom--a goat.  The, through years of genetic splicing, they created the ultimate being...YOGOAT.  He traveled to Iraq, and took the form of a U.S. Embassador, therefore gaining the right to meet Sadam.  When the doors were locked, he showed his true form.  The guards shot thousands of bullets at him, but they just got stuck in his thick, gutless body.  He grabbed Sadam by his collar, and shoved an arm into his esophogus.  Then he cut his arm off, and let Sadam choke down the poisonous, tasty treat.  Yogoat then exited the building as a guard, and has been cherished ever since.  He is also the master of the world, and yet many people don't know it, is Mutaclone's master =)<p>WHOOO!!
