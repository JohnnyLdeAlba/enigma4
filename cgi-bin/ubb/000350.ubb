Z||000000||dragonboy||11-02-2000||12:59 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||anyone see the new simpson's halloween special.  it was a more stupid than usual ( and not scary at all).  but what bothered me was the last clip.  it was of dolphins taking over springfield and killing people.  what stupid nonsense.  i hope this episode doesn't hurt people's image of dolphins.  it probably won't, but i was kind of upset.  i guess i took this a little personally.  it's like insulting a member of my family.  well that's what i thought.

This evolved as a survival trait, in the same way as a human's hand and eye co-ordination, a chameleons's camouflage and a dolphin's renowned ability to save drowning swimmers if there's any chance that biting them in half might be observed and commented upon adversely by other humans.<p>--Terry Pratchett, Pyramids</I>

Z||000014||dragonboy||11-04-2000||10:24 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||I know all, i just like these mammals of the sea so much, i just don'y like them appearing negative in any form.  i am well-versed in all the bad behaviors that dolphins actually do exhibit, so i realize they are not a  perfect being, and that's ok.  after all, are humans perfect?  hell no!   i saw that horny dolphin eao's talking about.  and interestingly, enough i have learned of a great many other times that dolphins decide to show there "affections" towards humans, not always with the best consequences.  Everything is not entirely known about a dolphins sexual activity, but like humans, it is much more than just a simple desire to procreate.  dolphins spend about 75% of their time engaged in some form of sexual activity with each other.  It seems they use sex as a way of strengthing the relational bonds among each other.  and most of these observed acts are between two or more male dolphins.  I have more info on stuff like this which i will put in another post sometime.

Z||000016||The Entity||11-07-2000||06:40 PM||boblamont@mac.com||Technically, most bees would be lesbians, since the word "gay" only applies to males and almost all honeybees are female.
