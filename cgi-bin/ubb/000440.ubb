And his mask was hot. And if his comrade started talking about his family back home one more time, Kerrison <br>swore to himself, he would personally shoot the annoying bastard. <p>The life of a Esthar soldier was not easy, especially not when every mission they took as of late led them straight into the <br>boondocks. When Kerrison had signed up to be a soldier, a fresh-faced boy of twenty, his immediate thoughts had been of <br>all the new places he'd see. Being stuck in Esthar, as appealing as it seemed to some, was not his idea of a life, and the youth <br>had looked foreward to seeing the wide world outside the boundaries of the advanced metropolis he had been raised in. <p>But so far all he'd seen was the inside of his mask and a whole lot of backcountry. <p>"So, Lance, you know where we're being assigned yet?" he'd asked one of his higher ranking friends eagerly a few weeks <br>before. "Dollet? Galbaldia?" <p>The older soldier turned to him with a half-amused/ half-disgusted expression. <p>"Nope. Winhill." <p>A look of confusion passed over Kerrison's face. "Huh?" <p>Lance grinned at him. "Some backwater village in the middle of nowhere. The order came directly from the witch; I sure as hell <br>ain't arguing with her." <p>Kerrison had shuddered at the thought of Adel. He'd only seen the Sorceress once, but it had been enough. He had to wonder <br>at the term "sorceress" though; he had his doubts she was a woman. Hell, he didn't know if she was HUMAN. "I guess we're <br>stuck then" he sighed, trying to keep cheerful. No village could be THAT remote; for the boy raised in the heart of Esthar his <br>entire life no buildings towering around him was an impossible thing to imagine. <p>But here he was, in the middle of nowhere, trudging through what had to be the most godforsaken place on earth, at least to <br>him. And there wasn't a skyscraper or car in sight. And it was driving him NUTS. The only thing you could hear was the sound <br>of your own feet crunching through the grass and gravel of the plains, the occasional seabird, and crickets. So many damn <br>crickets. <p>"I wonder if you can shoot crickets" he thought morosely, kicking at a stick in the path. <p>*Isn't this great?" bubbled the soldier directly behind him in line "I'll bet you could walk miles and miles and never hit an outpost! <br>And listen to that silence. You'd never hear it this quiet in Esthar, that's for sure!" The soldier took a deep breath and Kerrison <br>justknewhe must be beaming beneath his mask. Stupid bastard. Anyone that happy after a 27 mile hike through the <br>outback was either not too bright or had a serious mental deficency. Or both. Kerrison gritted his teeth and kept on walking, <br>resisting the urge to scream bloody murder at his hapless comrade. <p>It didn't help that they'd been on an airship for the past 5 hours before landing on this continent and setting out to hike <br>the 35 miles to Winhill. The excuse for just not flying there was the Esthar forces wanted an element of suprise, and hovering <br>the largest ship in the fleet over the tiny town would have told even the dimmest residents that something was amiss. But <br>Kerrison could care less about suprise; he had been sick on the way over, and the last thing he felt like doing was hiking. <p>The line of soldiers passed a chocobo carcass; victim of old age or some predator that had eaten its fill and moved on. From <br>the looks of things it couldn't have been that long ago, but the smell........the heat had done its magic. <p>Kerrison felt himself gag at the stench, and desperately tried to hold his breath. It didn't work; the smell crept into his nose <br>like it had a purpose. He couldn't hold out. Ripping his mask off, he turned to retch.......... <p>...........All over Mr.Happy behind him. <p>"Let's see you say something nice about that " Kerrison thought sardonically. <p>************** <p>5 hours later the troop had set up camp in a rocky canyon about halfway to their destination. Mr. Happy thankfully hadn't said <br>a word since Kerrison annointed him with the contents of his stomach, and the rest of the hike had gone uneventfully. <p>Kerrison had never been so happy to hear the order to halt in his life. He had never been a big walker back in Esthar, <br>relying on an incredibly fast metabolism to keep him rail thin, and even the training he'd received in the army hadn't prepared <br>him for this. "Just one little scyscraper" he thought wearily, blinking at the land through a haze of salty sweat and exhaustion. <br>"One little car.If I could just see something that would tell me the rest of humanity isn't freaking dead, I'd be thrilled." <br>Taking off his mask with a sigh of relief, he flopped down onto the ground and stared at the sky, not really seeing the <br>setting sun turn the clouds left in the sky mauve and peach and a thousand shades of orange. What the hell did he care <br>about the sky? It wasn't gonna give him a bath and make him feel better. <p>An hour later he remembered that thought and just knew some higher lifeform was out to get him as he crouched, <br>soaking, in his tent. A peal of thunder rolled out, which seemed to make the rain fall heavier. Not that it bothered Kerrison, oh <br>no. He was already so wet that he couldn't be more soaked if he jumped in the Great Salt Lake. Cursing the sky, the higher-ups <br>of the Esthar government, Adel, and anything else that popped into his mind, he turned over on his pallet and tried to get to <br>sleep, shivering like all the other soldiers. The day's heat had turned to bitter chill with the night and the thunderstorm, and the <br>entire mass of people seemed to be shivering at once. <p>Still, Kerrison was exhausted, and he could already feel himself slipping into sweet oblivion. He was on the edge of dreamland <br>when the sound of singing startled him out of his daze. Jesus CHRIST, who was singing at this hour ?! <p>Kerrison rolled over to glare at the culprit and found himself face to face with a fast asleep, loudly warbling Mr.Happy. <p>*** <p>The next day started out better than the last, but Kerrison was still a bit wary. To some, the morning would have been <br>considered beautiful. The thunderstorm had left droplets of water on every grassblade, and they flashed colorfully under the <br>sun's rays. As usual, he could care less. All it meant to the youthful soldier was that he couldn't get his uniform dry before <br>putting it on, and with Esthar's strange suits, this was especially annoying. "Whoever designed skin-tight uniforms for this <br>army should have his head bashed in with a rifle butt." Kerrison muttered to himself, glaring at the cheerfully humming Mr. <br>Happy, who's real name he had found out was Eric. <p>Eric had flaming red hair, a baby face, and was unerringly cheerful. He didn't even hold Kerrison's vomiting all over his uniform <br>against him, much to Kerrison's chagrin. In fact, Eric seemed to like him. And god, that was the last thing he wanted. <br>"I hope we get to hike more; I can't wait to see more of this place. Everything looks so cool, it's like a nature documentry <br>or something." Eric chattered, shaking droplets off his gun-scythe. Kerrison sighed and wished with all his might that this day <br>would be mercifully short and with a minimum of Eric-chatter in it. <p>And thankfully it was. A few hours of walking and the land began to change slightly, the rough sage and gravel changing over to <br>green grass and reddish canyons. The temperature became cooler, a welcome reposite from the heat of the higher plains. <br>But there still wern't any signs of civilization, which continued to unnerve Kerrison to no end. <br>The order to halt came a suprisingly short time later. The squad leader announced that this was as close to their destination <br>as they would go in a body and gave them their orders, speaking in a terse, short manner through his mantis-like helmet. <p>"You will split up and surround the town. You will search the village and the area and find the girl Ellone Leonhart. When you <br>find her you will bring her back to this camp immediately. Do NOT harm her, or you'll have the Sorceress Adel to <br>answer to. However, if anyone gets in the way of your objective, you will terminate them immediately. Understood?" <p>Twenty-five blue masks nodded as one. <p>"Good. Now move out!" The leader dismissed them with a wave of his gun-scythe and the group split up into twos and threes, <br>moving in the general direction of the small village. Kerrison was preparing to do the same when someone tapped at his <br>shoulder. <p>Eric was standing next to him. And if Kerrison's guess was correct, he was beaming like an idiot under that mask. <p>"So, which way do we go?" he asked with his typical cheerfulness. Kerrison rolled his eyes and sighed. He was stuck <br>with this guy, whether he liked it or not. "Well, I'd guess we go search the town and find the girl, wouldn't you think?" <br>The reply came out sharper than he'd meant it to, and he instantly felt a little guilty. After all, wasn't Eric's fault he couldn't <br>stand overly cheerful people. But it didn't seem to phase his mood a bit. <p>"Guess you're right" Eric replied, pointing his gun-scythe at an imaginary foe. "Let's go find that girl!!" <p>"Jesus god, let us find that girl before I kill him" Kerrison mumbled, briefly removing his helmet to run a hand through <br>his long black hair in exasperation. If he had thought that the hike would be the end of his pains, he had been sadly mistaken. <p>******* <br>The village was quiet when the two soldiers approached, following the dirt path that led into the center of town. "Not even a <br>paved road." Kerrison lamented, looking irritably at the fine layer of dust that was now covering his shiny black boots. "I wonder <br>if they even have electricity." <br>"Great, isn't it?" Eric chimed in "It looks just like a storybook place, or an old west town. Wish I had been born somewhere like <br>this" he continued wistfully, "....But my dad was in the army too. Wanted me to do the same, so here I am." As almost an <br>afterthought he added "I have to be a good soldier. If I don't, he'll hate me when I come back. I just know it." <p>Kerrison blinked. He hadn't known there was such a sad side to the happy-go-lucky soldier who'd been dogging him the entire <br>trip. He almost felt sorry for the guy. Almost. <p>Knowing the town wouldn't be quiet for long once the rest of the soldiers showed up, Kerrison and Eric split up, agreeing to <br>meet back at the entrance in two hours, more than enough time to give the tiny town a fast once over before the rest of the <br>squad arrived. Eric was to check inside all buildings, while Kerrison had the unlucky task of searching the outside perimeter. <br>He would've rather stayed indoors, as primitive as the stores and houses looked, but they'd flipped a coin and as usual, <br>Kerrison's luck had promptly took a swan dive. <br>So scouting he went. He followed the long dirt path through a small cluster of houses and to a small crossroads. There seemed <br>to be quite a few voices coming from the left fork, so he went right and hoped that for once his luck wouldn't fail. The <br>path wound around a small lakeside cliff, through a small grove of trees, and ended in a small circle of houses, the center of <br>the town. And there, peering out from over the bank of the hill, Kerrison saw what he was looking for. <p>The town square was composed of a circular cobblestoned area, surrounded by various houses and shops. Here and there <br>some of the stones were painted various colours, so when seen as a whole, it looked as if a gigantic bud had opened it's petals <br>in the middle of the courtyard. "Very pretty, but it still didn't hide the fact that this place is a dump" Kerrison muttered. But the <br>flower pattern wasn't what had attracted his attention. <p>On the outer fringes of the square, idly playing hopscotch with her shadow, was a little girl of about 5. Her dark hair fell over <br>her eyes, and she wore a blue dress, neatly starched and spotlessly clean. Seeing no adults about, Kerrison stepped out of <br>the alleyway and approached her carefully, taking off his mask so he wouldn't scare the child. <p>She looked up as his shadow fell over hers and gave him a cheerful smile. "Hewwo there! Do you wike to play hopstoch too?" <br>She gave another small hop, skip, and jump, plotting her steps carefully. <p>Kerrison smiled and tried to look friendly, kneeling until he was at eye-level with the little girl. "No, I've never played before, <br>I'm afraid." <p>She stopped her game and turned to look at him, a puzzled expression crossing over her face. "Never?" <p>The soldier shook his head and gave her a sad smile. "Nope. I'm too old for that now, you see." <p>The little girl nodded, seeming to consider this. "Well.....you could pway with me, if you wanted." She gave him another winning <br>smile and patted him on the arm as if to console him for his loss. <p>Kerrison gave her a weak smile back. "What's your name, anyway?" he asked, even though he had a feeling he already knew. <p>"Ewwone." <p>The young soldier nodded. This was the one, alright. He had been sent here to take the girl, but now that he was faced with the <br>actual deed, he had no earthly idea of how to go about it. He didn't want to scare her...... <p>"That's a very pretty name" he said, trying to keep the girl's innocent trust in him steady. The child beamed at him; evidentally <br>his compliment had worked. <p>"What's your nawme?" she queried, still looking straight into his eyes with her own dark hazel ones. Kerrison inwardly <br>groaned; he hadn't wanted to get entangled in this personally, but he guessed giving his name to her wouldn't hurt. <p>"Kerrison." <p>The girl squinted and said it to herself. "Kewwison. That's nice" she stated, looking away to watch a bird wheel overhead. "I <br>have a uncle named Waguna, you know" she confided seriously to him. <p>This reminded him of something, and he used her moment's silence to ask another question. "Where are your parents? Aren't <br>there more adults around here?" <p>The girl shook her head seriously. "Waine and Waguna are hewping pick fwowers. I'm supposed to stay hewe and be good." So <br>that's where they all were. The Esthar troops had come right in the middle of the only thing Winhill was famous for : <br>Its flower festival. That would make taking the girl easy; maybe noone would even get shot. Kerrison didn't think he could <br>shoot someone in cold blood, even if their town WAS rural hell. <p>But how could he lure the girl out of town and back to camp without scaring her or causing a scene? He had to think fast. <p>"Ellone?" The little girl turned from her skygazing and looked back at the soldier. "How would you like to come with me and see the <br>chicobo I'm raising? It's just hatched, and I need a little girl to look after it. Whaddaya say, hmmm?" <p>Classic kidnapper line. Kerrison had been taught early on as a child in the city not to go with anyone, no matter what they had at the other <br>end of the bargin, but, as he had hoped, Ellone had been taught no such thing. Her eyes lit up like Christmas-tree lights. <p>"Owww yes pweese!!" she said, jumping up and down and latching onto the young soldier's hand. It startled the hell out of him, and he <br>was tempted to shake her off, but something stopped him. Something about the trusting little face looking up at him so adoringly made him <br>smile, not a fake smile created to insinuate himself into the girl's good graces, but a real, heartfelt grin. <p>The smile faded when he remembered what he had been sent to do, however. He couldn't get attached, couldn't let himself get involved. <br>The kid was a prisoner, or was going to be, and there was no telling what they'd do with her once she was brought back to Esthar. That <br>creepy witch was the one who sent out the order; he was sure she didn't just want to tell the little girl fairy tales. Hardening himself to his <br>task, Kerrison turned back to the waiting Ellone, who was by this time almost dancing on the cobblestones with impatience. <p>"Ready to go?" he asked, knowing full well the answer, but wanting to forestall his fall from grace with the child and the guilt that was <br>already creeping up on him like the shadow of a tall building. <p>A vigorous nodding of the head and a mighty tug at his hand were the responses. He couldn't help but smile. <p>*********** <p>Kerrison wished he could be as cheerful about this endeavor as Ellone was; she was here, there, and everywhere. Chasing a butterfly there, <br>pointing and laughing at anything that caught her eye, she was the picture of a happy, innocent little girl. She never got too far away from <br>him, however, and was always turning to smile at what she thought was a new best friend. And the farther they went, the guiltier Kerrison <br>got. He hadn't signed up in the army to kidnap little kids; he'd just wanted to get out of Esthar. <p>This wasn't in the job description he thought. I was supposed to be in a Dollet bar by now. <p>The odd pair soon came out of the path and into a wide field on the outskirts of Winhill. Trees encircled the meadow, which was positively <br>covered with wild lillies. Ellone squealed with pleasure at the sight of so many "pwetty fwowers" and ran to pick one. Then, <br>carefully cupping the bud in her palm, she turned and handed it to Kerrison. <p>"This is fwor you." she said with a smile. "Isn't it pwetty?" <p>Something about the little girl giving him a flower, and the proud way she had presented it to him, made Kerrison's mind kick <br>into high gear. Old memories, locked away and painful, came back to him, and he had to steady himself for a moment before he could <br>look at Ellone again. When he did, it wasn't her face he saw, but another little girl, in another place far away............. <p><p>He had been 9 when it happened, a young, scruffy boy living amongst the skyscrapers and shining glass of Esther. His father had left <br>them when he was 5, and upon his small shoulders had been set the responsiblity of looking after his little sister, Meg. She <br>was 4 years younger than him, and adored her big brother more than anyone else on the planet. The feeling was mutual; he loved the little <br>girl greatly and always watched closely over her, buying her toys and nice things with what little money he made selling flyers for the <br>various item and weapon stores in the Esthar Mall. <p>His mother tried to take care of them, but being on her own with two children to feed was more than the poor woman could handle. So <br>maybe it was a blessing what happened next, although neither Kerrison or his mother thought so. Especially not Kerrison. It would haunt <br>his dreams in the years to come. <p>He'd come home to the small, middle-income house he shared with his mother and sister, a shining red lilly clutched tightly in his hand. <br>Flowers were expensive and hard to come by in Esthar, but he'd worked especially hard to buy this one for his little sister. She loved <br>flowers, and he always made a point to bring her one or two a week if he possibly could. <p>The door had been wide open when he got there, the first indication that something was wrong. <p>"Mom?" he called out, peering into the darkened house "Meg? I'm home!" <p>No answer but the sound of weeping from within. He felt a chill go up his spine; something was definitely wrong. Usually Meg tackled <br>him at the door, but today she was nowhere to be seen. And why was his mother crying? <p>"Mom?" he called, a note of fear creeping into his voice "What's wrong? Where's Meg?" <p>"She's gone, dear. A man came by today........they're taking all the girls her age to the witch. There was nothing I could do; he had papers <br>and......I'm so sorry....I couldn't stop...." <p>The sobbing resumed, but Kerrison wasn't there to hear it. He was running down the darkening street, yelling his sister's name, looking <br>for her. She couldn't be gone, she just couldn't.....why would they take HER? Why? Why would they take the only thing that mattered in <br>his life? <p>Why? <p>The lillie lay discarded and forgotten on the doorstep, already beginning to wilt from the cold. <p>***** <p>He came back to the present with a start. Ellone was glaring at him impatiently and tugging at his hand, obviously ready to see the <br>"chicobo" he had promised. Kerrison looked down at the childish face, so like his sister's, and realized what he had to do. No, for Ellone's <br>sake, for the memory of his sister, he would not turn this little girl over into greedy hands that wanted her for purposes he could only <br>guess at. Screw being a soldier. He'd get out of Esthar some other way, and not at the price of his concience. <p>But there was one little problem : the rest of his squad. They were scouring the countryside for her, and if he got caught helping her out, <br>they were both dead meat. As if in response to his thoughts, over the far horizon a silohette appeared, making it's way <br>casually down the slope towards them. The figure walked into a dip in the hill and dissapeared from view for a few moments, and Kerrison <br>knew he had to use those few seconds to his advantage if he wanted to keep the child out of Adel's hands. <p>"Ellone?" The little girl turned and looked at him, the tinest spark of fear beginning to show in her eyes as she realized that he <br>didn't have a chicobo to show her. "We're gonna play a little game of hide and seek. You see those trees over there?" <p>She nodded, still being uncharacteristically quiet, as if she could sense the urgency in his voice <p>"When I say, I want you to run over and hide in those trees. And hide yourself well, 'cause I'm going to come look for you in a <br>second, and I don't want to find you, O.K?" <p>She smiled at him, the idea of another game wiping all doubt from her face. "Owkay!!" As she turned to run for the trees, the <br>soldier came into view, and as Kerrison saw him, he saw Kerrison. With a shout he came running down the hill, arms and <br>gun-scythe flailing like a windmill. Kerrison realized with a sinking heart that, unless he took drastic measures, there was no <br>way he would be able to save the little girl. Kerrison put a restraining hand on the girl's shoulder and stood stock still as <br>the masked figure approached. <p>"Kerrison, what are you doing?! You were supposed to show up at the gate half an hour ago!!" <p>He couldn't believe who it was when he heard the voice. Eric. He had forgotten all about meeting the cheerful soldier at the <br>entrance to town, but it all came flooding back clearly now. <p>"Is that the little girl? You already found her? Great!" <p>The other soldier answered his own questions with his customary aplomb and reached for the girl's arm. Ellone's eyes <br>widened, and she turned a pleading stare to Kerrison. It clearly said "Don't let this guy touch me. Please." <p>Kerrison reacted without really even thinking. He reached out and pushed Eric away, pulling the girl behind him as he did so. <p>Eric blinked, as if maybe he had misunderstood something, and doggedly reached for her again, only to be pushed away once <br>more by the stolid Kerrison. This time Eric got mad, the first time Kerrison had ever seen him annoyed the entire trip. "Man, <br>why the hell do you keep pushing me away? Let me take care of the girl and let's get outta here!!" <p>Kerrison took a deep breath and shook his head. <p>"We're not taking her back." <p>Eric gave him a look like he'd just sprouted another 5 heads. "Have you gone INSANE?! They'll kick us out of the army for that <br>kind of insubordination, or worse! My dad would KILL me if I got kicked out....." <p>His protests trailed off into nothing and the two soldiers stood silently, looking at each other. Kerrison spoke again, a <br>dangerous note entering his voice this time. <p>"I'm not letting them take her back to god knows what with that witch, so either help me, or get out of the way." <p>Eric said nothing, but didn't make a move to reach for the girl again. He just stood watching the two as Kerrison turned and <br>prepared to send the child to the woods. As Kerrison opened his mouth to speak to Ellone again, he heard a tiny click from <br>behind. He turned.......And found Eric pointing his gun-scythe directly at his chest. He blinked incrediously and looked from <br>the gun barrel to Eric's face and back again. Now it was Kerrison's turn to be suprised. <p>"Eric.....no, come on man, don't do this" he pleaded frantically, backing away from the barrel wobbling dangerously in the <br>direction of his chest. Eric didn't say a word for a moment, then pulled his mask off with one hand while still keeping the gun <br>pointed at Kerrison with the other. When Kerrison saw his expression, he knew he wasn't joking. <p>"Give me the girl and I won't. Make a move and I'll kill you right here." <p>Ellone saw the strange man pointing a gun at her new friend and began to cry. Kerrison glared at Eric and very, very <br>slowly turned and faced the girl. "Ellone," he said quietly "Remember those woods I told you about?" The frightened girl nodded, <br>eyes wide with terror. "When I give you the signal, I want you to run as fast as you can towards those woods. Don't look back, <br>don't wait for me. Just run." He turned back around to stare at Eric. "Come on man, I'm sure we can settle this like <br>civillized people -- we're both just rookies, right? Why should we obey that witch? What's she ever done for us, huh?" <p>A look of confusion passed over Eric's face. "It's not because of her. I have to be a good soldier. I have to make my dad proud." <br>He paused, then spoke again."I don't want him to hate me." The gun barrel wobbled, drooping slightly. <p>Kerrison took another step back and made a sweeping hand gesture at Ellone. She took off, running as fast as her short legs <br>would carry her towards the distant woods. At the same moment, he felt a searing, numbing pain explode in his chest and <br>looked down to see a dark stain covering the front of his uniform. He looked, stunned, at Eric and his smoking gun, then felt his <br>legs go numb as he fell to the ground. Vaguely he heard Ellone screaming and realized that she must've only run a short <br>distance and turned around. She had seen the whole thing. <p>Eric dropped the gun-scythe to the ground like it was red hot. "I didn't want to do it!! I didn't want to!! You made me do it!!" he <br>shreiked, pointing at Kerrison with a shaking finger. "I have to be a good soldier!! I have to be a good soldier!!" He shrieked <br>again and sprinted headlong in the opposite direction, almost running directly into a group of three soldiers who had come <br>running at the sound of the shot. One restrained the deranged soldier while another grabbed the still screaming Ellone roughly <br>by the arm. "Is this the girl?!" he shouted loudly at Eric, who was still quivering like he was wounded himself. <p>"HE made me do it!! He wouldn't let me have her!! He made me do it!!" Eric babbled, sobbing. No amount of cuffing or shouting <br>could get anything more from him. The soldier who had spoken to Eric sighed and left him in the care of the others, then walked <br>over to where Kerrison was stretched out on the ground in a fast-growing pool of crimson. He stared down at him for a moment, <br>nudged him with the toe of one boot, and reached down and plucked his gun-scythe away from the dirt where it had fallen. <br>Having done that, he turned and walked back to the other soldiers, one of whom was having trouble with the still-screaming, now <br>fighting little girl. <p>"Shut the hell up!!" he roared, back-handing the child on the cheek, then turned his ire onto the soldier "Can't you control a <br>goddamned three-year old?!!" The slap left a nasty welt, and Ellone's crying only increased in volume, although she quit fighting <br>them. "You'we vewy bad men!!" she sobbed, giving all four the nastiest look she could muster. <p>The lead soldier gave another annoyed sigh, then grabbed the girl bodily by the hair and picked her up, tucking her under one <br>arm like a piece of luggage. "Let's go, before one of the townsfolk shows." <p>As they prepared to leave, one of the other soldiers indicated in the direction of the prone body of Kerrison. "Hey Lance, what do we do <br>about him?" <p>The soldier holding Ellone shrugged. "What about him? Leave him, he's not worth packing out." <p>The others nodded and followed him off in single file, one still having to lead the incoherent Eric. They walked over the hill and <br>left Kerrison to the wild, the same wild he had hated since he entered it. <p>He had seen the whole preformance with Ellone and the soldiers. He had wanted to stop them from hitting her, wanted to help <br>her fight, but he couldn't seem to make his legs move. There was something warm and wet all around him; he seemed to be <br>lying in a puddle of it. <p>Oh yeah, that's right. My own blood. <p>When the soldier had stooped down and taken his gun Kerrison had seen it in slow motion, like a movie reel that was being <br>played back too slow. He had wanted to stop that too, but his whole body had gone numb. It felt so much better to just lie here <br>and not move. But when he saw them leaving him alone in the field, he had panicked. <p>Don't leave me here!! Come back!! I don't want to be alone, I hate being alone!! he had yelled in his mind. The soldiers had take no <br>heed of his silently screamed words, and in a few moments they had dissapeared over the horizon. He was all alone. <p>As the darkness crept into the edges of his vision, he realized he was dying. <p>Of course you are idiot, he thought, you just got shot. <p>He wished he could have helped the little girl-- what was her name? Ellie? He couldn't seem to remember anymore. He <br>just knew he had been supposed to help her in some way, and had failed miserably. She was being taken back to something <br>horrible, and he couldn't help. He could just lie here in this place he hated and let the blackness cover his vision. <p>He wished he didn't have to be alone, though. He knew he was too old for it, but he wanted his mommy. Mommy? He thought <br>frantically Where are you mommy?! Meg? Don't leave me here too!! <p>Just before he took his last breath, he had a moment of clarity. His vision cleared for a moment and he could see the sky above <br>him, a deep, rich blue. <p>I wonder if she's there waiting for me. Guess I'll have to go find out. <p>Then he knew nothing at all. <br>END<p>

I need to work on those Ecco fics, but this idea just popped into my head and pretty much took away a whole week of my life. Hope it was worth it ^_^<p>And I'm STILL getting fanmail, and it's still weirding me out. I wonder when I'll become jaded to it. For right now, though, I answer every e-mail I get. I'm being gracious through my big-headedness ^_~
