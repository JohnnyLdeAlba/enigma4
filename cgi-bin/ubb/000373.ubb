Pleads to stop before it's too late?....<Br> <Br>The Whales<br>By Debaser<p>The tubes hurt. His flippers hurt. And every time they turned that monstrosity on, he felt his life being ebbed away a bit <br>more. <p>Not that there was much life to take.<p>The gigantic grey whale sighed. How long had it been since he and his podmate had been free? He couldn't remember.<br>Every time they used the generator he lost a bit more of his memory, and the loss worried him more than the life being <br>sucked from his body. Dying he could stand. But forgetting how it was to be free............forgetting the name of his friend,<br>imprisoned across the pathway from his own tiny glass tank.........this he did not want to think about. <p>The grey hadn't thought any creatures could be as cruel as men, the two-legged creatures now almost long forgotten by <br>most sea denizens. They had pursued the whales for as long back as the giant mammals memories and legends went, <br>slaughtering without cause, never giving the giants a moments rest. With great exploding sticks that burst in the<br>whales bodies they had killed, or nets that blocked the ancestral pathways to the wintering grounds. So when the Clan had<br>driven men from the sea with their own far advanced weaponry, all cetacean life had rejoiced. <p>But power breeds the lust for more power, and if it is not kept in check, ignorance and greed can corrupt even the most <br>well-meaning. And the Clan soon surpassed even Man's ignorant cruelty.<p>With this unlimited, unchecked power they had created, dolphinkind needed something else to impress itself upon. And<br>the only animals on a level with the dolphins left in the sea unconquered were whales. So whales it was. The dolphins put <br>on strange armor and went on a spree of conquest that would've made the ancient vikings blush. It didn't take long for the<br>gentle whales to be supressed and exploited . Some escaped to unknown, deep waters, where the Clan could not find them.<br>Others were not so lucky. The Grey could still remember the day they had attacked his pod.....
