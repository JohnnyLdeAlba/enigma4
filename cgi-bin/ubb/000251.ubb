Z||000000||Miana||10-18-2000||05:48 PM||trixie2@mindspring.com||I had a dream last night about Ecco, but I should refer to it as a nightmare, because it was damn scary <IMG SRC="smilie21.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH=17 BORDER=0 ALT="errr"> But it ahs inspired me to write a story on this as well. Here's the beginning of it if you all would like to take a lookie loo.<p>Miana<br>"Let there be one, who would neither be friend nor foe."<p>*~*~*<p>“MIANA!!!!” she could hear his scream, it echoed out in her mind as she was sent crashing into the pools far below her. The salty water foamed and swirled around her, welcoming her back with seemingly open arms. The force of her collision into the deep pool knocked her senses unconscious, and she sank far beneath the water’s surface, leaving nothing but foam and bubbles. <p>“Miana!” Ecco shouted again, watching in terror as the young white dolphin slid in beneath the waves. He shuddered, wishing for what seemed too obvious had not truly happened to the young female. Ecco took one last glance at the pool that sat far beyond the higher and larger pool. His ears sensitive to any sound could hear the bellowing laughter coming from behind him. The gray dolphin spun around, eyes being set ablaze like a wildfire. <br>They were locked on to the indiscriminate form of an aquamarine colored sea nymph. Her eyes were the color of dark sands, and long deep green hair fell around her venomous face, that held a nasty smirk. Her fingers were long and curved, and long sadistically pointed nails, almost like a Raptor’s claw. And blood dripped from them, Miana’s own blood. That crimson shade made Ecco feel sick to his stomach, so much that even looking at those claws would make him puke.  The Sea Nymph seemed to be amused at Ecco’s disgusted look. She could see the tinge of fear in his dark eyes as he looked at her. <br>“It seems young Ecco,” she taunted, hoping to get to the young male’s mentality, “Your companion, I regret, may have just ended her life.”<br>Ecco winced as the words cut into him like knifes. He backed away, head shaking slowly to block out her rather curt words. It didn’t help. Not to a point where Ecco could let alone fight this nemesis.<br>“So brave was she,” the Nymph continued, “To lose her own life to save you.”<br>The Nymph grinned sagaciously, knowing that she was hitting the right keys. She hoped that her words would make the young savior feel enough guilt that he would no longer be able to fight.<br>“Yes so very brave,” she jaunted again, “And yet she was such a fool! She was one of the key points for you to have any chance of destroying me! Now you would never stand a chance, and Earth shall be destroyed since her effort had been into saving you! You are to blame for Earth’s fall to my power!” <br>I was to blame, Ecco thought, letting the words to finally sink in, I killed this world… I killed the last of an ancient singer race… I killed Miana…<br>She smiled and raised her hand, a dark colored light collected. Ecco looked at the light of the Nymph’s energy attack. His eyes were blank, just a black nothing that could not be filled. Her smile grew wider as she launched the ball of energy at the singer, who did not react. <br>Ecco could feel the power hit him hard in the melon, knocking him backward and sending him out of the pool, and into a nearby one. The dizziness in his head swirled around his mind, infusing themselves with images of his life, and of the Serenity Soul Dolphin he just truly began to know. <br>He looked up at Nautical, the Sea Nymph who knew she had triumphed. He watched as her hand pointed a long crooked finger at him, still covered with Miana’s crimson blood. <br>“You shall die by the blood of your friend!” Nautical hissed, and sent an electric bolt of 3000 watts into the neighboring pool that harbored Ecco. The pulse sent him reeling, screaming in pain as the bolts erupted in the body of water. Ecco’s eyes widened hurting from the shock, but they began to close as the Seas’ savior fell deeper and deeper into the water’s beckoning ‘hands’. <br>

Z||000006||Miana||10-19-2000||07:30 AM||trixie2@mindspring.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fmiana.gif"> <p>Actually that's the first Ecco dream I had in three to two years. Cause the first ever dream of Ecco I had, gave me the inspiration to create Miana.<p>Thanks, but I'm not finished with it, but if you want to put it up anyway Blackfin, till I get the rest finished it's okay with me.<p>Miana<br>"One is not truly happy if one wishes for more."

Its possible this dream represents a fear of something(perhaps falling). Interesting.<p>Actually you have several dreams every night. They're just VERY difficult to remember. Usually you remember a dream more easily if you wake up during one or just after one. I tend to have strange dreams for some reason.<p>I've heard as well that if any particular color appears in abbundance in a dream, that color probably means something. AND if something in your dream triggers your mind just a bit(not enough that it can wake you up) then you might realize when you are in a dream and you can control what happens in it. That happened to me once. I had a dream once where it was like it was new years eve way in the future or something and they had actually strung lights around the moon(they left it in space they just strung lights around it for the occasion), it looked really weird by the way. And then in a later dream, my subconsious self wised up and figured it might not be a dream. I though in the dream, "If this is a dream, then I bet those lights could be on the moon." And I looked out the window and sure enough. Trouble is I don't remember what else I did after I started controling my dream.

Buddy had a dream about him finding a Dreamcast in the closet and waking up disappointed, him falling off a roof because of a bird, and of falling off a cliff several times. One of his "unique" falling dreams was he got out of dad's car and fell off a cliff. Another one was he was in a war and he was Chinese and was fighting against U.S. I had another dream that the aliens from <br>Alien and Aliens were underground next to my house and I woke up thinking that and alien was gonna pop out of my stomach. I think that's all we remember. Aren't they strange?
