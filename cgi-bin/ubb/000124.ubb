I got through most of it without the walkthrough, until I got to the place where the rocks have to be crushed.  I pushed one right under the crusher.  The crush thing came down on the rock, but nothing happened.  The walkthroughs dont help, either.<p>Could anyone give me fan-to-fan info here?

He is my favorite charactor and is the one most of my GIF's feature my sites at http://members.aol.com/JKwok44/ its more JKwok44's then mine but I help.  By the way I am not a dubbie.
