Z||000004||Debaser13||10-29-2000||06:02 PM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||You like? I didn't even know you were a FF7 fan. Thanks for the praise <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> <Br> <Br> And "The Happening" WILL get finished. You're the second person to corner me about this today. I promise, it will be finished....and while you wait, go to my site and check out some of the fanfics there. MUCH better than mine.

(I got a pic of Bahamut posted at RPGamer this summer (under my old nick Repty))<br>I've already had a look at the fanfics at your site, but I haven't read much yet so I will... ^_^<br>

I've got that saved in one of my files, it's great! I was going to e-mail you and see if I could use it on my site....I didn't know it was YOU. Wow...strange how communities interloop, no?
Z||000007||Buddy||10-31-2000||07:10 AM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbuddy.gif"> I like FF8 better because I never played FF7.
Z||000008||Debaser13||10-31-2000||09:41 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Then you don't know if you like it better. That's just ignorance.
Z||000009||dragonboy||10-31-2000||06:55 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||buddy, get ff7.  its a good game, especially if you like role-playing games.  The price is most likely very reducved compared to how much it used to be.
Z||000010||Buddy||10-31-2000||07:32 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbuddy.gif">  First: I am NOT ignorant, Debaser.<br>Second: Me and Coral are trying to get it from our cousin. She doesn't like it. Don't ask why cause I don't know!
Z||000011||dragonboy||10-31-2000||09:32 PM||returner8@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/me2/xcrispy/art/dolph4.gif">   WHEE!<p>Anyways, debaser, i think buddy just meant he likes ff8 since, and since he can't compare it to ff7, he'll like ff8 in the meantime.  and buddy, debaser just meant to not compare something until you've had a chance to try the other as well.  its the same as judging someone before you have a chance to get to know them a little better.  i'm sure this was just a miscommunication error between you two. and i hope you get that game soon from that girl who doesn't like it.

FF8 fanfics? <IMG SRC="eek.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="surprised"> Woooow...<br>Come to think of it: do any of you like Pokémon? If you do, I'll surprise you. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><p><br>Friecco<br>"It Starts"
Z||000013||Debaser13||11-01-2000||04:52 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||That's exactly what I meant, Dragonboy. You can't say you don't like something until you try it. <p>And everyone's tastes are different. I like FF7 better than FF8, and some people like FF6 *tha'd be FF3 for some of you* better than 7. It's all a matter of taste.<p>Yep! There are lots of FF8 fanfics out there. Rocket Town's got an entire section devoted to them. I can give you the addy if you want. But FF7 fics are still the most frequent.
Z||000014||Buddy||11-01-2000||07:01 AM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fbuddy.gif"> <br>Poke'mon's ok.It's not the best thing in the world. My favorite pokemon is Mewtwo and I like to use Mewtwo, Starmie, Arcanine, Exeggucutor, Jolteon, and Dugtrio. Coral likes to use Flareon, Vaporeon, Zapdos, Articuno, Jolteon, and Mewtwo. Those are our favorites and we won every battle. Its very difficult when we are against each other.<br>Oh MAN!!!! We were at a Halloween party at our cousin's house but we forgot all about it!
