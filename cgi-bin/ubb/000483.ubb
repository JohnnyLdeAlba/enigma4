Well, as far as I know the CD version was released right after the MegaDrive version. So it's odd to see these graphics also appearing in TOT which was released years after the first game...<p>Well, also the dolphins who appear in these levels talk some interesting stuff (including the Level descriptions):<p><i>VOLCANIC REEF<br>Bones Of Strange Floating Whales Are Found Here. They Are Infested With Dangerous Fish<p>SHIP GRAVE SEA<br>Dangerous Caves With Fierce Currents. The Turtles May Help But Not Willingly<p>- The Bones Are Very Old...<br>  They Are From The Sunken City<p>- Light From The Sky Made Them Rest Here<p>WRECK TRAP<br>Very Few Songs By Singers Who Guard The Entrance To The Marble Sea<p>THE SEA OF SILENCE<p>DEEP GATE<br>The Sunken City Is Through The Mountain Of Stone. Glyphs Open Passages In This Place.<p>- The Marble Sea Is Beyond<p>- The Marble Sea Is A Beautiful Place...<br>  But It Is Frightening There I Hear<p>- Very Few Singers Have The Songs Of The Sunken City<p>- Strange Shells Hold Air And Ascend<p>- Collect Air In Something That Is Empty</i><p>Especially the SHIP GRAVE SEA level message are totally great! I guess they mean the laser beam attack by the Vortex like it is told you by the Glyphs in "The Library". Weird how they know about it since not many get to Atlantis...<p>This Mountain of Stone is also interesting... Does the dolphin mean an underwater mountain? Kinda...<p>Anyway, what do you all think about this all?

But I always loved these paraphrases by the "ocean inhabitants" <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> It makes a cool underwater athmosphere where is no contact to humans! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
