If any one can tell me where I can find screenshots, I'd be so honoured.<br><IMG SRC="smilie6.gif" HEIGHT=90 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="bouncing">

There is no pause, but 3 characters to chose from<p>Ecco<br>Kitnee<br>Tara<p>when you press start in game play you can switch a player.  You have no sonar map, but your sonar bounces off of the thing(s) you need to find.

A rom is a compressed form of a program, a game, and is made to work on a similar program.  You will need a compatible emulator to run this rom on.  The emulator is like a program that copies the actions of a game console and allows your computer to play these roms.  For example one genesis emulator is called genesyst.  You can find more detailed information on how to use roms and emulators at www.emux.com, and there you can find emulators and roms that allow you to play just about every old video game system's games on your pc!
