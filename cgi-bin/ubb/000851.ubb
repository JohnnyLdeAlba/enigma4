Z||000000||GTK||06-09-2001||01:07 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||You are to be the members of the Uncharted Waters pod in Tidesinger 2. Well, maybe not Arkon. I'm not sure exactly what he meant to say in his reply to the "Who Wants To Be In Tidesinger 2?" post. Pending his reply there may be another vacancy, there may not (if there is, does one of the latest newbies fancy it?). And quite possibly not Trace either. Trace: you don't have to be a dolphin. Or put it this way, it's easy enough to put a dolphin in the story with your attributes and call it Trace. <p>Now then, all of you who said you wanted to be in it: what you have to do is reply to this post and tell me about your character. <p>Name: <br>Sex: <br>Age: <br>Personality: (three or four keywords only please) <br>Appearance: (reasonably detailed) <p>Don't give me background history because it all needs to fit in with the story. And no super powers. Well, I suppose some super powers are okay, but you're all getting cameos so there's not much point trying to save the day. Actually I may be able to use Coral's telekinesis in some way... <p>And blackfin gets to be pod leader by default, so don't complain ^_^; Why? You want to know why? Because... uh... his name begins with a B. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

But I'll simplify it for now...<p>Name: Trace<br>Sex: Male<br>Age: Unknown<br>Personality: Intelligent, quick thinker, musical, avoidant, (Creative, yet not exactly any kind of hero, dislikes fightin')<br>Appearance: Slightly thin, a very dark ocean blue/black colour, with red streaks from his head to tail fin across his body and fins. Noticably, he has a fairly large Tail fin compared to the average dolphin.<p>And he doesn't really have any Super Powers...<p>

He is very distrustful of others motives, so when he gets suspicious he can get quite nasty, but normally he is very nice)<br>Appearance:  Hard to be very detailed for me, I'm just an average bottlenosed dolphin but with a pitch black dorsel fin.

Well               there you go! Exept that he has<br>              a circle shaped scar just below his right               eye which has a strange Blueish<br>              glow to it...(Recieved in a chance               encounter with the Vortex)
Z||000008||Trellius||06-09-2001||05:00 PM||thedolphin@ananzi.co.za||as an afterthought, for those who do not know the Hourglass Dolphin I've provided this: <p> Not very much is known about the hourglass dolphin, since it is rarely seen at sea.  It frequents waters only in the southern hemisphere, preferring to stay in cooler waters. They stay mostly far offshore, in the open ocean, though sometimes they come in closer. They have an extensive range, and can be found in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.<br><br>The species name for the Hourglass dolphin, cruciger, means "cross-bearing" and describes the pattern on the dolphin's sides. It vaguely resembles an hourgl ***  with wider white parts at the front and back portions of the body, with a narrow strip just below the dorsal fin. White also circles the eye slightly, similar to the spectacled porpoise. The black rostrum, like other lags, is short.<br><br>Usually found in groups of 7-10, these dolphins are not at all shy when encountered, and often bow ride, even approaching slower moving vessels. Sometimes they'll spin while riding the waves. When they bowride, they swim in long low leaps and may resemble a porpoising penguin. They may also create a "roostertail" of spray when surfacing to breathe at high speeds.<br>If I could remember how I would have added a picture but..oh well
Z||000009||dolphingirl||06-09-2001||05:29 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Wow! Thanks for the description of the Hourglass Dolphins! I enjoyed reading it, as I'm not too well versed in research on dolphins (shame on me... <IMG SRC="crookedsmile.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="crooked smile"> ...I know). So, thanks Trellius!

I'll do my best, though... vantid, you can join because I like you =P Dolphinjoy, you should've asked first but I'd like to use your character anyway because the species will make things more interesting. Cortex, you can't use the Power of Morphing unless you wanna screw up the storyline because it uses the idea of the Forbidden Power (of Metamorphosis) a lot. Let me know if you still want to be in it. HazardousRaptor, just create a dolphin character and I'll try and fit you in as well. <p>Re: Trellius's post... <br>*wonders why on EARTH the board saw fit to censor "hourgl **** "*
