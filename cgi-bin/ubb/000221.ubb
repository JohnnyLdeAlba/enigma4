And after you accomplish a mission, he'll say something different.  Try all sorts of things.  It is really fun.<p>My favorites include what happens when you ram Pilot as he leads you to the Prime Mover.  He says something to the effect of: "Hey!  I'm Pilot, the son of the Chief Mover!  Well, if you get lost, I'll come back to get you.  I'd never miss the lobtailing you're in for."<p>Or, when you race the dolphins in Perils of the Coral Reef.  If you jump off to early, the dolphin will go up to you and say, "You are a cheater!"<p>I like that part.  In the early Ecco titles, they didn't do that because of the space it took to make messages.<p>One exception exists in Tides of Time.  In Four Islands, when Tara or Blackfin or whoever (The first dolphin that leads you somewhere) tries to lead you and you get lost, he or she says different things each time they come back for you.  Like "Nice to meet you again,"  and, "I am not sure you are the famous Ecco."  Until finally he or she gives you the stone shattering song and says, "Here is the song you need to shatter the stones.  Good luck." and he or she swims off.<p>So, I encourage you to try talking as much as you can under different conditions.

I loved that part especialy pissing him off I always get my kicks off that

It depends on our personality. <Br> <Br> But I do think that was Blackfin.It just.........damn, I dunno how to explain it...........it just seemed more like .....well, Blackfin, y'know ?

After you get the first mark, go back to the room with two dolphins in it and keep talking to one of them (They both say the same things, so it doesn't matter which one you talk to.) One of the things he will say is "I am a guard, not an usher. Open the door for yourself!" <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
Z||000004||Histronic||10-14-2000||05:21 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Hehe.  I liked that part.  But, In Lair of Evil, become a general and talk to them.  Instead of being rude, they say "Good day, sir!" and "Welcome, sir!"
Z||000005||That guy with the hat||10-14-2000||08:20 PM||||Become a general and talk to that other general that helped you and he realizes your not one of them. "Wait a minute, I know you! You're the one I sent to fix the branding mechanism! But now you wear my mark! You are an imposter! Guards!" Or something like that(guards never come and you don't have to fight him so don't worry.
