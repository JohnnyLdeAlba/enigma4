If you can't print it...take specific notes! That's the only thing I'm afraid that will help! If you want to p *** that level as bad as it sounds you do...write down everything from the walkthrough...and try to draw the map that's provided. It's too long of a level for someone to explain...and you take that for memory and try to play the level. Oh, and if you're going in circles...take a different path?! I wish I could help you more...maybe if you give me a specific area you're stuck on...I'll help you from there. Maybe I'll sorta write my own walkthrough for ya...that is if I find time. Have you gone to this walkthrough:<p> <A HREF="http://guides.ign.com/guides/12357/man4.html" TARGET=_blank>http://guides.ign.com/guides/12357/man4.html</A>

Look for those that match the colors of a closed door. But they also control the water level, if there's a water level display in that room. The water level display is a square partly colored blue to show the current water level. It has two arrows, one for high and one for low water level. When you sonar a colored control, the water level will rise / sink to the highlighted (white) arrow on the display. Always try to raise the water level, since it will open new tunnels for you. Take care not to lower the water unless you really have to. If you have problems remembering the way, the newest paths will usually be the highest.<p>I hope that made some sense...
