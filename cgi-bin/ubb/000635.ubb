Z||000003||vantid||01-30-2001||12:53 PM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Well, damn. I have the worst luck with computers. My own computer at home is so crapped up it can barely think staight.  Thing is, it worked fine until it was given to me. Anyway, the picture was scanned then opened in Corel Photopaint where I spent all day yesterday working on it.  It lacks the quality it would have had if Id done it by hand but oh well.

Z||000011||vantid||01-31-2001||08:44 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||I wish I could Coral, but its hard! It took me 4 years just to teach myself how to draw a dolphin. Reptyx, congrats on on your win! What medium or program do you use?<br>
Z||000012||Reptyx||01-31-2001||03:50 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx_h.jpg"> <br>thanks vantid! I was very surprised, I thought for sure that you'd win. I think you are more skilled than me.<br>I use acrylics on paper, and I only use the computer to make minor adjustments, such as removing the ugly lines my scanner leaves.<br>So, what medium do you use?
Z||000013||vantid||02-01-2001||08:39 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||I use colored pencil on pastel paper...I cannot paint worth a crap. The I feel that I have more control with pencils. 
Z||000014||Coral||02-01-2001||05:27 PM||ntraver@epix.net||[img]http://www.arkonviox.com/fp/2coral.gif[/mg] I use colored pencils too, Vantid! I don't really like using paint and pastels. <br>I just scetch something, color it with colored pencils and darken the lines.<p>I drew a wolf today and it looks real neat!
Z||000015||blackfin||02-02-2001||03:20 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Reptyx, renember what I told you ages back....  I told you that you WOULD win, I actually thought Vantid might beat you for a bit with the way the poll went but you made it.... so I guess my prediction was right.
Z||000016||Reptyx||02-03-2001||04:53 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx_h.jpg"> <p>vantid, did you draw Dolphina with colored pencils? wow!<p>I don't feel really comfortable with any medium... I think I've got best control with pencil, but it smudges and is kind of boring. I like to use a combination of a felt-tip pen and watercolor or watercolor pencils, but I can't quite get the hang of anything of that: watercolor gets all sloshy, watercolor pencils doesn't get even enough, and with the felt-tip pen I'm always afraid of making a mistake. Acrylics is cool, but it takes a lot of work...<p>I can't draw using computers, at least not the photoshop way (haven't even got PhotoShop! (I should get it, I know, I know ^^<IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">). I've tried ASCII art but never had the patience to get very good at it. I want to learn PovRay, but I don't know anything about 3D-graphics.<br>the strangest thing I've done is making pictures out of graphs on my graphing calculator, but I've only done two, an iguana and a cat... <br>this is getting out of hand... o_O I better stop now! ^_~

Z||000018||vantid||02-05-2001||08:32 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Yeah, graphite pencils do smudge if you're not careful. Yeah, Dolhpina (which was actaully a typo, it was just plain dolphin, its official title is Ethereal Dreams)was done is colored pencil-all hail Prismacolor brand pencils!! Plus, I cant draw on computer programs, and the Earthdragon was the first time I colored a sketch on the computer. Coral, post your wolf...I love wolves...dolphins, then wolves, then tigers. Do you have a sketchbook, Coral? If not, get one, a nice one thats hardbound, like a real book. They are only 7-10 dollars for an 8x10.
Z||000019||Coral||02-05-2001||09:15 AM||ntraver@epix.net||I have a scetch book but I use all the paper in one day! I'll try and post more of my drawings and maybe make my own website to put them in. THAT IS A BIG MAYBE. <br>Today, I'm working on a black unicorn, another anime person, Blizzara the app pegasus again with Selis riding him, a white dragon, and a half horse half fish thing.<br>
Z||000020||vantid||02-05-2001||09:32 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||ALL THE PAPER!?!?!?!?!?!<br>Hmmm...you do a lot of practice. That helps a lot, especially when you look back through your old stuff.
Z||000021||Coral||02-06-2001||09:12 AM||ntraver@epix.net||I just finished the white dragon(Aero Dragon) <br>and Orion the black unicorn. They look great!<br>I love drawing fantasy creatures and monsters the best!<br>Although, I'm pretty low on paper...I'll just take all the paper from the folders in my school locker and use that.
Z||000022||vantid||02-06-2001||09:40 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Hey! Orion! I love Orion. It has awesome nebulas. I agree with you Coral...fantasy creatures are fun to draw and you can add all sorts of flourishes and other extra stuff, plus, no one can say that it doesnt look right cuz how the heck would they know what a dragon looks like, huh? Or a unicorn? Anyway, perhaps my dear, sweet friend PsySonic could post my whole Earth Dragon for me. Draw from your dreams, if you dont already, Coral. Dreams put together truly original images, images that the conscienc mind cant grasp until shown by the sub-conscience.
