I'm still an ass hole but I am a great asshole. Mwa ha ha he he he. For those of you who dont know me I like blackfin am making my own Ecco fan based game. So far my brother has made lots of artwork to illustrate what my stories gonna be like! But I have been lagging on my part to focusing on C plus plus and direct X study and my story. But I will have a game at the least!<p>Of course I won't be in often anymore because I am constantaly working at my job plus I have a website of my own plus the only way to get this site to come up is through a long distance provider! Yeah this website doesnt come up in my city richmond in california! <p>So I'm still at the same place I've been doomed to arkonviox.com my home! I think it's my web providers fault for making it hard to get to good ol new zealand! So If you thought I died remember how I wrote my story...<p>"Arkonviox is an immortal, let it be stones or drought that will open his wounds but in the end Arkonviox will never die!"<p>As arrogant as I may sound thats how my chracters portrayed. Arkonviox is my Ecco chracter who closley matches me! So let it be known that I won't fall to nobody! But at the least I'm glad to be back!!!! and missed this place!!!!<p>"It's the heart of the savoir that keeps the flow of the tides of time."<p><p>

I am the last of the infamous clan the seven dark whales! It was a clan of black orcas who lived and then died! I am the otherside of Arkonviox which means in forums chat we are one! Since I love to act out chracters I might as well be both since were both different but very simliar. I am the one who back hands arky when he gets outha hand so there!<p>Mwa ha ha ha ha ha ha he he he he

Well two ways...<p>1. - Buy a book on a programming launguage such as C++ and learn the whole 7685Pg book by heart trying out all tutorials you find OR search the web for as many C++ tutorials as you can, Direct X tutorials are handy two, for both 2D and 3D game engines, while you've spent cash on that, buy a decent compliler such as Boreland (Go to ask jeeves, you can fime some there) and make some simple programs. ONce done, you're ready to write your own program! First get the story sorted out, the plot, and make sure everything fits well. While this goes on, either rip or create your own sprites for use in the game and also some nice BackGrounds. Then begin programming the engine for the movement of your game and the grpahics etc. Use of Direct X programming is a good advantage for game programmers (Results of fangames I've seen using DX are very good indeed). Then you can work on level design for each individual level and all the events and puzzles within that level. SOunds and music are also required so once again, that leaves you up for searching for the right sounds. And just to note, once you've learned and mastered C++, I've seen that almost anything's possible, even competing with commercial games... (Although ot Fangames, that's an illegal breach of (c), so long as you don't sell them)<p>And as for Mode 2...<p>2 - Get a kind of 'Game Making Program' such as Dark BAsic (For creating 3D engines) or JaMagic (Yet to be released 3d game engine, rumours are that an early version of this was the so called 'Game World Builder' used for Ecco DoF itself) or if you want to go 2D, simple progs like Click and Create or The Games Factory to the more advanced MultiMedia Fusion can be used, although it's best that you go for MMF if you're serious. It's a little simple to learn than a whole programming lanuage such as C++, but results may not be as good as those of C++<p>And just for the note, I havn't any knowledge of C++ at all. I know many people that do and the games they have made with them are quite astounding, but it will take you time and money to learn C++ well. If you really wish to become a professional games programmer (Like Meesa) then it would be ideal, but for now, I'll stick with the simple things in life...<p>
