Z||000005||Delphi||10-07-2000||11:26 PM||vampirekiwi@hotmail.com||I'm sure she's not stupid, she just missed a few things, is all. I do that all the time!! So let's not start pointing fingers... we don't have enough fingers. <IMG SRC="sick.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="sick"> lI

What site do you enter to access it, i joined one too. If your wondering who i am, im Tassonyi bloodfist on the ezboard. I'd show you his face pic but its too big, i had to shrink it thru adobe. I go to a web site called teamartail.com, i luv that site as muck as i luv dis one, its cool!

For one thing,I don't go around picking out people's punctuation errors, else I'd never get TIME to post on this message board. I've been to Forums with a lot better typing, and yet I'm hanging around at this one, just because I like the game and some of the people seem nice enough.<Br> <Br> You, on the other hand, I could spend nitpicking at all day.Not just the fact that you seem to enjoy being rude to the others, but that you constantly try to hype your webpage and are obsessed with a race of dolphins who's Nazi-ish overtones are apparent.If you hadn't called Kimbit stupid, I wouldn't have said anything at all.So let that be a warning : If you're rude to someone else, I'm going to be your Karma.<Br> <Br> In other words, kindly <B> SOD OFF </B> <Br> <Br> Oh, and anyone who spends all their time spamming the board shouldn't tell me about my apparant lack of a life.Hell, do <i> any </i> of us have lives ? People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones -- it makes them an easier target for my sniper rifle.<Br>

I can give you the addresses if you want them, but one is just this role playing board about a story, and the other is Sailormoon, so... unless you'd like to do or talk about either, I'm guessing you don't want to see...?
Z||000012||Arkonviox||10-08-2000||01:52 PM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/farkonviox.gif">  First off let me start by saying screw your karma, I'll do what I want when I want and there aint no one (but blackfin) who will stand in my way!<p>Now whats with you and nizis anyway are you jew or something, probably! If you have a problem with my ideas your getting on bloodfin too! <p>But let me start off by telling you debaser your the most stupidist thing i've seen since the backstreet boys making an alliance with nsync and even though thats never happened it would be very stupid!<p>I really think you dont have a life I on the other hand do I have my own site with my own url I may have an annoying banner but eventualy that will change, I may do alot of talking about it but thats cause I have an idea for a game and that show you my life I'm doing a web page plus programming a game!<p>You on the other hand probaly visit hundreads of message boards, since you noticed my come backs are bad that shows me that all you do is sit on a computer all day making boring posts and trying to get on peoples cases. So you think your my karma think again I'll let it be known that you the trash who seems to be obssed with me and has nothing better to do but to post where I post!<p>Well just call you second baser since thats where I seem to have hit it off with you. But look on the bright side once we hit third base I already used and abused you. heck you'll call me daddy or arkon daddy.<p><IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> I love people who love me I know I'm great you dont have to act like you hate me

In other words if you have something smartassed to say come out and say it otherwise dont bother!

Look, i hate my brother equally as much as all of you do, but if 2 PPL are getting on 1 persons case, i suggest you shut the hell up and stay out, i dont hate you and would rather be your friend but if your gonna take sides, then you had better stay outta my way! Second on to Debaser, you have a problem with the charicters i worked to create? Nazi? Where the hell did you come up with that?! I put atleast 3 years of effort into my work and to be put down by a peasant like you is completely wrong,  You cant go and upset PPL outta no where. If you see someone doing something stupid, then instead of bieng apart of it, stay the hell out! I thought you were smarter than that,  your a women right? Here where i come from, we have a word for women like you debaser: BITCH! If you have any sense or dignity, you wont reply, and if you do you are exactly what i said you were...I will apoligize for anything i said, if you agree to get off our case, and why is everything to ytou nazi? Are you jewish, or can you find a better word. Your affending me and my brother, and well your sitting on your ass making a reply cuz your obviosly not listening to a damn word i say, arent you...?
Z||000017||Delphi||10-09-2000||12:17 AM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Don't worry, Bloodfin. I'm not gonna take sides. Just amused, is all.
Z||000018||Debaser13||10-09-2000||03:25 AM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||I wasn't talking about <i> your </i> characters, Bloodfin.I was talking about the dolphins in the game, the Clan or whatever they're called.Not the ones you created, which I don't know anything about.<Br> <Br> Second of all, if I <i> was </I> Jewish, would there be some problem with that ? Please, do tell me what's wrong with Jews and women. Enlighten me to your mighty wisdom, which endless days of watching television talk shows and listening to insipid rap/rock bands have endowed you with. <Br> <Br> And trust me, Arky baby, it just wouldn't work out. I'm engaged to a guy who, thankfully, dosn't think human culture peaked when <i> Jerry Springer </i> hit the airwaves. He's thankfully not even American, as I've shunned my country because of this culture of idiocy it's feeding.<Br> <Br> The number of message boards I frequent other than this place are <i> Trois </i>, and I love each community I'm at. In between playing guitar, writing, spending time with said fiance, and maintaining my <i> own </i> webpage, I enjoy going to Shera's Kitchen *http://www.insidetheweb.com/mbs.cgi/mb280165/*, Synthetic Pawn, run by my good friend Tristan *http://www.syntheticpawn.com/msgboard.mv* and Ex-Okay *www.ex-okay.com* All three very tightly knit communities, and places I'm proud to be a part of. <Br> <Br> Oh, why should I even bother with this. It'll just result in another badly-written "Yo mama" "Yo daddy" or "Yo relative of choice" comeback attempt culled from some talk show or high school cafeteria. Sod it, I'm not even gonna respond again. Yeah, I'm a bitch. I learned from the masters : Asuka Langley, Courtney Love, Liz Phair, and Daria Morgandorfer.<Br> <Br> <i> "Fill me in on your new vision <Br> wake me up with indecision <Br> help me trust your mighty wisdom......"</i>

Z||000020||Delphi||10-11-2000||12:10 AM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Arkon, you won't mind me saying that I was also trying to follow the advice you gave Debaser... staying out of your way. You know why I'm posting this, I think. Please. I'm asking you nicely. I'd rather try to be the mature people we are and get over that one disagreement we had on that other board which *apparetntly* started this whole "I hate you" thing off. Let's just can the crap and exist like normal people, please.
