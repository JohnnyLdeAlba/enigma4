Z||000005||Debaser13||10-28-2000||03:09 PM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||<IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fdebaser.gif"/IMG SRC> O.K, O.K., sheesh. I'm in England, which is why I didn't know. Cartoon Network over here is different. But damn, I wish the U.S CN played over here. Is it Tenchi : The TV series or the original version? I've seen all the original episodes on tape; they're great. Ryo-Ohki is SOOOOO sweet....<Br>
Z||000006||dragonboy||10-28-2000||03:48 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||eao, you make me laugh.  i am so sick of the same commercials on the cartoon network, it really irritates the hell out of me.  like that finger baby doll, the lullaby cd commercial, and that leg and head pillow thing....ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, stop the madness.
Z||000007||Eao||10-29-2000||09:23 AM||collprin@warwick.net||actually.........i sometimes just play with the thing, i don't know where some of the commercials came from.
