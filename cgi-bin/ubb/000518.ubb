You could also a typical Level name for each track, also listed on that thread. You will find out...

Gawain Dragon here, and this is my first post.  I'm a rabid Ecco fan.<br>I have the Sega CD versions of both 'Ecco the Dolphin' and 'Ecco: Tides of Time', as well as Spencer Nielsen's music CD, 'Ecco: Songs of Time'.  Here's what you're looking for.  The songs on the Sega CDs are longer.  Not all the songs in the game made it onto the music CD, so I don't know what to name those... I haven't bothered to match them to the specific levels they're played in.  Hope this helps out!<p><br>Ecco The Dolphin - Sega CD<p><br>Track 1 - Data Track<br><br>Track 2 - Aqua Vistas<br><br>Track 3 - Time Forgotten<br><br>Track 4 - Lonesome Search<br><br>Track 5 - Friend Or Foe<br><br>Track 6 - (*not on Songs of Time CD) <br><br>Track 7 - Motion E<br><br>Track 8 - The Machine<br><br>Track 9 - (short version of The Machine, chorus only) <br><br>Track 10 - (short version of The Machine, verse only) <br><br>Track 11 - (The Machine, sound effects added) <br><br>Track 12 - (short version of The Machine, chorus only, quiet mix) <br><br>Track 13 - (*not on Songs of Time CD) <br><br>Track 14 - Sounding Echo<br><br>Track 15 - (*not on Songs of Time CD) <br><br>Track 16 - (*not on Songs of Time CD) <p><br>Ecco: Tides of Time - Sega CD<p><br>Track 1 - Data Track<br><br>Track 2 - Abyss<br><br>Track 3 - St. Gabriel's Mask<br><br>Track 4 - Mountains Below<br><br>Track 5 - Treefish<br><br>Track 6 - Transcended<br><br>Track 7 - Blue Dream<br><br>Track 8 - Deep Marjimba<br><br>Track 9 - Botswana<br><br>Track 10 - (*not on Songs of Time CD) <br><br>Track 11 - The Desert Below<br><br>Track 12 - Heart of the Giant<br><br>Track 13 - Deception<br><br>Track 14 - (*not on Songs of Time CD) <br><br>Track 15 - (short version of Transcended) <br><br>Track 16 - (Aqua Vistas from Ecco The Dolphin Sega CD<br><br>Track 17 - (short version of The Machine, chorus only) <br><br>
