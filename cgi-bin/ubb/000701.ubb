It may sound crazy, but that slow-paced song drove me on to comlete all four of my long-term projects in 4 hours!  Man, I am sooooooooo tired... <IMG SRC="tired.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="tired"> <br>

I remastered (Well, stuck it through a Yamaha synth and recorded) 2 Ecco songs in midi format, one was the Machine (Which sounds cool) and the other was Fault Zone (Which sounds ok)<p>Maybe I could convince AJ to use his supadupa Synth

I'm curious to listen to them! And what about your site? Are you ever gonna resurvive it, cause I really liked it and the music and stuff... <i>*sigh*</i>
