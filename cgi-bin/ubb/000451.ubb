I mean, if you go to Geocities you can either use the Pagebuilder OR write your own HTMLed pages, so I think you can't really do wrong with them.<p>Ideas for a site? I seem to recall telling someone here to make an Ecco: Choose Your Own Adventure type thing, where you write the scenario and then give people a choice of what they want to do, then they follow the link they like and see where the story takes them. See, I'd do it, but I already have something like that in mind... only it doesn't pertain to Ecco.<p>Put lotsa pics to look at, as long as you don't clutter the page with 'em like I HAVE THE BAD, HORRIBLE, EVIL HABIT OF DOING! *mwa hahahaaaaaaa...* Pics make a site purrrty!<p>Come up with a decent layout that isn't confusing!<p>I personally also find sites that are interactive (like this one) very attracting. They're fun as hell!<p>Did that help, Vortex? <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
