But he shrunk back. Darlene had a very strange look on her face. Strange even for her.<p>“ Ash,” she said in a tone of voice Ash had never heard anyone use before. “ Ash, we’re in this room, alone.”<p>“ Yea,” Ash said, obliviously. “ So let’s get back to the party. “<p>“ Ash, let’s have a party up here. Just you and me. “<p>“ Darlene?”<p>Darlene began to unbutton Ash’s shirt. “ Ash, this is what I’ve wanted, ever since we met ... I’ve dreamed of this moment when we could be alone ... “<p>“ Darlene?” Ash said, his voice reaching new tonal heights.<p>“ Ash, I’m burning with desire,” she said as she drew close to him.<p>“ Darl .. “<p>Before Ash could say any more, Darlene kissed him passionately. Her kiss was so full of her overwhelming passion for him that soon she had forced him backward onto the bed. But it was clear that Ash did not share her feelings. Soon, Darlene stopped and sat on the bed dejectedly as Ash buttoned his shirt back up.<p>“ Ash, what’s wrong? Why can’t we ... “<p>“ Darlene, I’m sorry, but ... I like you and everything, but you’re just my friend. You’ll always be just my friend,” Ash said. Also, Darlene’s aggressiveness had nearly scared Ash to death.<p>“ You mean we ... “<p>“ Darlene, I guess DD was right,” Ash said. “ You really do ... “<p>“ Ash,” Darlene said, with tears in her eyes. “ I want to be your girlfriend. You’re so cool, and you’re the only one ... the only one who’s ever been nice to me. Well, you and DD ... Ash, I care about you. I just want you to be happy. But please, don’t choose Misty. She treats you so awful. “<p>“ Misty and I are friends, just like you and I are friends,” Ash said as he held Darlene closer. “ And I care about all my friends. “ <p>Darlene wept quietly as Ash held her close. This, of course, was not good when Misty slammed open the door to the room.<p>“ Ash Ketchum, I finally found ..... AHHHHH!” Misty screamed.<p>Everything in the room, for a split second, seemed frozen in time. Then, in slow, exaggerated motion, Ash pushed Darlene away as he said “ It’s not what you think,” while Misty yelled, “ you sneaky, *BEEEEEEP BEEEP*” as she then wrestled Darlene to the ground. Finally, Ash had had enough.<p>“ Hypno,” Ash yelled as the action sped back up to normal. “ Disable!”<p>Hypno’s disable attack froze Misty and Darlene,who were tangled on the ground. Fortunately ( and unrealistically ), their new clothes were not damaged.<p>*********************************************<br>................that's all for now...........<br>

Z||000006||Friecco||01-16-2001||01:04 AM||nikovic@brockfan.zzn.com||"THE POINT" is that this girl (her name is Darlene), she loves Ash as much as Misty does, But they fight over him almost all the time.<br> <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> AAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW......
