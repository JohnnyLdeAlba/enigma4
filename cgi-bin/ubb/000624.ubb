I'm sure that's exactly what you'ld do, but ...here's the funny thing...<i>*motions to him to come closer, and whispers*</i> ...see, I'm the one who won it, and here's the real kicker! I'm not you! HAH! So...I don't think I'll be taking a bat to my PS2...like I said. It's not a great gaming system, but the one game for it, SSX, is so much fun!!! And for that reason alone, it stays inside and won't make it to the roof with a bat! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">

I have a few things to point out.<p>1. How the hell can I figure you out when your spelling is so crappy, I couldn't even see your point of view if I cared!<p>2. If you're so tired of people making fun of you, why don't you get rid of that asshole aura that seems to surround you?<p>3. People like me make your life bad?  Ha!  It seems you finally said something funny, though unintentionally.  YOU control your life, idiot, not me.  And another thing, there are many synonyms for "bad" that would have made you sound halfway intelligent.<p>Final Verdict: You're such a moron I don't know why you come here.  Someone with your pathetic brain wouldn't even know how to plug a controller in, much less figure out an Ecco game.  Have a crappy day.

Your crack stash ran out, and so did your moms.<p>2. You forgot to take that d***o out of your ass again.<p>3. Racing Horomones<p>Final Conclusion: You have so many things fu**ing your life up you yell at Cortex.  Why not just ignore him, instead of yelling at him?  Because yelling at him won't make him act any differently.  I would know.  So, do us all a favor, and shut the hell up.

Sure, it could be all fine if we just ignored him, but I've looked at this now for some months, and never got any better. He doesn't understand that we ignore his posts and he still goes on with them, so that has to be stopped by a different way...

Why don't we all learn to laugh at his posts, instead of critisize them?  That's what I do, most of the time I think they're pretty damn funny.
