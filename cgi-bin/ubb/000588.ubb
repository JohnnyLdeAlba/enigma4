Im tired of seeing all the cool people leave and though psysonic seems like a little bitch hes not he was a big influence to me and my website and if it wasnt for him arkonviox.com wouldnt be how it is!<p>Psysonic i do owe you a long awaited apology too I am sorry a chased away silverfin one of the coolest guys that was here and im sorry i turned your home here into a destructive war zone. But i want you to take me as an example and that if this ever happens again with some newbie that you can be like how i am and prove that if one person is cabpable of destroying a website another is cabaple of saving it.<p>Blackfin i have to say you have the best ecco website of all times which still stands over mine i been following your example for a long time so i may still try to chat with you somtimes in the chatroom and get some advice but this time i wont backstab you but maybe help contribute somehow that i can!!<p>I hate good bye messages cause i can never seem to follow them i estimate that i will be back in ten months or about the time ecco 2 is relased cause thats when this place will be rolling in business so for the time being i will be at my site hoping for more sucess...<p>eccochick i will see you there and thank you for all that you have done. blackfin thank you for unbanning me im sorry i have to leave so soon cause i rather wait till people begin to forget about me before i can back...<p>This is a hella cool website when ecco 2 is out well see a new era for ecco that people wont believe and i hope to be apart of it so everyone whos out there stop by and visit ha ha had to say it i'll be back in ten months! ...though goodbyes are hard to do and leaving a place your so used to is hard too!<p>-Arkonviox<p><P><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0" HEIGHT="20"><TR><TD WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BACKGROUND="http://www.arkonviox.com/objects/menu/topleft.gif">&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="20" BACKGROUND="http://www.arkonviox.com/objects/menu/top.gif">&nbsp;</TD> <TD WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BACKGROUND="http://www.arkonviox.com/objects/menu/topright.gif">&nbsp;</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH="400" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="20" BACKGROUND="http://www.arkonviox.com/objects/menu/left.gif">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="#000000" WIDTH="360"><P><CENTER><marquee><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;A man doesn't automatically get my respect.

And when you visit around 12+ MB's (Like Me), leaving is something you can't do at all very well...<p>Still, see ya in 10 months!
