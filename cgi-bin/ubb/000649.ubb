When we tried to run it, the moniter went crazy. It made horrible high-pitched whining noises and the screen is wacked up. It looks like the true image, the correct image, has been duplicated and lined up across the screen in a flickering mess. You can still move your cursor and play the game, but its impossible because you cant tell which is the real image and the real cursor. It takes forever just to exit. Now, not only does the hunting game do this, but now all my games do this, except minesweeper or solitaire or ither games like that. I think the hunting game's software somehow corrupted my video card. If it did, I dont know what to do about it. If not, well...?????? Anyway, Blackfin or anyone else, HELP!

The problem isn't caused by the games but by your monitor... I know that when I go to 640*480 screen resolution my monitor also does high-pitched noises until I move and turn it for some time... At 800*600 and 1024*768 screen resolution everything is fine! I guess it is caused by the cable that connects the monitor and the computer.<br>But I think your problem is also the monitor. I guess everytime you start a game the resolution changes so that your monitor makes that wierd noise and the lines. Maybe you can find out how you can change the screen resolution in your games and game manuals... Hope that helped<p><i>*BTW: I'm healthy again... sort of... still got a cough, but it's much better than the last weekend...

Cortex, it was Ted Nugent's hunting adventure or challenge or something...we managed to get it to work on our grandparents computer and it was so awesome...especially if you only wounded an animal and it would turn on you and kill YOU.
