Z||000000||dragonboy||11-21-2000||12:54 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||music is just as important as graphics, gameplay, etc.  If a game does not have good music, its not as enjoyable to play as it could be.  I love many different tracks from video games that i actually just listen to them and not play.  and even some of this music arise some strong emotional feelings in me too. i think game music composers have to give the music an emotionl feel so that the gamer feels more "one" with the game.  I love most of the music to the ecco games, sega cd ecco 1, 2 and dotf(i forget ecco jr's).  anyways, i prefer music that has no lyrics, just the instrumentation itself, that way i can imagine what the song means in my own way.  but some lyrical songs are good, like luna's in lunar<IMG SRC="crookedsmile.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="crooked smile">ss and the intro song. hey debaser, do you have the playstation versions of final fantasy 5 and 6?  after you beat the game, it allows you to see 2 full-motion videos of the finl fantasy characters.  and that song that rosa sings (name i think) in the music hall is beautifully composed in the backset of that.  if you don't have that, you have to see it.  well anyways that's my opionion on video game music. silver shares the same viewpoint on this as I too.

You are soooo right! Music is such an important thing in my life, that it becomes an important factor in, not only video games, but movies, and everything else for that matter! Those of you who know me in the chat room, know where I stand on music.....<br> <IMG SRC="http://animfactory.com/animations/music/notes/goldnote_sm_clr.gif">
