But this one just REALLY disgusts me : The killing of whales and dolphins in Japan, and how it seems to be picking up dramatically lately. And not just the killing of them, the <i> eating </i> of them.<Br> <Br> They showed some footage on the news : Hundreds of dolphins being netted and beaten to death, and then sold for someone to munch on. Good grief, there's not enough other things to eat that you have to go kill creatures almost as intelligent as humans and feast on them ? It makes me sick. And it's not an easy death, either. I won't go into that. <Br> <Br> Many cultures have hunted whales, which is bad enough. But the dolphin hunting goes too far. These are intelligent creatures, with emotions.Thinking animals. They are <i>not </i> your noonday sandwich.<Br> <Br> SOme of them say it's their proud tradition, and as such should go on as ever. But someone's proud tradition could be headhunting ; you wouldn't expect them to go out and continue. It's time to face what year we are living in, people : The year 2000. We don't eat whales and use their bones for corsets. Get over it, and find something nicer to eat than something that has a language and recognizes shapes.<Br> <Br> Sorry, I just really needed to let that out....*Sighs*<Br>

Whales are intelligent too!!!<br>Whales are at a better risk of being extinct then dolphins are. The Japanese people are disgusting, refusing to stop killing whales and dolphins. Sooner or later there will be no whales and dolphins and fish to hunt then what are they gonna do. I wouldn't be surprised if they start eating each other!!!

People down in Korea kill dogs by torturing them first because they think that makes them taste better!!! They stick about 4 or 6 dogs in a tiny crate and let them sit there for days!!!! Isn't that terrible!!! Whales are being killed with explosive devices on their harpoons!!! Dolphins are being killed in drift nets. Sooner or later humans are going to drain this planet and maybe take over other planets in the future just like the Foe <br>and the Vortex!!!

Read <i> "Animal Liberation" </i> if you want to learn more, it's horrendous.<Br> <Br> Veal is, of course, made by taking a tiny calf and putting it into a tiny living space where it can't move. For most of its life it's in a space so small that it cannot lie down or turn around. Then when they're big enough, they are taken off and slaughtered. Lovely. And animal research is worse. It's enough to make you turn to vegatarianism. <br> <Br> But I really REALLY hate to see them torturing these dolphins and whales. It's not fair.....*sighs*...I'm glad the U.S is going to put a blockade on Japanese fishing boats in American waters because of this. I'm not fond of my country, but for once they've made a smart move.<Br>

Z||000006||Eao||10-16-2000||09:04 AM||collprin@warwick.net||ya.  The Eskmo ppl are allowd to hunt whales, as part of tradition.  Just as there ancestors did, they go out into the ocean, on a heavy duty motor boAT and use a bomb inplanted into it's blow hole.....*waaa* they say, "we need to do this, our anstors did"<p>i say, i tell ppl, that.hey wait a minut!<br>My ansestors were Vikings?  Does that mean i have premission to raid villigas?  North America is mine! srew Christopher Columbus!<p>yeh.....there are differnt thihs in th sea or land to eat..it's also like the killing of lions for man hood, or all the wolves in the west to save one damn cow and snot nosed 2 yr old...or all the pumas because some stupid toddler was allowed to take a walk in the forest alone and look yummy and an easy target for a kitty.  Oh no!  kill 'em all!<p>hmmm.i say we band togher and say our races's ansestors are allowwed to kill thouuse we dunt like..uh..our god says so...like those morons who haffta to have 20 kids.<p>Eao-posting from skool

My ancestors were Celts,  <i> now </i>  can I go sacrifice a few people to the moon god ? Goodness gracious, I'm all for keeping tradition alive, but there's a happy medium. And don't even get me STARTED on ranchers. Frooding bastards. Wolves are my favorite animals, and if I hear ONE more time how they're gonna eat the kids I will scream. Wolves do not eat children, they never have and I doubt they will in the future. So SHUT UP. Christ they make me mad.....<Br>
Z||000008||Coral||10-16-2000||04:00 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  More people get killed by domesticated dogs than wolves and how come they don't say "Duh...let's kill dogs!" Like Buddy said, the human race may kill all life of earth and take over another planet or something, that is if people can figure out how to go to other galaxies and stuff. In maybe the next millenium people will probably have destroyed everything including whales, dolphins, and wolves!!! Thank God I won't live to see that!!!
Z||000009||Eao||10-16-2000||06:04 PM||collprin@warwick.net||deb, i diddn't meen to word it as if i say "wolfie is gonna eat my kid"<p>i know they don't......unless u have a zoo wolf and some ground 2nd grader burgers and put it in a bowl........<IMG SRC="smilie35.gif" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100 BORDER=0 ALT="dead">  yummy.......erf

Z||000011||dragonboy||10-18-2000||02:38 AM||returner8@hotmail.com||Nothing pisses me off more than when people say that God has given animals to us to do with as we please, including senseless massacres.  I personally believe that all life on this planet has an inherent spiritual nature underlying their physical being.  Knowing this as part of my own spritual deveklopement, I try to doa ll I can to help other living beings other than humans.  I know it sounds stupid, but sometimes i save the spiders and bugs mt dad's about to smash and take them outside.  Anyways, i have seen a number of dolphin/whale/seal/etc slaughters, and It just rips into my soul so much, I am affected for days, and whwnever tha thought arises.  And to eat something as special as a dolphin, I cannot begin to describe my disgust.  Humans wil learn someday, but at what price.....?
