Get the first brand and go to the generator room. You know the dolphin you talk to who leads you to the Machine controls? Good, but did you know you can slap him all around and he won't care? He also can't die! Just bust his tail over to the exit door! It works! You don't need to get the second brand or fix the machine or anything! In the next level you'll already have the second mark.<p>Hanging Waters(my favorite level): This is in the second pool with the bouncing bubbles.
