They must be 60x60 size pixel.<p>To coral: write thes at the begining of what you right all the time to have a pic near your name, i suggest you save this onto a word pasd to remmember.

It would be kinda hard to put all that detail into a 60X60 pixel picture. Its soo tiny, i could either do a face, or a drawing, the only prob i got wit da drawin is it'll take sum time B4 he could get it, and the face pic like yers only takes 5 min or less.

(there's another forum I go to that has this shitty EZCode thing goin' on, and my sigs never, ever work...)<br>Here's the explanation... <IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/clover_sweets/eclipse.jpg">  this is Eclipse, my dolphin character from like grade 4. Don't laugh, I drew her on the computer in my paint program because I have no scanner and I wanted to draw her myself (NO OFFENSE, BLOODFIN. Your drawings look amazing! I just decided to draw her myself, is all. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ) I decided to remove the yin yang symbol from her head because, quite frankly I don't think every dolphin that's 'special' should have a symbol on his or her head (not that there's anything wrong with that! I'm just tired of it, is all... I do like the symbols, though...).<br>So, the story is... she's my faithful dolphin that will tag along with me wherever I go in here, and you can tell her what you tell me, okay? <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Z||000054||blackfin||10-11-2000||01:07 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Thanks bloodfin, I'm not really much of a person to talk about artistic things, I can't really think of a way to make a head picture stand out, but I actually had my own icon I designed for my self awhile ago but I could never draw it up nicelly enough for me to like it.  What it basically was, is a picture of a black dolphin's fin sticking up into the air through the waves.  (my email signature is a rather bad ascii representation of it)  You could try drawing that if you wantsomething that looks different, but a plain head picture would be cool as well.

It looks as powerful as mine> Bloodfins truley a good artist!!! I'm glad to have him apart of my team, otherwise my ecco story wouldnt be so great, especial since I dont have much of a story, but I plan on adding new stuff for next week maybe two more levels new pics-maybe! which I can post up here to show off <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> hey I'm not an artist but I express what I want and my brother the master artist brings them to life! And to everyone progress on my games coming along good everynight I study to leanr how it's done and it's not too hard but not easy. <p>Once the fan fict games of me blackfin and coral come out there will be something great for everyone, and I doubt anyones will be better since I think everyones got good ideas. One thing I have is determination, I wont give up until I'm satified so if your one of those who have you doubts dont I will do it, and prove I put alot of work into this ultimate project of mine. <p>I would like to introduce chracters in my game people might not know of. Arkonviox who everyone knows and loves j/k and as you all know he is NOT the main chracter in fact he has a little part and is nothing supremely great. <p>All I will say arkonviox is an old world dolphin atlantean, his kind! who where later replaced by a new race called alpha dolphins. He was a hero of atlantis and savior, the one destined to defeat the dark whale empire. Ecco the dolphin is destined to defeat his newest rival the vortex king! There are other major chracters like crestoe who lives in the sunken city Tantalus along with his fellow dolphin race who have the ability to breath underwater - no I didnt copie this idea from DOF in fact I came up with it first! <p>Theres Delta a dolphin expiereince with technology. Clondike eccos side kick (a young orca) Torrello who clings to clindikes back. Dazer a wise whale from the future whos the desendant to Big blue, Darkfin the desendant of blackfin. <p>Ecco jr (ecco's son). and others I just cant remember Oh yeah and apacalypes the great dark whale a god to the seven dark wales. Thorax the dark whales leader. Battino also the dark whale who joins ecco and is clondikes brother. and more!<br>I think a character description will be much better or a chracter bio!<p>
Z||000065||Histronic||10-12-2000||09:07 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Sounds like a great story!  But, I think Ecco Jr.'s name should be changed.  he might be confused with a certain game of the same name.  Not to mention it is unoriginal.  Aside from that, with a little editing, the story could be wondeful.

If you look close at it, its hafe of the razor back worthog or whatever face. Thats why hes not wearing ah miami dolphins helmet, it was a good idea for his return pic!

And another thing, I will do your face pic, but as it would seem, you doubt me, and i dont take that. So tell me what it is you want!
Z||000073||Charisma||10-14-2000||10:31 PM||kailin79@hotmail.com||Actually Bloodfin,<br> I don't doubt YOU. I doubt myself. What I meant by screwing it up is that I won't be able to download it.<br> And you're right. I don't know too much about Ecco. But as I said, Coral's lending me Ecco 1 and 2. So I hope to learn some stuff.<br> If you want to design my face pic, then here's a description: a dophin with a full "grin", navy blue, with a weird-looking spot on her forhead.<br>    Thanks<br>
