I think I did something wrong, because the dolphins all say the same thing as they did when I first visited.  Not to mention the fact that the rocks are still there, though before I went to Entrapment, I brought food to the village.<p>Here's what happened.  When I first visited, I left the level via going in the fish's mouth.  I rescued the dolphin in entrapment, and I led him back to the way i came in.  He says it's not safe for him to go back to the village, and he gives me the song of the plant.  So I got past the stinging vines.  Now, the IGN.com FAQ is the only one there that describes Anguish Again in detail, and I think its wrong.  It says there is a big bay of sharks as soon as I swim out of the stinging vine area, and there isn't.  What did I do wrong?<p>On another note, how do you put pictures in front of your posts?

I've never envountered this bug myself but from what I have heard it seems to be caused by turning you dreamcast off between finishing Entrapment and returning to Agony or dearth.  You will need to replay Entrapment and then play Agfony of Dearth straight away and hope the sharks are there this time.
