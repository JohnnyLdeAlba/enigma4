Z||000000||PsySonic||05-17-2001||03:04 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||Hello guys, I got a big question about a big decision and I want to listen to all of your comments, especially Arkons and Blackfins cause it's mostly of their concern.<p>I think the devision of the Ecco community into both of these sites (The Undercaves and Arkonviox.com) is and has always been a problem for all of us. It was mostly the reason of the wars because there were always tries to get as many people on ones (Arkonviox'/Blackfins) forum as one could. I know that this caused trouble many times and both of the guys have admit that. I think we need to solute that problem as soon as we can because I know that if we don't the next "war" will come soon.<p>Well, how do we solute the problem then? The only answer for this is that the Ecco community has to be connected into one place, not two like now. We have now two forums and two main chatrooms. The problem is that (also since the war should be over now) the same people will visit two chatrooms. That will make again groups of people who dislike others, who search for people to nitpick them and flame them again. I know the problem will not be solved at all when we connect the group again, but it will help it and prevent bad happening like before. The most recent one should have shown us best! This decision will finally connect the sites, the community can go to one place, newbies will know about both of the websites as soon as they go to the interactivities of the sites (if not even before). Wars won't easiely happen anymore and the webmasters could work more on their sites.<p>I got two suggestions how to solve this problem.<br>#1: Blackfin and Arkonviox decide whose forum and chatroom will remain, but of course both of them should remain being administrators. Both websites will link to the same forum and chatroom so people can go to that place. But I know that Arkonviox and Blackfin have many different points of views and it won't be easy for anyone of them to close their forum/chatroom and/or host it on one of their websites. But still, this would be a very good solution and it won't be a loss for anyone of you webmasters.<p>#2: Someone else than Arkonviox and Blackfin of this community will become administrator of the forum and chatroom. Maybe even two administrators for each the forum and the chatroom. That has/have to be of course (a) very trustful and impartial person(s) cause it won't work else. We could even start an online "election" who it should be if there will come enough requests. The forum and chatroom could be hosted on a completely different server/dot.com/website or be placed on one of Arkonviox'/Blackfins websites. But in any case, we shouldn't have more administrators/moderators, and of course Arkonviox and Blackfin have to promise that they won't do anything to the chatroom and especially to the forum, cause it won't be of their concern anymore.<p>I know, this might sound utopian or illusial, but I wanted to say this and wanted to hear of you what you think about it. Please tell me, I'm very interested in it and it is of our concern, for ALL OF US! If you just think, bleh, that's all  **** , it's OK with me, but don't say I didn't warn you about it, I know if we don't deal with this soon, there will come another war in the near future.<p>I posted this on both forums, the Arkonviox.com Forum and the Undercaves forum. Please tell US your thoughts!<p>>> PsySonic

I used to run a huge fanfiction website called Arcana, which was the biggest and best on the Net before FanFiction.Net with its paid-for resources... *sigh* Anyway, there was a long-standing rivalry between Arcana (mainly devoted to NiGHTS fanfiction) and a NiGHTS-only website called Alethea's Nightopia. It actually started over religion--she was a born-again Christian and objected to some things in my NiGHTS fanfiction. <p>Anyway, it only ended when Nightopia went dead. It caused a longstanding rift in the NiGHTS community, with "Alethea's lot" on one side and "the Archivers" of Arcana on the other. In fact, we're still more or less divided, at least those of us who remain now that NiGHTS is so long gone. <p>I'd hate to see that sort of thing happen to Ecco, simply because there aren't enough people here for it to happen. But, no matter what, Arkonviox and the Undercaves ARE rival sites and will remain so. I know from past experience that getting webmasters to work together is very difficult. <p>What I would suggest is that Arkon and blackfin try to work together on some sort of joint project that would help the whole Ecco community. There were some good suggestions aired about an Ecco webring (Though I'd say don't use the former webring.org but try Ringsurf or something - ANYTHING! - else). It'd be easy enough for both of them to be administrators on a webring, and that would provide a simple way for Ecco fans to find all the sites around. <p>There, that's my two cents. Feel free to ignore the newbie now ^^;;;

I own a webring from webring.com and all it is i think is just a lame version of the directory project!<p>But a joint together on a project is somthing i belive would bring owr sites together and it wouldnt hurt to have another person begin the "next" big Ecco website i don't think blackfin ever anticipated my growth into a functional community i dont think anyone did not even myself and the problem i created was the curse of the webmaster having to make all the people happy!

I agree that to a certain level the two websites are rivals and always will be, that isn't bad, what is bad is if it gets nasty and we need to watch that, a small amount of rivalry is good it brings out the best from both websites.<p>I didn't think Arkon would become a big community quite yet you have grown fast, I think part of that was helped by the wars, many people visted your website because of them, and enjoy yourself Arkon, I garantee it won't be long untill you find yourself being flammed for your hard work, I renember the first DoF guide I was trying to make from different newsgroup posts before I got the game, I got a few '***** you and your **** sucky guide' emails after the game faq's guide went up, even though I'd made it very clear that I was trying very hard without the game.<p>I'm still not so sure about what we could do for a joint project, I still like the idea of a monthly ecco fan email newsletter (I mentioned it in another post) but we need more people and news before it would be really worthwhile.

They are not total opposites, therefore, no attraction, if you get what i mean. You two will always be at odds. However, we can work together diplomatically just as two nations can work together for the greater good. United we stand, divided we fall. First of all, the forums themselves...no offense Blackfin, but i like Arkon's better because i can express myself as freely, and yes as rudely as i wish. On the otherhand, Arkon's chatroom wont load on my computer, so i have to use Blackie's. So even though there are two different site's with a forum and a chatroom each, it still works out for people, even in my odd case. 
Z||000006||blackfin||05-19-2001||12:46 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||There is a difference between freedom and Chaos Vantid, I don't think you were here for it but a while a ago a good friend called Silverfin left in part because people expressed themselves as they wanted without thinking.  I'm not trying to stop and restrict people, I'm happy for people to say what they want as long as they think of what it will mean to other people and how it will effect them and don't say it natier than they have to.  That is what I'm trying to encourage, I don't want to lose anymore friends over it.  Some people don't say anything if they are being hurt by things untill it just builds up and they snap and leave, I don't want that happening here, I'm sorry I know it is annoying but I feel if I step back and let people do what they wish certain people will simply be driven off the forum and the website and I don't want that....<p>As for peace I think that is achieveable now, again I don't think you were here for when it started Vantid but all the wars started because of me being with Megz, that is over now so a big flash point has been fixed, and I'm not as far from Arkon as it may appear, if you could see me several years ago you'd see somebody like him, I've just managed to get better control of my anger than he has and I've had different things in my life but deep down we are in someways similar, and we both share the common goal of making a great ecco website.  Arkon is finally learning that I'm not in here to compete, I just want to do the best I can, as long as people don't get nasty if he makes something better than mine I don't mind (Working for weeks on something and then being told you suck and are a loser because somebody else has made something just slightly better is not exatlly nice) but everytime Arkon goes forwards I will be the first to be happy, the more he does the more certain the future of the ecco community is, once there was just my website so if something had happened to me it would have probally killed the ecco community, now there is his website as well so if something ever happens to the other the community will survive ^_^
