A||||2||Trace Kyshad||Epilogue Theories...
Z||000000||Trace Kyshad||10-24-2000||04:54 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Ok, I'm guessing some peeps here have already talked about this, but I wanna shot at it ^^<p>At the end of Ecco 2, Ecco is said to disappear forever in the tides of time yeah? The thing is, the DoF, he seems to arrive, (And unless there's something metioned later on in the game I haven't reached yet) there's no mention of how he got there.<p>So would it be that, he got lost in time, and the Ecco who appeared at the beginning of DoF, is the Ecco from years ago just after following the Vortex Queen?<p>But then, when is DoF set? Many many years after the first two I'm guessing (No mention of the Vortex, humans and dolphins living together etc. I realise this is all fiction, but a year difference between Tides of Time and DoF would be nice ^^)<p>So, The Guardian... How was he created, If that gets mentioned in the game too, don't tell me, ignore that question.<p>So, my theory goes that Ecco get's lost in the tides of time, and drops into the far future just in time to see the Guardian's demise, but what happens between these two moments, does he go anywhere else? Is this an idea for a fanfic? Help!<p>Anyway, I'd juts like to hear what you think happens/happened
