Z||000000||Ally28||11-25-2000||11:57 AM||goldens86@aol.com||Hey everyone!!! I just bought Ecco The Dolphin for Sega Dreamcast yesterday and I love it!! It is such a beautiful and realistic game!! Ok, now to the point of my post~ I just got to Level 2, got the Great White shark trapped in the hole, and got the power of vigour.. so what do I do now? I was reading a walk through that is available on this website and it says to go back to where the dolphin is chasing the fish, and in the center there is a route blocked off by rocks.. and at the end there is supposed to be a power of vigour thingy.. Well I think I found the right power of vigour thingy, but then the walk through says " swim as hard as you can to the bright light" ?!?!? I have yet to see a bright light !! LOL.. someone please help me.. thanks <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
