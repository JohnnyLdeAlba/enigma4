Z||000000||dolphingirl||02-11-2001||11:48 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||It seems that there is a problem with the UBB code/HTML tag for trying to add an image. Either that...or I'm going crazy! Here's what I've figured out...since your post today where you used the 'idea' smileys (noticed you fixed the size on it), so far I'm the only one who's tried to post an image. I know I'm typing it correctly (and I've tried both the UBB code and the HTML tag, at seperate times)...but it's just not working right! Is it possible that something got messed up when you fixed the size for 'Mr. Idea'...? I'm reaching for an explaination...yes...I know...but I'm stumped! Looking at the posts where I've attempted to post my face pic...it looks nothing like what I really typed! I'm confused... <IMG SRC="confused.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="confused"> ...please help...?!?!
