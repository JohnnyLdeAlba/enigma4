Try it! Its weird! Here's how I did it. I attacked the Sentinal Mover and then talked to him, then I went to go see Pilot and talked to him. I didn't follow him into the pipe and waited for him to return and then charged at him. I followed him all the way to the end and the Prime Mover was ticked off that I had "Challenged" her son Pilot. The dialouge stays the same from there on out. Neat though!
