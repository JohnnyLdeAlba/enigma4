Z||000021||blackfin||05-27-2001||07:47 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||There are no newsgroups dedicated to ecco but I may make one once the fan base builds up a bit more but right now there are several newsgroup just about dolphins in general, I'm betting that most of those people have never heard of ecco and we may just get some more fans if they get introduced about it, but I can't just barge in there, they will just think that I'm a annoying spammer and ignore me or even flame me, what I'd need to do is just join the group and be a member of it first, but I don't really have time for that right now, just these ecco forums suck up enough of my time, I have to be up past midnight often to find time to post on them (like now)
Z||000022||Arkonviox||05-27-2001||12:45 PM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/av/huarkon.jpg"> <br>Dolphin groups is a good start i tried all last night to find another ecco communitylike game faqs i came across one new forum dedicated to ecco but no ones been there since december. i check on it in case someone pops up but i could bardge into dolphin groups and assimilate them to ecco np for me!
Z||000023||yogoat||05-27-2001||10:30 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||No, no, no...and NO!  Blackfin, this is yet another reason why I'm above you (well, not really, but I have a good idea!).  Just go in there, and say something like, "Hey everyone.  I see how interested you are in dolphins, so I should suggest playing a video game where you actually play as a dolphin!  you get to...blah blah blah...and even fight blah blah blah!  I think you'd really like this, because it makes me feel like a dolphin, and sometimes my heart even speeds up when a shark surprises me!  If you want to check out more, or possibly get this game, please go to my website: www.ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz.  thank you for your time." and that's it!  Just make it sound like you care, and they'll care.

Z||000025||blackfin||05-28-2001||07:59 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Correct Arkon, Image that somebody turned up out of the blue and posted a message saying visut my website and then vanished, how likely would you be to take a look?  Then imagine a person who had been on the forum for months and had been very helpful made the same post, how likely would you be to visit that website then?  You can't just barge in, you need to be a member to do things like that or they are hust ignored as mindless spamming, if you have never been to a place before and just barge in with advertising it is spam no matter what you say.  Most people on usenet and used to messages like you described yogoat that are sent out to every newsgroup on the net, they will just think it is another one, the only way to get attention is if the post comes from a respected member.
Z||000026||yogoat||05-28-2001||10:22 AM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||Oh, no they won't.  Okay, then, so don't post your website url!!  Just post a link to an emulator and an Ecco rom.
Z||000027||blackfin||05-28-2001||04:46 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Roms and emulators are just going to confuse most non technical people, it would take forver to explain them and people won't read an email that long.

Z||000029||blackfin||05-29-2001||02:43 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I would doubt that they could but I'd love for them to try, the more ecco websites the better. ^_^

Z||000031||blackfin||05-31-2001||08:08 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Good point, but we could always try and convince such a webmaster to get a 'real' website <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge">
