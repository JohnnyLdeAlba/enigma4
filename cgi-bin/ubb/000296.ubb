Z||000000||Coral||10-27-2000||07:38 AM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  At Arkon's site Yogoat wrote this:<p>"I mean Crestoe's pictures rock the party but<br>                          everything else sucks Arkon I'm gonna ban you next time<br>                          you come in the chat your hella gay and your sites gay!"<p>Notice the "I'm gonna ban you next time you come in the chat"? I copied and pasted it. If you don't believe me check out Arkon's forum and click on Yogoat's nasty topic.

Z||000002||Histronic||10-27-2000||09:17 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Whoops.  Nevermind.  I just read some other posts about Yogoat and by Yogoat.  He seems like the kind of person who would do that.

Z||000004||dragonboy||10-27-2000||06:50 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||well he swore (gave his word) that i could...ahh i'm dropping this subject from the forum, you all know how egocentric he is at times.  and althoiugh that "brother" thing is possible, i know goat talks like that to arkon.
