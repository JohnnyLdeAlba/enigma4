My pimp, yogoat, told me about this place...Yogoat's so cool, and his fifteen inches of fury is the best...If you're asking about my face pic, that's me at the Yogoat Convention--all of the best pimpette-wannabes went there, and they all competed to be yogoat's pimpette..so, I won, and I had my friend take a picture of me while chained with yogoat's chain of honor!!  I hope everyone likes yogoat because he is the best.  Please be my friend.

I thought you were friends? <br>Now I think goat IS going a bit too far, but thats the way he is...I sure hope he doesn't treat his girlfriend that way *shudders at the thought*.<br>It just seems like almost everyone's in a bad mood. I can understand why Arkonviox is but I don't feel like typing a whole lot right now.
Z||000009||dolphingirl||03-09-2001||01:28 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com|| <IMG SRC="http://arkonviox.com/fp/2dolphingirl.jpg">  I'll admit that even I think yogoat went a bit crazy doing what he did... <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="roll eyes"> ...afterall, he used the face pic I always use! However, with this "going a bit too far" thing, I would think that certain people would understand that...as they sometimes go a bit too far as well. If you really get to know 'goat, you'll find out that this is just a running joke with him, and it probably always will be. And, by the way, he doesn't have a girlfriend (anymore), and if he did, as much as he might say he'd treat her like that...he wouldn't. The more you get to know someone, the more you understand them.

Why not just copyright all of your face pics..a
