I remember me drawing Sonic in 3rd and 4th grades, heheh, my classmates were both, joking and impressed in those days ;P Anyway, I put a try on it again and I dunno... Maybe I should try to make a colored picture, too <i>*shrugs*</i>. Here my first pic of "me" comes:<p> <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/fanart/psysonic_profile_bw.jpg"> <p>Hope ya like it...

Well, I had this idea in history lessons, you sure can find out why it had to be history lessons ;P <i>*bleh*</i> Well, I only had maths paper when I started with the pic, and it was actually only a try... I was impressed by Richard Elson's artwork in STC, Reptyx and Trace can you tell why, since they know now some of his Sonic comics *g*<br>I might try and do some other pics in future... <i>*shrugs*</i>
