The Beta ROM isn't mine, I'm also only the finder of this ROM but I'm not the one who has the real cartridge and transported the data to computer (however that is possible *shrugs*).<p>I'm the last one who cares about what you all do with this Beta ROM <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
