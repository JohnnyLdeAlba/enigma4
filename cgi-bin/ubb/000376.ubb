This beggining promisses a great saga of whales. And what you mean saying "Now maybe my story can continue"?? It큦 original. You must to continue it.

Go take a look.<p>And I meant I'll only write more if it's wanted. If it's not read, then there's no purpose, really.<p>But I'm still working on the Whale one too. Don't you worry abvout that. I have a stack of fanfics to occupy me, and I won't abandon any of them.
