I then decided to roll the credits and i noticed there were much fewer japanese people than in other games.  that was surprising.  also i fell asleep listening to the different tracks of dotf and awoke to it.  it was pretty cool<br>

There was on the middle of a dialog in a shinra base. Well, that is the only one time it happened to me. And I just continued playing without getting out of the bed... why not?

(I had to it was the only way I could find enough time to update the site with everything else I'm currentlly doing)  I almost fell asleep with ecco music blaring in my ears but not quite, some how I managed to get into bed before collapsing...
