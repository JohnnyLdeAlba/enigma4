Z||000000||Eao||09-20-2000||08:13 PM||collprin@warwick.net||yup......from 5ish to 8 i made this crazy thing...some things are simi correct and some are just strange.<p>cco 2 Beta level listing<br>Starting with opeaning level, the reason i say this is because on differtn levels or loaded saved states they change.  Example, if you load the "moray abyss" saved state and try to get to level select 15, you'll get a 3d stage.<p>Level select 0.  stage name Dosent have a password screen.  Notes: this is the Asterite's home, but no one is there, possibley some visibe unreachable globes, you get a "second life" if you drownd.  many glitches happen here, on your sonar map an invisible<br> enime lurks once, and you can swim threw rock, if this happens, the incial globes will dissipear.<p><br>Level Select 1.  Stage name . Notes: this is the globe holder of the dark vortex future, its "arms" are not transpatent but a pretty silvery color.  You have your air bar showning, but do not need it.  When you sonar the thing it's shape contorts.  It'll find footing after a while form being slaped around.<p>level select 2<p>Level select 3.  Stage name Third stage.  Notes:  this is the ancestor of "two tides" in which Trella finds you and drags you to the future.  There is a mini glitch here, in which an invisivble barrier blocks any way to the exit, squirming around may fix this.<p>3d stage.  Pink one.  Brings you to Level selcet 13 (moray abyss)<p>Level select 4.  Stage 4- Notes:  follow the dolphin to the current his/her presance makes it weaken.(home bay?)<p>3d stage<p>Level select 5 Stage name forth stage.

Notes:  an easy level in which you build your good 'ol pal, the asterite.  the rocks in this level seem to be smooth and not lumpy on the sides.  Real unnatural and spooky.  *with the debug code you can explore regions of space that don't exist..real twilite zone stuff<p>level select 7.  Stage name.  Notes:  the future is good an glymphs are in the air.  Down below the ocean some where there is a useless cave with a crab wall, sonar it to death.  There is a lone dolphin who may want to be followed, doing this will result in nothing.  The Flying Glyphs act as the bubbles do in "sky lands".  Watch out for flying Crabs.  there is a flying pool of water that has an invissable barrier glitch.  this may or may not happen.  Also there are "killer bubbles" you can ram or sonar them to death.   Oh yeh, these crabs fly.<p>Level select 8.  level name.  Eighth stage  . notes:  This is a "good future" level, there  is an orca who shows you the asterites death, she uses spark shaped things to kill him with, not the final version's banana beems.  Go down and you will see a baby orca who moves faster than lightning, follow it  You will be brought to the "Magic Arm's" ancestor.  Do as you would with it and a spiny ball pops out.  There are 4 or so kinds of these things, one kind is ancored onto a rock and has the spiny tail, these give you nothin, one chases you, this the same, only the ones that don't move and are not attached give you balls.  there are the same types, only with whip tails. But wait!  theres more!  there also are "worm" crabs, comunal crabs, in a conga line. *you cannot warp to level 10 from here*<p><br>Level select 9.  Level name  none . Notes: A Good future level, apon arrival the sad music will play.  this is a very large level filled with mazes and underwater trees.  With out the debug code you could not explore it all.  This layout seems to be like the one in "the eye" in the final version. There is a glymph puzzle, you knock them loose with your song and they join togher, lightning strikes and bubbles fly everywhere, Another dolpin appers and talks to you, time warping you too the same place.  do it again and you will warp to the asterites new home.  Sometimes the game will lock ecco somewhere and all you can do is "explore".  this is a glitch i think.  <p>level select 10.
