Z||000000||Delphi||01-02-2001||03:16 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||I found a site a while back called Perfect Zero... it has a whole pile of tracks from the Ecco Songs of Time CD and the tracks from the Sega CD version of Ecco. Uh, now many of you may not be looking for these, but I decided to tell you about it anyway. The URL is  <A HREF="http://204.30.23.21/cgi-bin/ftp-music/ftp.pl" TARGET=_blank>http://204.30.23.21/cgi-bin/ftp-music/ftp.pl</A> <br>Or if that didn't work, I'll just try again.
Z||000001||Delphi||01-02-2001||03:18 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Okay, it worked.<p>When you go there, obviously you'll have to look under 'E'.<p>A word of warning, the download time on the songs is atrocious.
