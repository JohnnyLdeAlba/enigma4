You can try searching with your sonar, she'll look a bit like a dolphin, but green, if I remeber it correctly, but she might not always show up. <br>Take a look in the walkthroughs on this site for a better description.<p>Good luck! ^_^<br>

But, do it close to the rocky wall. You'll soon see a pile of rocks, and one rock is greenish in color (near the ground). Swim through a crack, and there's the baby whale!<p>Or, if you would like...there's an excellent detailed map with another walkthrough at  <A HREF="http://www.Arkonviox.com" TARGET=_blank>www.Arkonviox.com</A> ...check it out! Once at the main page, in the left hand collumn, under Articles, is "Guides". Go there...I think you'll like this walkthrough's map especially!

The site I gave you did a little remodling, so after you click on  <A HREF="http://www.Arkonviox.com" TARGET=_blank>www.Arkonviox.com</A> , you will see "Ecco DOF" under the title, "GUIDES", in the left hand collumn. Okay! Cool...well, I hope you get around to seeing the fantastic job Arkonviox is doing on his walkthrough! Check it out! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
