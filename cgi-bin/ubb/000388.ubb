Red it is... ^^<p>As for the comic, finally! I have seen it all! Can't belive I missed the vortex (Who had legs... hmm), Megadroid kept blessing us with his translations (Which changed company between issues) but all in all it was pretty good.
Z||000008||PsySonic||11-16-2000||04:28 PM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <br>Trace, I also really wondered about the Vortex. They look and act very humanoid... But it was a quiet good interpretation, they looked even more scary by this.<br>Hehe, MegaDroid is really a funny guy <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000009||Debaser13||11-16-2000||08:29 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||The ending seemed a bit.....adrupt, didn't it? They could've done one more installation....ahh well.
Z||000010||Coral||11-16-2000||08:49 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Yeah, I thought the ending was dumb. They could have made it better. I'll bet the makers were rushing through or something.<br>
Z||000011||PsySonic||11-17-2000||12:29 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <br>Sure, the ending bas a bit adrupt... But it wasn't dumb! From what I know now about "Sonic The Comic" and how other stories (didn't) ended we are lucky to see this one... But you are right, they Vortex compressed together with the Ending of the story into a 5-page-part was really too short. That was maybe because the story was planned to be a 7-part story or so... At least we see how the Asterite has now gone to his home and I actually didn't expect that... A full page panel with Ecco being Underwater with the many Underwater life creatures would have been nice!
