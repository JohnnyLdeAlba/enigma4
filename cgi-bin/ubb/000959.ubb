A||||7||K||VERGE Ecco-type Game Engine
Z||000000||K||07-03-2001||09:50 PM||kschnee@mit.edu||To restate and answer DG (See thread "GURPS Atlantis"):<p>I was fooling with the game creation system VERGE (geared towards RPGs, but versatile) and built part of an action-based, 2D Ecco engine. I didn't bother to give it good graphics yet, but it has:<br>-8 way movement<br>-Dashing<br>-Gravity (when above the waterline, for jumping)<br>-Impassible tiles (imperfect)<br>-Background layer w/ parallax, midground, and foreground layer in front of player<p>If anyone cares, I could work on it some more and add things like an air meter, sound effects, and a character that doesn't look like the Knight from Final Fantasy. =)

I'm making a game <I>engine</I>. I was thinking that if it worked well, I'd post it and let people try making levels. I'll see if I can avoid making the demo boring as hell, though.  <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"> <p>Oh, and it's spelled "savior."
