Z||000000||SilverFin||09-06-2000||03:24 PM||stenellas@yahoo.com||Anybody knows that rumor of some kind of Ecco cartoons used on UK schools for learning first aid skills?<p>I saw it on a console magazine a few ages ago, it was something like "Ecco teachs now first aid on some UK schools. Little children have the chance of blah blah blah..." (i can't remember all). Someone knows? <p>It was the same magazine of the Ecco for saturn pics.

Although one thing to consider is that i don't think we have fans that young on this forum.  Also, i am willing to bet that the work on ecco for saturn probably was used in dotf.  I saw a low-quality picture of ecco some time ago and it did not look like dreamcast material.  Anyway, I just got a saturn here cheap so I could play some rpgs like shining force 3 and such.  it would be cool to play whatever they  did complete for ecco on saturn
