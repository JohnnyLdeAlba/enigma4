Z||000000||dragonboy||11-05-2000||03:24 AM||returner8@hotmail.com||anyone know much abouit the new cube-shaped video game system and its options, speed, etc.  All I know is that there will be a modem, printer ports?, and that a zelda and metroid game are already in developement (working demos, i saw cool screen shots).

There's a bunch of specs here...<p>http://cube.ign.com/news/23962.html<p>I think dolphin was a better name anyway =\<p>X-Crispy<br>

Z||000004||Coral||11-05-2000||01:49 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Most of the Zelda fans that I know like the name Dolphin better than GameCube.<br>I can't wait to have the chance to play that Zelda game!!!! I love the way Link looks in that game!!!!! I just have the urge to kick Ganondorf's @#$ right now!!!!

I think starcube is the proposed new name.
