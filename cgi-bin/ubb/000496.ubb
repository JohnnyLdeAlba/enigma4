Whoever thought of Sailor Moon deserves to be hit with a wet towel, and whoever dubbed should be shot.  No, bullets are too quick for him, he deserves a dull guillotine.

Also, the Japanese don't follow the stereotypes that most people think of when they portray homosexuals.

And by the way...this is the last straw...I've had it! LionHeart, you'd better watch who the hell your yellin at! Don't frickin come here, postin Sailor Moon shit (<i>only</i>-cause that's what you do), then call people here, how'd you put it..."F***ING DUMB", just cause they happen to not like it! Man...heh...you belong on a frickin Salior Moon fan site! Last time I checked, this was an "ecco" fan site! And here you are trying to rack up posts (none of which have to do with ecco), wanting to become a Pod Member...you haven't a clue what that is, do you!? Don't take this as flaming you, that's not what I'm doing, I'm just incredibly sick of seeing a bunch of posts by you, and not'a one has anything to do with ecco...

JUST CUZ I DON'T LIKE SAILOR BOOBIE ART?  I can't believe it.  Just because you like something means everyone has to as well?  You guys should be taking notes.  We wouldn't want Lionheart to think we're dumb!  Speaking of, and pardoning my bluntness, but, WHO THE HELL POSTS ON THE FORUM OF SOMETHING THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT?  That isn't stupid, actually.  It outright doesn't make sense.  Oh, and here's a bet.  I'm thinking that Lionheart doesn't know what Sega is.  Much less owns a DC or Genesis.  Any takers?  None.  I thought so.<p>I will refrain from a flame war, as I know that Blackfin hates those, and I like him, so pissing him off wouldn't be cool.  But I suggest that you go somewhere where Sailor Implants is welcome.
