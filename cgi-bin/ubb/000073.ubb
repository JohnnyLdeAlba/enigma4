A||||4||dragonboy||the songs of ecco versus the play of ecco
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-09-2000||06:30 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||one of the previous posts brought a question to my mind.  What if the music to the ecco games was bad.  How much less would you like the ecco games, if at all?  I bought ecco for genesis the second i heard it was out and I loved it.  then I got a sega cd and decided to rent ecco for that.  I was blown away with its musical score and immedietely bought it that night at a nearby store.  I then sold the genesis one.  Ever since then i have had high expectations for all all folowing ecco games.  Tides of time and DOTF have not let me down.  Bu I am  left to wonder, would I play these games as much if they had bad soundtracks? <br>

(this should be a month off at least though)  In the mean time don't worry about it,  I have seen much worse things on forums...
