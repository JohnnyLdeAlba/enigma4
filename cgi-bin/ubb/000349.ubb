And where do I return the creature when I'm done? I don't plan <br>on coming back here....."  and when he said this a note of defiance crept into his voice   "..........So what would you have me do?"<p>The groom at the counter, a young, harried looking fellow, looked like he had infinitely more important things on <br>his mind -- at least more important to HIM. He gave the customer a condescending look and a curt reply.<p>"I thought everyone knew that. You see that collar on it's neck?" He gestured to the tired looking black Chocobo standing in the straw. It looked <br>like it hadn't been groomed in weeks. Dust and dried sweat coated feathers that, under the right care, would've been glistening ebony, but <br>under the care of South Figaro Chocobo Stables were dull brown from the accumulated debris of several trips. The bird's head drooped <br>low on the long neck, as if the large leather collar that sat astride it were too much of a burden for it to carry. The life of a stable Chocobo <br>was never easy, but this one looked like it had had enough sorrows for every flock on earth.<p>The older man glanced at the chocobo, then gave a short grunt in reply to the query.<p>"Well, that's a shock collar. If the chocobo dosen't come back within an alloted time, I'll just send out a signal and fry a few feathers <br>off his ass. They learn pretty quick after that" the groom remarked with a snicker.<p>The traveller gave a short, barking sound that might have been a laugh and put a worn leather harness over the bird's head. The chocobo made <br>no protest at this, but when the man swung his heavy frame astride the faded black back, it gave a wark of dismay. In return for this small sign of <br>rebellion, the man gave it a vicious kick and jerked on the reins hard. A cluck and another short snap of the reins and off they shot, before the <br>groom could say another word. Through the busy streets of South Figaro, nearly running down a small boy playing on the paved stones by the <br>canal, and out the gate, off into the misty evening horizon. The groom watched until they were out of sight, and muttered to himelf.<p>"With that guy, the animal might as well be returned to the knacker's yard".<p>**********<p>Most towns of any consequence or size had a chocobo stable, but some were better than others. Jidoor, for instance, had one of the best. The <br>rich atmosphere of the town lent itself to all aspects, including the stable, and so the great birds housed there got the best treatment out of all<br>the chocobos on any of the continents. Nikeah came in a close second, as it was a port town and got fresh supplies daily, which kept the animals <br>well-fed and in good health. And Maranda's stable had a kind owner who had actually campaigned for the ethical treatment of stable chocobos. He<br> had been nearly laughed out of town, but continued to work for their better welfare.<br> <br>But of course, not all towns had quality stables. An attempt to run a stable in Zozo had been tried once, but when the 6th chocobo was spirited <br>off into the night, the owners had packed up in disgust and left. And although not nearly as bad as Zozo, South Figaro was one of the worst. It <br>wasn't actually the quality of the town that was to blame; in that sense South Figaro was a lovely town. There were few monsters nearby, it had a <br>small but thriving port, and the scenic placement of it, inbetwixt the coast and a small mountain range, made it a feast for the eyes. No, the <br>main thing that made South Figaro such a bad place for Chocobos were the travellers. The port seemed to attract people whom had either never <br>been near a Chocobo in their life or though of the large birds as tireless modes of transport. And the management of South Figaro Chocobo Stables <br>did nothing to hinder this antiquated way of thinking.<p>The traveller who had rented out the sickly black bird fell into the latter category. He'd already gone through several wild birds caught and broken <br>by his own calloused hands, but the area near South Figaro wasn't good for catching them, so *reluctantly* he'd rented out the unfortunate beast <br>to carry him to Dragon's Neck Collusium, almost three days travel to the northwest. A mountain range, a desert, and a good streach of rocky upland <br>stood between the arena and South Figaro, and the battler didn't plan on slowing down because his mount hadn't been fed in two days. That was <br>the stable's problem. As for him........<p>"Yaaaaaaah!" he shreiked, and kicked the bird from a light trot into a full-out run, the jerky stride of the Chocobo that was instantly recognizible.<Br> <Br> So? What do you good good people think so far?<p><p><br>
