A||||0||dragonboy||return to the future
Z||000000||dragonboy||10-18-2000||03:23 AM||returner8@hotmail.com||what I'd like to know is how ecco can even return to the future after he has traveled back in time.  maybe the time machine creates a "temporal umbilical chord" in a manner of speaking.  after so long, one can will oneself back into the time the traveled from through that  temporal slipstream.  And perhaps this evolved willpower is demonstrated be those future dolphins (Trellia) in TOT. Any other ideas?
