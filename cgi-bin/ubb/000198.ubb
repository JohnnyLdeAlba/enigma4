It would probably take me 1 1/2 day maybe because I never beat Ecco 1 without using level select.

Z||000002||Coral||10-09-2000||09:55 AM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Wait a minute! I didn't even beat DOTF yet and Ecco 1! It would take me over 2 months!

Since I haven't beaten Ecco 2 for a long time without using Codes I guess it would take me 4-6 hours.<p>But that's a good idea to play the good old Ecco games through without cheating, maybe I'll find some time at the weekend <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

I was completely drained after playing dotf for eight hours start to finish.  No i don't do cocaine, i was just kidding.
