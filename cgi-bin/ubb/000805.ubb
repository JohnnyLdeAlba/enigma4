I was trying to figure out whether he was cursing at me.<p>I don't think there's any simple way to make an auto-censor work, since a detector that looks for [swear] with nothing attached will be foiled if someone types ~[swear] or something similar.
Z||000021||blackfin||05-19-2001||12:21 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Quite true K, I've alreadt tried that and it didn't work at all.  I'll have to think a bit more about just how I can make it work.
Z||000022||GTK||05-19-2001||02:13 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||I say leave the filter as it is. It's quite fun, really ^^ *remembers whole days spent on the old Arcana messageboard laughing about the way it censored "h0rny"*

Z||000025||blackfin||05-19-2001||02:48 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I'm working on it, but editing perl scripts takes time, I should have it all done next time I have spare time, I've got holidays coming up in 6weeks, I should be able to spend all that time finishing the things I've been planning for months now, there is no Megz or anything else to stop me this time, I garantee in two months you won't recongize this website, in fact you could say that soon the undercaves will be no more <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

Z||000027||blackfin||05-19-2001||06:18 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||You've seen the script for your forum Arkon, you couldn't even make a change to it.  It's not as easy as it looks working on it, and when I do make changes I have to upload everychange to the site and run it there to test it, it makes things very slow to work on, but I've made a start on face pics and a few other things, if you check the registration page I've actually commented out the html code for the new registration as I accidentally uploaded it and lost the old code before the rest of the forum was ready for it.
