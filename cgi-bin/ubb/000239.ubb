Z||000002||That guy with the hat||10-16-2000||06:51 PM||||That art is incredible. I can draw very well, but I wish I hadn't lost that little section of my brain that reminds me to scan stuff. I might be able to draw that well, but I'm not sure. You are really talented. Does anyone know what happened to that idea of an Ecco coloring book? Anyone? It just kinda' drifted off.<p>Note to self: Find way to make dolphins easier to draw. Prefferably just practice.
Z||000003||Eao||10-16-2000||07:42 PM||collprin@warwick.net||so far *snickers at those animated smile faces* I have about 4 or so drawings and reptyx has given me 1.<p>accetable are<p>missalinaus ecco related pics<br>"story line pics" like ecco visiting trella, or fighting the vortex.<p>the pics should be in Gif format, and sized so when you print them out they will fit the whole page.<p>and ya...i have a shimtload of pics, like my Elfwood gallery, i'll post it again, i'll prolly post again tomorrow...pondering a test run for that wacky bio page.<p>i cannot help my self.....i have to place another face<br>*goes insane and glues a face*<br>:freek5: muahahhaw..i gotta save these animated gifers and use 'em on my page
Z||000004||That guy with the hat||10-16-2000||07:50 PM||||I have a picture for the coloring book thingy. Its that scene from Caverns of Hope where you take the leader dolphin through the narrow caves.

Z||000008||Buddy||10-19-2000||09:02 PM||ntraver@epix.net||How do you get a picture to go on the fanart?<br>Just so you know I have scanner.
