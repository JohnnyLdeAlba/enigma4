I've got a fairly decent demo of my Ecco RPG up here:<br> http://www.geocities.com/gustaffxiii/index.htm<p><br>Please give it a try and tell me what you think. Thanks.

Z||000002||Delphi||12-05-2000||09:30 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Looks very cool!<br>However, I had the same problem as Dragon with the 'invalid archive' thing...

Z||000005||Trace Kyshad||12-06-2000||11:45 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||I'm still working on the engine of mine, I might just rewrite most of it, because Ecco (Technically, wrong name of character, but that's the sprite I'm using) still has a few movement bugs. Still have Charge to implement, along with fish, air, etc...<p>Also, I've been mainly working on the Sonic Engine, which is now almost 100% Perfect now, so it's ben delayed.<p>I'll try the RPG, but from what I hear the Zip's corrupted
Z||000006||Gustaff||12-06-2000||03:23 PM||squall@telusplanet.net||Bah! Stupid Geocities.  I've E-mailed a copy to Blackfin instead.
Z||000007||blackfin||12-06-2000||06:19 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've got the game, it appears from what I can tell only a fraction of the file got uploaded to geocities, the file there was only 300kb, the full zip was 3mb (300000kb), anyway I'll upload it to my server and annonce it on the main page, I've not had time to play it much yet but it looks kewl.

He must be slipping.<br>I hope blackfin updates the site, so i can get this game.  Why don't you move your site to tripod instead?  50 megabytes of space and no restrictions on downloads.

Z||000014||Delphi||12-06-2000||09:29 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Okay, I downloaded and unzipped the game, but here's a stupid question... how do I actually PLAY it? I mean, it unzips all these .bmps (bitmaps) and .wavs... but... where's the actual game?
Z||000015||Delphi||12-06-2000||09:33 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Oh. I got it now... okay, gonna go play it I guess.
Z||000016||Delphi||12-06-2000||09:46 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Okay, I played it. I LOVE IT, Gustaff! The battles are like Phantasy Star 4's, and Ecco is so cute! That is an excellent job, it really is! BRAVO, BRAVO!<br><IMG SRC="smilie41.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rainbow"> <IMG SRC="smilie44.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rolling"><br>
