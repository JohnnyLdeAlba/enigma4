Since I've still not got around to adding Netscape support for certain things this website does look different between Netscape and IE.

Z||000034||dragonboy||11-19-2000||12:23 AM||returner8@hotmail.com||with all due respect, black, that's kind of an ignorant statement.  All of us have viewpoints we find important concerning you and this cool site.  It wouldn't be fair of you to hold these in lesser esteem than those of megs.  As site master you should ideally consider each person's opinion as equal as the next person's.  Showing favoritism only illustrates that your emotions are getting the best of you, and believe me, once you start making small exceptions, they gradually increase until you start making excuses for more absurd things.  I am not rying to make you loo bad, black.  In the past few months I have come to consider you as my friend, and as a friend it is my responsibility to let you know when you are doing something out of the ordinary that's not like you.  i like megs too.  she's fun to chat with her during those times you aren't around, and i can see why you have grown quite fond of her.  But we care about you too, and we don't want to see you start becoming more distant from the rest of us.  Recently I have noticed how you don't seem to talk as much as you used to when you are on chat.  you respond, but its like you are only around to wait for megs to come on, and when she does you guys disappear into person talking the whole time.  Although megs will come back to msin chat every so often to say hi.  I know you don't get very much time to talk with her, but it would be nice if you two would stick around a little longer. Your relationship with her has been forged on this site, as well as the rest of us.  Oh and barbarian, nothing personal, but you should have the same ranks as the rest of us.  after all, i know you much better now <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">.  and for giving megs the pod leader status, i don't really care, but maybe  now that there are two, you should change both yours to like pod king, pod queen.  or pod captain and pod first mate.  something like that.  after all "leader" is more of single position meant for one person.

Do they see the age-gap between them? An 18 year old being interested in a pre-teen kinda worries me. I know not every person in the world is a complete sicko, but it makes you wonder. <p>Personally, I'v never been for online relationships. It will only make both of them sad in the long run, seeing as they cannot be together irl. I have heard of a few rare cases in which the couples actually "did" meet and ended up having a future together. However, New Zealand and Georgia, USA isn't exactly a few steps away, is it?<p>Perhaps i'm just paraniod, but i still say the distance between their age is something to seriously question.<p>Thats my 2 cents. . .<p>An off topic discussion from a new site that i go to now.

Z||000037||blackfin||11-19-2000||01:29 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Look I appreaciate your concern guys, but I've been over this several dozen times with people in the chatroom and my opinion still stands.  I would like to chat in the main room but people constantly make stupid comments which makes having a serious conversation with Megz impossible, I didn't leave to go to private chats because I wanted to but because I felt I had no choice.  I don't mean to neglect everybody else, but I have only a certain number of hours in the day, and I really enjoy my time with megz, I'll try to talk to other people more.  As for the status, well I'm finishing the forum at the end of the year at that time things will be changed around, but I won't do anything till then.   Now Crestoe as for the age gap thing, well Megz I find is quite mature, before she told me her age I thought she was 16...  I recongize that she is quite young, so in consideration I am very careful in my time with her, I don't say anything that I don't think she is ready for.  I know that internat relationships are hard to make work, but I am a person who specialises in doing things people don't believe that he can do, If there is anyway in the world that this relationship can be made to work I WILL find it.

It probably has a little sense to it, that sense being that the older you get, the wiser and more experienced.  and mature...so technically, if blackfin's fine with megs, then age shouldn't be an issue.  if he's okay with her intelligence level, experience, and maturity, then he can be my guest.

This is gonna be my final statement on this subject, but you're being no worse than blackfin (in your perspective).  You're a control freak, people can decide for THEMSELVES.  if they make the wrong decision, it's their responsibility to learn their mistake, not for you to help them if they're this persistent on the subject.  I do think internet relations could work.  it's a little in the dark, but as long as they don't "meet people in the alley on 15th street" it should be fine.  Now, let's all be mature and drop this, and stay out of other people's business and decisions.

Z||000082||vantid||01-16-2001||08:52 AM||||Yikes. That's all i can say. Back to the original topic, here at school i dont get the fishes and dolphins. But at home i do. School uses netscape, home has AOL. Oh, and you dont have to be in computer class to use a computer. im usually in art or biology. <br>ecco 2...the soap opera. Why are they called soap operas anyway?  
Z||000083||blackfin||01-16-2001||06:03 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I'm trying to fix things so they work for Netscape but it's hard, Netscape uses a different set of standards so I have to real start from scratch again.<p>Now they are called soap operas because they are based on the old radio programs that used to be sponsered by the soap companies and they are so over the top they are like an out of control opera.. It's something like that...
