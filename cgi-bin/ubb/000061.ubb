A||||2||dragonboy||another ecco game idea
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-07-2000||08:51 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||Here's another idea:  Ecco RPG.  This game format will follow a lot like an rpg.  There will be armor that will look like the labor harness of varying designs, or even armor that has weapons on it like razors, spikes, and such for devastating dash attacks.  Weapons will be dashing, of course, and technological attachments (built by atlanteans) that turns sonar into lasers and the like.  There could also be "magic" song spells, both black and white varieties.  for the black songs, one would be to control the waters causing a massive air pocket to form surrounding an enemy (like a shark or barracuda would suffocate in the air) or controlling the currents and bashing enemies into each other, possibly a song to turn water into ice spears and such.  White songs would be the healing kind like basic healing, air replenishing, detoxifying, defense raising, you get the picture.  Characters would include other dolphins, orcas, good sharks, atlanteans (how will they look?), dolphin-loving humans, and who knows what else.  As with all RPGs battles must be fought to gain experience and possibly a monetary system of some sort (all right, which one of you out there said clams?!) to buy better gear.  One thing to watch out for is the air level in the lung-based characters  , dolphins, humans, whales, etc.  Unlike the ecco games, the air level will have real time application.  In reality, dolphins can hold their breath for a couple hours depending on their level of activity.  Humans will have air tanks and atlanteans (I think they will appear to be a crossover of humans and dolphins) will have inefficient gills, but will still require breathing apparatus.  Maybe as side quest in the game you could raise fish in an enclosed area.  Here you try to breed or genetically manipulate fish for whatever reason.  The main enemy in the game...I don't know, but it better not be aliens called The Enemy or something like that.  Possibly it will be a race of creatures who dwell at the bottom of the deepest trenches who now want to expand their empire.  They have total control over the lower forms of sea-life, which will form the bulk of the enemy battles.  I have a lot more ideas for this and other games, not just ecco-based ones, so I'll just leave you here with a taste of my mind.  If anyone becomes a  successful video game programmer/designer, don't hesitate to include me.  Appaloosa I'm waiting for your call <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
