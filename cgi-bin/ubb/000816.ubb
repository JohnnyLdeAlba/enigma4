There are notable differences between the EU version (That he was playing) and what Rom I was playing... Maze of Stone never existed for a start... and it wasn't on hard mode, I don't think...<p>Still, I won the race, and that was the first time I'd gone start to finish through that game.<p>I hate Black Clouds as well!
