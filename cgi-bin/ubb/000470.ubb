EVen the Glyphs and the Vortex have been hi-coloured too! WWOOOOAAAAHHII want that! Beats the Genesis any day!<p>And if my German's up to scratch, that looks like the level "The Library", "Ice Zone", "Jurassic Beach" (I'm guessing, Strand is Beach yeah?), etc.<p>

Everything in this game has been recolored and resized and the whole game looks totally pretty! I guess many of you are now greedy for this damn cool game, eh?<p>I actually always wanted this game because I sold once my Mega Drive (now I have it back of course). I searched for it for a long time and never found the actual PC box but I accidently got it with the "SEGA Family Pack" which includes Sonic CD, Baku Baku, Bug! and Ecco PC! And I also never knew that the graphics were improved in the PC version, heck, I didn't even know of the videos! That was a surprise when I played it! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Reminds me of bath time. (runner bait fish, rubber dolphins and sharks, a 'boat' with ppl, and a mermaid and mossasuar) yes, i'm  a strange kid.
