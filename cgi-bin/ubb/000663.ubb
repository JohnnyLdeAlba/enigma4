I know I've not been around very much at all...but...I am now! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"><p>Anyway...ran across this searching the net the other day, and thought I'd share. I know for all you die-hard Sega fans, you may not be happy...for it involvs the PS2. But...deal with it...okay! I'm posting it anyway:<p> <A HREF="http://video.gamespot.co.uk/stories/ps2/previews/0,8325,2473885,00.html" TARGET=_blank>http://video.gamespot.co.uk/stories/ps2/previews/0,8325,2473885,00.html</A> <p>I know it's a really long url...but...again...deal with it! I found it and was like, "is this for real"? The only thing that sucks...is that it looks like it will only be released in the UK, for now anyway (well, doesn't suck for those of you who live over there)! Thought some of you here would find it interesting though! <IMG SRC="smilie38.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="monkey"><p>See ya around...

And I guess not many people knew about that game... It looks quiet nice, although the whale animations seem not to be as smooth as Ecco's and the screenies are only taken from one level... But I guess it will become a nice game.<br>Ack, I hate it that Sega has decided to stop the Dreamcast, now I'm forced to buy another console only to play my fave character's games... I'll have to see on which console Sega will concentrate. Maybe I should just try to win a PS2 like DG did <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><br>Anyway, thanks for the info, DG!

Z||000006||dolphingirl||02-11-2001||09:17 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||I'm not exactly sure, but, I don't believe Ecco 2 and this game have anything in common, other than the guy behind the first ecco, is the mastermind behind it. So, I think they're two seperate things...hopefully anyway?!?! <IMG SRC="smilie20.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="erm">
