I'm not sure if you already knew about that but I thought it might interest you...<p><i>GBA: Dolphin Demonstration<p>The second graphics demonstration of the Game Boy Advance hardware teased with a marine mammal.<p>April 12, 2000<p>Nintendo has a dolphin fixation, it's clear now. First, the company gives the project name Dolphin to its future console. Then the company hands out squishy dolphins at the GDC in San Jose last month. And at the Game Boy Advance Developers Conference, Nintendo showed a dolphin doing its thing on the small screen.<br>The second graphics GBA demonstration (the first being Yoshi's Story) was a simple feat – a side-scrolling ocean with a well-rendered dolphin leaping out of the water through rings. According to sources it was very reminiscent of <b>Ecco the Dolphin</b> on the Sega Genesis. The point of this demonstration was to show off the Game Boy Advance's advance Alpha Blending and lighting tricks, and showing how sprites can be transparent as they're layered on top of one another.<p>Unlike Yoshi's Story, this dolphin demonstration was just a graphics demo and not a real playable game. But who knows, we might be playing with a dolphin even before the next Nintendo console hits next year.<p>-- Craig Harris</i><p>The link to this article is  <A HREF="http://pocket.ign.com/news/17941.html" TARGET=_blank>http://pocket.ign.com/news/17941.html</A> <p><br>That's about it <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <i>*goes back to research mode</i> <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

Z||000009||dolphingirl||06-18-2001||10:44 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Huh...that's some really interesting stuff there Sonic...thanks a bunch for the info. I've got a GBA (given to me as a present) so this news is expecially good to know. As much as the idea of ecco with a plumber is dissapointing (in a way)...it'd still be cool nevertheless (in my opinion).
Z||000010||Riveler||06-18-2001||11:22 PM||riveler@uol.com.br||Oh, what a lucky Dolphingirl!!<br>If I'm not wrong (maybe) your PS2 was given to you as a gift too, right? What about change your nick to Dolphinlucky, Dolphinclover or Rabbitfootdolphin?

You've got quite the memory. Except the PS2 wasn't exactly a gift...I actually won it (a package deal)!?! First time I won anything that big before in my life! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> But the GBA was a present...so yeah...basically yer right...I am pretty lucky aren't I... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"> ...well, make that about some things...heh!<IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well">
Z||000013||PsySonic||06-19-2001||03:01 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Heheh, don't be afraid, I don't think Ecco and the plumber will make it into one game. The is rather supposed to show that Ecco, as a symbol of Sega, and Mario, the symbol of Nintendo are joining... And that Ecco might get a game on a Nintendo console (not only referring to GBA <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> ), maybe even the Gamecube, that'd be cool...<p>Bah, forget about the old fight between Sega and Nintendo, even though we are children of war ([u]not[/u] referring to Arkonviox.com) between those companies, we should rather enjoy that those great ones are merging and doing even cooler games. And Sega will still be Sega, Nintendo will remain Nintendo, so who cares. I don't think we will see Sonic or Ecco next to Mario... Uhhh, at least not in the games <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

Z||000015||GTK||06-19-2001||09:02 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||I argue with a Sega fangirl friend about this all the time. Yes, Mario is scary. But let's be honest--if Ninty is willing to work with Sega and release Ecco games for the GBA, can that be anything except a good thing? It means Sonic and his ilk will go on despite the Dreamcast's demise, Sega games will be available to more people than ever before (meaning that we might actually see this tiny little fandom grow) and Nintendo might actually help Sega make their games better. No offense to the Sega fangirls/fanboys in here, but one thing Sega cannot do perfectly (and Nintendo can) is 3D games. Hands up who HASN'T struggled with the daft set viewpoints in Twinkle Park... 
Z||000016||yogoat||06-19-2001||10:47 AM||||*puts his hand up, not knowing what he's doing*<br>This is boolsheet!!  I don't want Ecco to come out for the GBA, I NEED it to come out for the Gamecube!  The graphics would be way more better, the environments bigger...it'd be what you young'uns call "sweet"
Z||000017||GTK||06-19-2001||12:05 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Now that's what I call a point ^_^ Ecco on Gamecube! <p>That would be really great to see IMHO. I've got this scary friend who keeps sending me screenshots of Zelda 128 and it looks better than any DC games I've seen except possibly the SA intros. Ecco with a bit of Nintendo magic could well be the best game ever. 
Z||000018||yogoat||06-19-2001||12:29 PM||||I know, the Beta versions of Zelda looked better than Ecco.  The <i>beta</i> versions.  Those are  **** py, check out the screenshots at <a href="www.hyrule.com.ar">Hyrule.com</a> to see what I'm talking about-look at the screenshots from the gamecube.  If you scroll down, it shows how much Zelda64 has changed with the beta versions-and that's a really big change!  Just think of those pictures were twice as good as they were now.  Radical, huh?
Z||000019||Trace Kyshad||06-19-2001||12:56 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Hmm, it's most likely it'll be Ecco on Nintendo systems, which'll be cool to see that everyone's fave Dolphin has survived.<p>I'm still waiting for an alliance between Mario and Sonic, heck, that would be sweet... both universes just don't mix (One's the techno-present/future with Eco Warrior Sonic, and the other a mushroom filled kingdom with giant lizards) but hey! Anything to threaten the giant wallets of Sony...<p><IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
Z||000020||Trellius||06-19-2001||05:35 PM||thedolphin@ananzi.co.za|| <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> Actually, not many people know this, but when "Mario Bros" was first invented they were intended to be 'architechts' not plumbers. The mix up cam whith all the pipes and things in the game so people mistook them for plumbers!<IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well">
Z||000021||Trace Kyshad||06-19-2001||05:51 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Hmm, interesting<p>And Sonic the Hedgehog was originally planned to be a rabbit!<p>(From the mouth of Yuji himself if ya don't believe me)
