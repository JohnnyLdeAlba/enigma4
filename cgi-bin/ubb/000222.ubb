As some of you would know, not al dolphins follow the archetypical design that our friend ecco.  Some have no snout, while others have extremely lomg and pointy snouts.  ah i may as well give you all species names anyways since i have nothing else to do right now.<p>The River Dolphins<br>Superfamily Platanistoidea<br>Platanista gangetica- Ganges river dolphin<br>Platanista minor- Indus River dolphin<br>Lipotes vexillifer- Baji,or Yangza river dolp<br>Pontoporia blainvillei-Amazon river dolphin<br>                        or boto<p>The Marine Dolphins<br>Family Delphinidae<br>Steno bredanensis-rough toothed dolphin<br>Sousa chinensis- Indopacific hump-backed dolphin <br>Suusa teuszii-Atlantic hump-backed dolphin<br>Sotalia fluviatilis-Tucuxi<br>Lagenorhynchus albirostris-white-beaked dolphin<br>Lagenorhynchus acutus-Atlantic white-sided dolphin<br>Lagenorhynchus obscurus-Dusky dolphin<br>Lagenorhynchus obliquidens-Pacific white-sided dolphin<br>Lagenorhynchus cruciger-hourglass dolphin<br>Lagenorhynchus australis-Peale's Dolphin<br>Grampus griseus-Risso's Dolphin<br>Tursiops truncatus- bottlenose dolphin<br>Stenella frontalis-atlantic spotted dolphin<br>Stenella attenuata-pantropical spotted dolphin<br>Stenella longirostris-spinner dolphin<br>Stenella clymene- clymene dolphin<br>Stenella coeruleoalba- striped dolphin<br>Delphinus delphis- common dolphin<br>Delphinus capensis-William Dall's dolphin<br>Lagenodelphis hosei- Fraser's dolphin<br>Lissodelphis borealis-Northern right whale dolphin<br>Lissodelphis peronii-Southern right whale dolphin<br>Orcaella brevirostris-Irrawaddy dolphin<br>                      (Pesut)<br>Cephalorhynchus commersonii-commerson's dolphin<br>Cephalorhynchus eutropis- Black or chilean dolphin<br>Cephalorhynchus hectori- Hector's dolphin<br>Cephalorhynchus heavisidii- heaviside's dolphin<br>Peponocephala electra- Melon-headed whale, or electra dolphin<br>Feresa attenuata- pygmy killer whale<br>Pseudorca crassidens- false killer whale<br>Orcinus orca- orca or killer whale<br>Globicephala melas- long-finned pilot whale<br>Globicephala macrorhynchus- Short-finned pilot whale<p>well there you have it, the known living dolphins of today. I hope some of you find this informative.  I am crrently working on some more interesting facts on dolphins and their families to post here so keep a watch out.  Oh yeah i wish i knew how to put pictures in the forum like some of you can cuz you should the see the one picture i have of the long-finned pilot whale. With their round head and most smiley-looking face, they look so funny, or cute, as delphi would say.  well until next time...

In my state, Bahia (Brazil), they can be seen easyly in hot days swimming in not deep waters (sea) close to a estuary.<br>Inia geoffrensis is the amazon dolphin, boto or "boto cor-de-rosa" (pink boto). Unfortunately, I never seen one of these alive, only in pictures or movies. I would like to see one in its natural habitat, but I'm too coward and Amazonia is a very dangerous place: indians, farmers, "strange religious" people,miners, scientists, tree-killers, mosquitoes (with malaria Brrr), snakes, piranhas, sable-tooth tigers, dinossaurs and aliens <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">.

Z||000003||Felita||10-13-2000||08:53 AM||snowfox102@cs.com||Dragonboy mentioned orcas. It's near the bottom. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who knows orcas are dolphins <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
Z||000004||Bobaloo||10-13-2000||01:43 PM||j-bobaloo@juno.com||Speaking of marine life, yesterday at school I was reading all this info on the different kinds of sharks around the N. American Continent.  I guess that explains why I had a nightmare about sharks last night.<IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">

Z||000006||dragonboy||10-13-2000||06:39 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i am not much of a whale fan, although I do like them.
Z||000007||dragonboy||10-13-2000||06:45 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||oops forgot what I really wnted to respond to.  the Pontpoporia blainvvillei is known as either the Franciscan, or La Plata dolphin.  I jumbled something, the Inia geofrebsis is the amazon river dolphin, or boto.  i knew i'd screw up somewhere.  also the ganges and Indus river dolphins are known as Susu too.

Z||000010||Ecco The Dolphin||10-13-2000||09:09 PM||eccodolphin@hotmail.com||dragonboy, actually the Boto River Dolphin is different from Pontoporia blainvillei.  They were once thought to be part of that group but are actually different.
Z||000011||dragonboy||10-13-2000||09:29 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||hey, ecco.  look three posts up.  Dolphin classification has always been in dispute, expeciallyy whether river dolphins should be considered as closely related to their marine counterparts as they are now.  anyways my info comes from a notebook i have had for some time.  If anyone comes across new info, please tell me about it.  I will contimue to put more interesting facts about dolphins up as well when i organize mt reasearch a little better.  Well here's a little thing i learned abot dolphins- unlike humans, they have to consciously breath all the time even as they float placidly above the waves, unlike us who breath consciously and and unconsciuosly.  This affects otheraspects of a dolphins life, as i will detail in another post.
Z||000012||Coral||10-13-2000||09:41 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  I forgot to put Narwhal in my list. I found out about this in a book. The Beluga whale can smile and frown and do other kinds of facial expressions. The Beluga can also change the shape of its forehead. 
Z||000013||Histronic||10-14-2000||05:30 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Why do the river dolphins and those marine dolphins belong to different families?  I read that our marine friends evolved from the river dolphins.  River dolphins still have some of the features of the land animals they evolved from, like hair.

Z||000017||Eao||10-21-2000||10:23 AM||collprin@warwick.net||Zygoriza.........itsh a whale...with a wee neck.<p>I'm adding it to the species list for the bio page.<p>just in case somone has no "form" just a nick...but wants to be somthing.<p>what are Trella's kind called?  i called them Flying Dolphins.
