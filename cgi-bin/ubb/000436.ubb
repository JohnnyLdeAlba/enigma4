Z||000000||PsySonic||11-26-2000||06:08 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <p>... as we see: Blackfin has shown us all now, ONLY cares for megz but he cares us all again! I think this fight has opened our eyes and we see that it was pointless.<p>Blackfin surely has recognized now that the whole community here is as important as his relationship to Megz.<p>I've seen that Blackfin keeps always cool and never flames anybody! AND THAT IS! Blackfin is probably the most kind of this community!<p>For Crestoe: When I met you in first place, I saw you as a real nice person, please keep being so nice like in first place!<p>I hope this is the last Off Topic for this fight and everyone might now post his LAST message with how he feels and thinks about this now and put it to an end for himself and the community!<p>Please do post only ONE time and do not respond to anyones opionions! Tell only YOUR OWN thoughts, nothing more, that will hopefully end all this!<p>-PsySonic

I slept for 8 hours, woke up the next morning, and missed the biggest war on a Message Board ever (not this one, Sonic Fane Games HQ's). But needless to say, it's calmed down now (I think)<p>As for this fight, well, I wasn't part of it. If I fight breaks into a message board, people start to leave, when people start to leave two things can happen. One is that other people leave, or that people realise that the fight is pointless, and cease it. Glad to see that it's stopped now, but maybe cost.

You're just in love; it makes the best of us a bit wanky. ^_~<p>And back at the Squaresoft Fan HQ, we had <i> two </i> Forum Wars, and both made this thing look like a petty squabble. So it could've been worse.
