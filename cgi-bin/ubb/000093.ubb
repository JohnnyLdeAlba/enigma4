A couple other things, I believe some don't know what "dearth" means. It means starvation or famine(it makes sense now!). And I have only beaten 1 ecco game!(yet I'm here anyway)DOTF. I've never even PLAYED tides of time or Jr. If its not to much trouble, could someone please fill me in on the full plotline(I'd especially like to know when he got the stars on his melon)? That'd be great!

Ecco was born with the stars, the world ecco has in was being attacked by 'the vortex',  ecco was the choosen dolphin to save the world from the vortex, the stars on his head were in the shape of the constillation of the star system when the vortex lived, basically the stars marked the way to vortex...  <p>There is a new section for the site that will have the fully storylines for the orginal ecco games that will be going up in a month or so...

I think I posted them on the old forum, in a thread called Weird text or something like that, but I can send 'em to you if you want.
