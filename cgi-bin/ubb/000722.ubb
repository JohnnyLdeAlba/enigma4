Z||000007||PsySonic||03-21-2001||03:54 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/psysonic.jpg"> <br>No problem Trace!<p>DG, Yamaha SXG is a software you can sequence MIDIs with and it makes MIDIs sound nicer when you listen to them with it. I don't use it though, cause it's shareware and you can't use it after 21 days or so... I think you can get it at  <A HREF="http://www.yamaha.com/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.yamaha.com/</A>  <i>shrugs</i>
Z||000008||Trace Kyshad||03-21-2001||11:25 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||DG - Thanks very much for the compliments <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> And yeah, the Yamaha Synth can be a specific sound card for your computer, but it's also possible to get (I think) up to the XG100 version for Software, but as PsySonic said, it's shareware. I'm guessing you probably could find the *ahem* non shareware version somewhere...<p>Anyway, I started life in the Midi department with a really really poor midi composer from COmputer Music's weekly cover disk, back in those days... you needed to use the computer keyboard to compose anything (Which... wasn't really ideal). After a while, I came across http://www.massiva.com , it's freeware, and fairly easy to understand once you get into it. Along with XGedit95 (Which is basically a program used for adding the YXG effects, sounds and other niceities) that's been what I've used for the last 6 months or so...<p>With Massiva, instead of playing along with a connected musical keyboard (Which I think you probably could do), you simply work with "Tracks" (Or Instruments) and the notes, which you can simply click down on a certain note, increase the length, add an echo, and so on. As long as you have an idea what you want, you can probably do it. Otherwise, just do what I did with Unknown.mid and make it up as you go <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>And also, feel free to use these songs in anything <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Ok I haven't been doing piano for 19 years like DG (I'm not even 19 yet duh). Anyway it's 8 years for me. I've wrote some music too. So is there any way I can make MIDIs without having an electric piano (or whatever you call that piano you plug into the computer)?

Z||000031||Trace Kyshad||04-29-2001||06:34 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Lol, yeah, you can. In fact I do, I'd say a Keyboard would be better to use, but using a sequencer's more acurrate<p>Noteworthy Composer I think allows you to place down notes, kinda like making sheet music, while Cakewalk is apparantly one of the best sequencers to have. However, both of these will cost you cash<p>I use Massiva (Http://www.massiva.com) which is fairly simple to use. Provides an on screen keyboard layout so you can sample each note and instrument, and pretty much just point and click where you want the note. It's a little confusing at first, but if you work a little (And read the help file) it get's easier...
