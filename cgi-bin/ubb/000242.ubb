There's a few things you need to fix, such as the giant white spaces in the backgrounds *I am NOT nitpicking guys <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">* and the color of some of the text, but I can't wait to see it once it's finished. I'm part of the pod! *puffs out chest* Havn't been this proud since I made Moderator at the RPG-Vortex.....<Br> <Br> <Br> As for the chat session....erm.....I have....to go. Over here.<Br>

Z||000005||Eao||10-21-2000||10:13 AM||collprin@warwick.net||those hover buttons are a pain in ze flukes.....how do i make them work properly?<p>there are a java dealie
Z||000006||blackfin||10-21-2000||03:42 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||The roll over wants the java class file 'fphover.class' which should be placed in a subfolder called '_fpclass/' in the same folder as the html files, but Eao I don't think that I don't think I will actually use the rollover in the final page, what I really want is for you to design the form people fill in and how the page that peoples details are on.  I will handle how the pages are linked together.
