Right now I'm in school and yesterday my computer gave me after a wierd boot his last words... "System failure" and after that he didn't talk to me even if I tried to revive him (by clicking on the power button <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ) Heh, anyway, since my parents are in Africa right now and so I'm not able to buy a new computer I won't come here for the next time... I feel actually sorry, but somehow I also need to go away for some time from the computer and internet and all, maybe it's also better for me. But I will buy a new computer (which is also really needed, the p133 was really overworked) and of course I will be happy and come back and like Arkon would say "I will be faster and more powerful" <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> Nah, that's not what I think... I will only be happy to be around again. I might have a look into here in school again, but actually I don't think so. I don't really know for how long I will disappear, maybe 2 weeks or longer, depends on when I will get the computer and when I have all set up. So, I will see you around, guys. Don't do any bad things while I'm gone, I will still watch you <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> So, see you around <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> Stay Happy!!!

Z||000012||PsySonic||05-09-2001||03:26 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||Hey guys and gals! I'm back now finally! And I got a new computer! I have to set all of my good old programs and things up yet, but it is worth it! I hope I can save my old Hard Drive with all those files and especially scans and MIDIs, since nearly all of that stuff seems to be lost. Got to visit my friend sometime soon so he can work that out for me! Oh, and, btw, I finally got my driver's license! Last week on monday I had my test and it went really well! I only had to drive for 25 minutes, usually people have to drive 45 minutes or above, so I was lucky! Even the parking went fine, heheh! OK, enough of the babbeling around, I've missed all of you and I'm glad so many people missed me to! So, I will see yas around, be in chat! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
