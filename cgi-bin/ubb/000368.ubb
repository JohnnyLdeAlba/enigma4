I was actually gonna' switch from Charisma to Tigress, but then I got the bright idea to see if anyone could tell if I was the same person. I hope nobody is mad at me or anything. If you don't want to talk to me anymore I'll understand. Sorry.

I suspected you were tigress, ever since i remember you asking crest to make you a tiger face pic. And it seemed strange that Tigress and charisma both posted something at almost the same times, so either you both were at the computer at the same time, or you are the same person!  anyways i don't really mind.  enjoy your new persona.

I've about 60 posts, and I want to make it to pod member. I think maybe I'll post BOTH pic, because I can't choose just one.  <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcharisma.gif"> <br> <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/ftigress.gif">
