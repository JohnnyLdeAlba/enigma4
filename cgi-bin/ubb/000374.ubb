Z||000008||dragonboy||11-29-2000||07:44 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||by the way who was taking your picture, and why?  it looks like you live in the woods, according to that picture, am i right?  i wished  i lived in a more rural area.  i hate suburbia, it so....cramped with mean, really old neighbors who complain about everything.  to live out in the great outdoors......sigh
Z||000009||Coral||11-29-2000||07:58 PM||ntraver@epix.net||I also live in the "Great Outdoors".<br>Dragonboy, some old people are very nice and fun! I have an old neighbor (her name is Ginny and she's about 50) and she is very nice. She helps me alot with school projects,<br>cheering me up while I was upset about Chance, (I came home from school in tears because I couldn't hold them back any longer)<br>and just talking and feeding her killer catfish. Those catfish will bite at anything!<br>There are a bunch of wackos out here but it okay.

Z||000011||Delphi||11-29-2000||08:38 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||And I forgot to add, you aren't ugly in the slightest! See? None of us would say that. I mean, ME, I'm short and stubby, but hey...
Z||000012||Coral||11-29-2000||09:11 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Yeah, you're better looking than I am in my opinion. I have long wavy, dirty blonde hair, hazel eyes, and I'm thin. <br>
Z||000013||blackfin||11-29-2000||10:52 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||ok I offically designate this the Eao feelings support post. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

My advice is be like me and dont care and those who annoy the shit out of you flip them off and make fun of them!<p>Actualy dont follow that advice...All I'm saying is don't ever consider yourself ugly because when its all said and done your the only person who may accomplish more than any of these fruits and one day people will be coming to you and asking why was I so mean to you know your more powerful than I am what a loser I been and then you can laugh and spit on them!

Z||000017||dragonboy||11-30-2000||06:28 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||hmmmmm, that doesn't sound like other people don't mean much to you.  arkon is correct about not giving up on yourself so easily, but going through life treating others like competition, enemies, or enjoying vengeful acts is not going to help your state of mind as you get older.  you may very well end up alone,  successful, but noone to share that success with.
