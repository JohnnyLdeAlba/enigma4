By studying their communication, scientists believe that dolphins actually give names to eachother. Dolphins will make a particular sound to another and only one dolphin will respond as though he has been adressed. Also, dolphins keep one consistent name. This was found when a dolphin would make that particular sound to another and the same one would always respond. Howdaya' like them apples?
