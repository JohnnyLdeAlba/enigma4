Oh...heh...and you don't have to make 'em all from DoF...I've played the first Genesis one...I'm just better at the one's from DoF...hehe! But, I'm not the only one here...so do what you like... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"> <p>Your first one on the list Reptyx...is it Chirp and Smile? And, Sonic's are:<p>1. Trial Without Error<br>2. Labour Harness (btw...should that be spelled Labor?)<br>3. Pathways from Nowhere<p>Those were pretty good ones Sonic! Oh, and one more thing before I give my next one...the topic will last longer if you restrict yourself to just one word...it's a lot of fun! You make it into a race basically, to see who can figure it out first, then once they figure it out it's their turn to create a word! Just thought I'd mention that...though we don't have to play that way at all, if you'd rather not. Anyway...here's my word... <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> :<p>T I M E G N R A H

(you too Psy! ^_^ ) The move where you chirp and tailwalk is called Chirp and smile in the manual. (cute isn't it? ^_^ )<p>And since no-one figured out my first word (no, I'm sorry yogoat <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ), it is:<br>Annunziata<p>And my new one:<br>PEDANTNOOR
