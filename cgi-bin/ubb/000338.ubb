Anyone knows the answer?<br>

It's lair is well hidden, it's dark, and there are rays of color lancing down through the entrance. (not in the air though... but maybe they just needed something that rhymed?)

Its when you have to put the crystals into the hoop and then a rainbow comes down. That is when you have to jump into a hidden pool and then you go to the level Passages to Nowhere.
