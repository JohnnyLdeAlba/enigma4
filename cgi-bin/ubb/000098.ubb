Z||000000||dragonboy||09-14-2000||07:38 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||I was just reading a number of research and just plain entertaining dolphin articles in my school's database.  i thought i would cover one of them.  it seems that dolphin's sense of sight and hearing are linked in their brain, similarly like a human's taste and smell.  in one experiment a dolphins were tested using various objects suspended in the air and others hidden in an opaque plexiglass box underwater.  their retrieval rate was over 98%.  oppositely they had to scan the box then pick one of the suspended objects with just as much accuracy.  so they can scan as well as see.  Oh as you may know echolocation does not work in the air, since their frequency (in hertz) of clicks and such is disperse too quickly in air to  penetrate or richochet. any way it is assumed that the resolution of their echolocation can be as fine as to the cellular level, but little evidence has been found to support this (although bacterial colonies ((mostly harmless to living systems)) were introduced into the ocean to test this hypothesis. it did show dolphins avoiding that area of ocean for days.  later the government threatened to retract the researchers grant if they did something like this again).  well to another article:  the military, mostly navy, are researching the the physics of echolocation to devise new ways and technologies to detect  enemy vessels in the ocean, making everything virtually transparent compared to radar.  So far their attempts have been meager, since machines aren't sophisticated enough to reproduce the exact dispersion field and receptive apparatus that dolphins have "built-in".  new versions of night vision equipment are being designed with soundwaves as well, like the kind used on pregnant woment or people with internal organ problems (radiosound).  looks like nature is still ahead of technology is some ways.  well i thought some of you might find this interesting.  I have been researching studies into dolphin aggression (yes its true <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">  )in their relationships inside and outside their species.  it is quite graphic.  i guess all societies, animal and human, have their own dark sides. i may put a post on that, but maybe another time.
