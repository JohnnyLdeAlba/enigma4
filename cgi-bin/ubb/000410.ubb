SO much for the Sonic Foundation and SonicHQ's Music Sections, this site gives Vector a thing to listen too.<p>I'll have to check it out, the thing I'm pretty worried at is that Mids are TINY in file size, but on the site there's like a 3MB Zip... That's a whole load of mids!<p>And I've got a Yamaha Synth to enjoyt hem all on ^^ I love Midis, 'specially Sonic one's.
