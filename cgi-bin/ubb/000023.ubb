Trust me I was impressed cause playing on an 8-bit game gear then playing on genesis was like playing Ecco on Genesis and moving to DOF

I thought that when you actually put in the URL, there should be an option for "New to forums? Create an account now!" at the bottom of the screen or something... I can't remember since I registered like four months ago... sorry :o
