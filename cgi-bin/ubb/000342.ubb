Z||000000||dragonboy||11-01-2000||03:04 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i was just quickly logging in to a computer when i saw the familiar background to this site.  You know the dark blue coral reef and ship surounded by a black background. It was being used as wallpaper for a computer.  I wonder if another ecco fan goes to my college?  that would be cool to talk in real life to another ecco fan face to face.

Z||000003||blackfin||11-01-2000||09:57 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I am, I know people who have played the games, but I don't know anybody that is really into them.  The people I know all think of ecco as just another game.... So yes I would like me meet a 'real' fan in real life.  Or course I would like that fan to be female and interested but I think thats asking a bit much, so I'll just settle for finding a fan.
