What a umm....TERRIFYING enemy! <IMG SRC="smilie37.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh"> Looks more like an animatronic wooden fair-ground attraction. Is it MEANT to look like Trojan the 2nd?<br>Because to be perfectly honest, the sand at the sea-bed inspires more fear, and looks more realistic. How could earth be at threat from such  a blown-up wooden dinosaur.Shucks that is absolute sh*t. <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> are all the rest of the 'unbeatable', 'agressive' 'foe' like this?

(In fact, there had to be insperation there)<p>But anyway, I gotta get to the foe 'queen'... And I'm still having fun around the hanging waters (One more tower to go!)

I provided a link to Geiger's page and everything.....I honestly believe his drawings were the basis for the Vortex.
Z||000004||Trace Kyshad||10-30-2000||04:26 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Well, I saw the film/s Alien and Aliens before I played Ecco, and when I first saw the Vortex, I instantly recognised a hint of Geiger's work, even in the Background's in the Tube and the Machine...<p>But no I wasn't, I see where you see the connection, there is definetly something there...
