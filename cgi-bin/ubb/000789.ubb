Or did they change the music when they released Ecco for Sega CD?

I have the PC version of Ecco 1, and the few samples I can find of the Genesis music are different songs, and of course much lower quality.<p>(As a side note, try comparing the pre-rendered FMV sequences from the PC/Sega CD version with the in-game graphics from DOtF -- impressive!)
