The sad truth is nothing but two websites mine...lacking in Ecco content right now but holding the giant mystery of one of the most anticipated Ecco fanficts/game idea ever made based on many of the characters i figure most of you know by now..<p>Arkonviox...the immortal whos survied atlantises destruction and was based on the ultimate project to be the ultimate weapon...<p>Crestoe the thirian whos kind can live for hundreds of years (not immorttal) decendedant of what arkonviox is..old world atlantean!<p>Delta the only one who has figured atlantean technology and has the ability to repair old atlantean devices.<p>Clondike a young orca whos place in time is that of a link which will save the fure from the great dark whale apcalypes<p>and the seven dark whales the enimies of time who will help there master conqure the future by altering the past<p>But what about Eccos old enimie the vortex? Ecco will have to first come back from the void of time to stop a foe creature named verninues from awakening a drone vortex knwon as a "King"<p>But who is Atla? and Sitna?<p> <IMG SRC="http://arkonviox.com/object/unlimited.jpg"> <p>This is the greatest of battles in the story game project im doing the battle between good and evil at its finest Perfect Mutaclone (sitna) versus the great and legendary Atla<p>What is the story called? many of you oldbies would remember it as "Earth Clan"<br>done by crestoe<p>Its the story about The great mutaclone coming into power and conquring the world holding torniments in his great fortress called the "Megiddo Fortress"<p>But what about Arkonviox? where does he fit in? hes one of the many who trie to fight mutaclone his story bases him as an atlantean project based on the elements of wind water earth fire ice lighting<p>each character in my game has the ability to use one of these elements arkonviox is lighting crestoe is fire ecco is water and the ultimate element is strata<p>Arkonviox was made up of all elements but to make his power nutralized he was split into incarnations. meaning since he is an immortal he was torn into seprate beings each based on the seven elements<p>when all of these "Arkons" combine Arkonviox can acend into his second form i so named Arkonviox 2<p>But Atla versus mutaclone? who is atla and whats the story behind him? trust my its the biggest twist of my story that wont be known until i finish arkonviox.com which will be when i get enough Ecco information to become a true Ecco website<p>...to be continued....

We haven't had ecco2 yet.....   I don't think ecco is dead, well before the dreamcast game came out fans gathered here, even with no new games from Appaloosa I won't stop and neither will many other people, ecco won't die ever.
