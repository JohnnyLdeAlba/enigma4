A||||12||GTK||Newbie says hello!!
Z||000000||GTK||05-18-2001||12:50 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Hail, fellow Eccowarriors! <p>I'm the author of the AU Ecco fanfic "The Tidesinger Trilogy" which is currently steaming towards completion. To cut a long story short, blackfin brought me here when he discovered my fanfic ^^ Coupla RL facts about me: I'm 19 years old, and have been writing fanfiction since I was fifteen. In addition to Tidesinger, I've been responsible for the serialized Legend of Zelda fanfiction "Eloze", a Sonic Adventure epic called "Chaos Entity: The Opened Heart", various Pokémon things and a long series of work based on NiGHTS: Into Dreams (another very neglected Sega game). <p>You can find my Ecco work (incomplete, to Chapter 19) at http://members.spree.com/sip/farout34/ecco/index.htm and the first story is nearing completion. I'm currently looking for someone to do a couple of pictures to jazz it up: you can see the depth of my need if you check out http://www.saqnet.co.uk/users/nightopia/ which has some really bad drawings by me ^^; So there we go. <p>I'm very glad to have the chance to meet other Ecco fans. It's a shame that this is such a tiny category in the Internet world--no fanfiction to speak of, only two big fansites??? As far as the Undercaves goes: yes, I'm a total newbie so far, but hey--everyone was one once, so please be nice! I look forward to getting to know all of you, and I hope that I'll be able to become something of a regular here.

Z||000004||PsySonic||05-18-2001||05:19 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Welcome, GTK, I'm very curious about your fanfics, when I come home today I will start reading the Sonic Adventure one I think! I hope it's pure SegaSonic, I don't like the others (hmm... not speaking of Fleetway Sonic which is my other fave but, heh <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> ). And I'm really curious what the Ecco story will be like, how you wrote it and stuff. Well, I hope you will stay here and I have to say about your Ecco Website comment: In this case two big sites is one too much. But we can't change it, so we have to live with it ^_^;;
Z||000005||Trace Kyshad||05-18-2001||05:32 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||So, AoSTH, SatAM, Sonic Underground, Archie comics etc etc don't appeal to ya then?<p>There are waaaay to many seperate SonicVerses... it's getting silly. Still, not as silly as people who have massive arguments on which one's best... when it's obviously fleetway <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"><p>Anyway, Hello there GTK! That stand for anything? I'll hope to read yer fanfic at some point...
Z||000006||blackfin||05-18-2001||06:43 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Awesome to see you on the forum GTK, I can't wait for the rest of your awesome fan fic.
Z||000007||Debaser13||05-18-2001||08:36 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||As a fellow fanfic writer myself, I have to say you're doing an AMAZING job on the Tidesinger Trilogy. It's as well-written as anything published, and.....well....I for one am hooked. ^_~<p>Ever played any RPGs? Any of the Final Fantasy games? I would KILL to see you writing on some of those....Hoo boy.<p>I've written several fanfics based on the Final Fantasy games myself, and tried to start a few Ecco fics. They're up on this site, as a matter of fact, but I plead you not to judge my skills based on them. I've improved a bit since then, you see. ^_^<p>Gotta....stop...rambling...

Your Nuitari was the best Nights-fan character I've ever seen! <br>About Tidesinger trilogy - wow - that is amazing. I still haven't read it completely but I'm sure that "much more adventures" are yet to come <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <p>It's good to have you here, but since I am a "minor" board member you won't see me much around <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> <p>BTW, have you noticed the similarity betwen Ecco DotF and Nights? <br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>Yes! the stolen "gifts"!

Z||000010||blackfin||05-19-2001||12:24 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||That is a VERY good point Riveler, that is very similar to nights how the 'gifts' are stolen, fasinating.
Z||000011||GTK||05-19-2001||01:44 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Riveler, if you're really into NiGHTS, check out another of my websites: <br>http://members.spree.com/sip/farout34/nights/index.htm <br>This is Sleepless NiGHTS, the single most complete archive of NiGHTS fanfiction. You can even find MY old work which is mostly really [insert expletive here] because I wrote it when I was 15... <br>Anyway, it's the only place you'll find such a big collection of NiGHTS fanfic now that Nightopia is frozen and Arcana's down. I set it up to preserve the Internet's NiGHTS heritage. <p>But regarding the gifts, that's an interesting point! On a similar note, has anyone else had NiGHTS flashbacks when playing Hanging Waters?? I don't know what it is, the music or something, but I was getting really weird while I was jumping around in those [insert expletive here] bubbles... 
Z||000012||Riveler||05-19-2001||01:08 PM||riveler@uol.com.br||Now i've got a lot of Nights fics to read <IMG SRC="smilie9.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="glowing"> <p>I've never had a "Nights Trip" when playing Hanging Water level but I can understand: remember the first Elliot level (Splash Garden)? It looks a lot HW level in Ecco because all those bubbles.
