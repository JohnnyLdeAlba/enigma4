It seems like <i>every stinkin time</i> Arkonviox, Crestoe, or Xoivnokra says <i>anything</i>, literally, it's <i>always</i> construed as them trying to pick a fight! Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending them over everything because I know at times that's exactly what they're trying to do, but there is also times when what they're saying is nothing of the sort, and in <i>no</i> way, them trying to pick a fight! Seems to me like some of you <i>like</i> this "fighting" business! Anymore, when a little thing is said by these guys, everyone goes ape-wild! Like I said before...sometimes they are starting stuff, but I think there are times when they may say something little and people are incredibly too sensitive about it. I think those of you who want the fighting to stop, should quit asuming that no matter what comes from them, they're picking a fight. And, if they are fightnig with someone, or anyone's fighting for that matter, I think people should learn how to stay out of other peoples' business. Don't get in the middle of people bickering, at least not in the begining...you're doing no good! If you see the fight going on and on, then maybe you could try to calm them both down...but don't do it by telling one to shut the hell up either! That'd get your ass kicked in real life! Let them duke it all out...and stay clear of it. That's what I try to do, and I'm less stressed about the whole ordeal. Why involve myself in something that doesn't really concern me...? I have a suggestion about how to deal with Arkonviox, Crestoe, and Xoivnokra though...when at all possible, don't take what they say so seriously. Some of you guys should really learn to laugh off some of what they say...and ignore them if they bother you. You just might find yourself not getting so uptight. Anyway, those are just my thoughts, and I hope to not gain any enemies over posting my opinion.
