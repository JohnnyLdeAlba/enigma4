Z||000000||PsySonic||11-23-2000||02:09 PM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <br>Hey all...<br>Well, as I see, animated face pics get more and more on this forum and I asked myself, is this really good at all? I like the art and like to look at them but when I only want to read through messages on the forum it sometimes diverts me from reading.<p>I read, like most of us do, from top to bottom. But when I sroll through the messages and suddenly see a blinking face pic i really have to look at it everytime it blinks again (I think it was Coral's)...<p>Well, if you all like these animated things that much and don't feel like me, then let this be as it is - I won't care and probably get used to it. But at the mo it's a bit confusing...<p>-Psy

(Scary visions of me driving... on a road... in real life... not seem to come to me)<p>As for the face pics, well, Once I've seen them once, I've seen them before, so they don't distract me too much. I think the problem is they're right next to the text people type. As Blackfin said, in due time this will be fixed.

You don't even go out on the road, or at least at the place I got my licence didn't make us.  The thought of how many others got theirs this easily makes me want to scream!  *curls into the fetal position and makes incoherant whimpers*<IMG SRC="smilie21.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH=17 BORDER=0 ALT="errr"><IMG SRC="smilie21.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH=17 BORDER=0 ALT="errr">

Just drive to a Florida mall, you'll see!!!  <br>Old Lady 1 "Which way is the arrow pointing?<br>Old Lady 2 "I Don't know, I can't see over the dash."<br>Old Lady 1 "Well, If we just follow this nice young man in, we'll find out where to go!"<br>*LOUD CRASH!!!*<br>Old Lady 2 "Look!  The store is over there!  I never Knew there was a parking lot in the mall."<br>*Both leave for Betty's House Of Humerous Knitted Objects, leaving carnage and deceased survey-ladies in their wake*
