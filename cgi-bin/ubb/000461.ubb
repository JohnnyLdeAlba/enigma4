I wanted ask something though is it possible you could do a track out of DOF? Like for example mutaclones music? I absolutly been wanting that for a long time but know there isnt anybody who could possibly do one! So I thought I just ask you for one since you got a great talent!<p>Also that ecco jr midi you did could I use it for my website?
Z||000001||Trace Kyshad||12-03-2000||10:28 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Sure, you can use the Mid for yer site,<p>As for the DoF Music, I mentioned in the other post, and I also had a look around some sites. As soon as Black gets mp3s up, then I should be able to make a few mids (Hangin waters, Boss encounter, Epilogue are 3 I have in my mind right now,)<p>But yeah, Once the tunes are accessable, I'll be able to make somthin' (Hopefully)

Z||000004||Delphi||12-03-2000||04:55 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||I know what that song is!!!! It's that supposed "Hidden Palace" level's music (that was taken out of Sonic 2's level roster, right? Or so everyone says it is, anyway...).<p>If you redid it, it's excellent!
Z||000005||Delphi||12-03-2000||04:55 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Oh, yes, your site says you made it. EXCELLENT!
Z||000006||Trace Kyshad||12-03-2000||05:19 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Yeah, the music on my site is the Hidden Palace level (Dropped) from Sonic 2 (Accessed by Sonic 2 Beta ROM). I've always loved the tune, and always wanted to make a Remix.<p> I did, in the form of a Techno Remix. After a while, I figured I wanted a more slower peaceful type for my site, and remixed the remix to a slow piano piece. And so 'twas born. ^^<p>Delphi, sure you can use the Ecco Jnr one, but not Lucidity. That's one I made for a game, so it's technically (c) Rob Showalter. The game itself is a Fangame called Sonic Epoch (Still in production, a Sonic Fangame, one of the most popular created, and I compose around 50% of the game's massive soundtrack)<p>Everything on my site, and also at http://www.segasonic.net/sage/hdp/ (Now disused) is all free.
Z||000007||Delphi||12-03-2000||06:46 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Hmmm. Okay then, <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> that's too bad... it's a really good job, though, and I'll use the Ecco one for sure... and now I have to go listen to your other stuff!<p>Thanks!
