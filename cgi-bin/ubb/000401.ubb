This, suprisingly, is a FF8 fic dealing with one of the soldiers who goes to Winhill to kidnap *spoiler*. Tell me what you think so far; but I really like the way it's going. It's going to be a seriocomedy, methinks.<Br> <Br> Oh yeah, I have to plug the new site I'm working for : www.animealert.org We write goofy articles about anime. Love us. I'm Negative Creep there, so look for my article on the new anime Peter Rabbit.<Br> <Br><p>The suit itched. And his mask was hot. And if his comerade started talking about his family back home one more time, <br>Kerrison swore to himself, he would personally shoot the annoying bastard.<p>The life of a Esthar soldier was not easy, especially not when every mission they took as of late led them straight into the <br>boondocks. When Kerrison had signed up to be a soldier, a fresh-faced boy of twenty, his immediate thoughts had been of <br>all the new places he'd see. Being stuck in Esthar, as appealing as it seemed to some, was not his idea of a life, and the youth<br>had looked foreward to seeing the wide world outside the boundaries of the advanced metropolis he had been raised in. <p>But so far all he'd seen was the inside of his mask and a whole lot of backcountry. <p>"So, Lance, you know where we're being assigned yet?" he'd asked one of his higher ranking friends eagerly a few weeks <br>before. "Dollet? Galbaldia?" <p>The older soldier turned to him with a half-amused/ half-disgusted expression.<p>"Nope. Winhill."<p>A look of confusion passed over Kerrison's face. "Huh?"<p>Lance grinned at him. "Some backwater village in the middle of nowhere. The order came directly from the witch; I sure as hell <br>ain't arguing with her."<p>Kerrison had shuddered at the thought of Adel. He'd only seen the Sorceress once, but it had been enough. He had to wonder<br>at the term "sorceress" though; he had his doubts she was a woman. Hell, he didn't know if she was HUMAN. "I guess we're<br>stuck then" he sighed, trying to keep cheerful. No village could be THAT remote; for the boy raised in the heart of Esthar his <br>entire life no buildings towering around him was an impossible thing to imagine.<p>But here he was, in the middle of nowhere, trudging through what had to be the most godforsaken place on earth, at least to <br>him. And there wasn't a skyscraper or car in sight. And it was driving him NUTS. The only thing you could hear was the sound <br>of your own feet crunching through the grass and gravel of the plains, the occasional seabird, and crickets. So many damn<br>crickets. <p>"I wonder if you can shoot crickets" he thought morosely, kicking at a stick in the path.<p>*Isn't this great?" bubbled the soldier directly behind him in line "I'll bet you could walk miles and miles and never hit an outpost!<br>And listen to that silence. You'd never hear it this quiet in Esthar, that's for sure!" The soldier took a deep breath and Kerrison<br>just <i> knew </i> he must be beaming beneath his mask. Stupid bastard. Anyone that happy after a 27 mile hike through the <br>outback was either not too bright or had a serious mental deficency. Or both. Kerrison gritted his teeth and kept on walking,<br>resisting the urge to scream bloody murder at his hapless comrade.<p>It didn't help that they'd been on an airship for the past 5 hours <i> before </i> landing on this continent and setting out to hike <br>the 35 miles to Winhill. The excuse for just not flying there was the Esthar forces wanted an element of suprise, and hovering <br>the largest ship in the fleet over the tiny town would have told even the dimmest residents that something was amiss. But <br>Kerrison could care less about suprise; he had been sick on the way over, and the last thing he felt like doing was hiking. <p>The line of soldiers passed a chocobo carcass; victim of old age or some predator that had eaten its fill and moved on. From <br>the looks of things it couldn't have been that long ago, but the smell........the heat had done its magic.<p>Kerrison felt himself gag at the stench, and desperately tried to hold his breath. It didn't work; the smell crept into his nose<br>like it had a purpose. He couldn't hold out. Ripping his mask off, he turned to retch..........<p>...........All over Mr.Happy behind him. <p>"Let's see you say something nice about <i> that </i>" Kerrison thought sardonically.<br>
