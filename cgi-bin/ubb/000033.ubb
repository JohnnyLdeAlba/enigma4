A||||1||dragonboy||a problem with online gaming?
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-03-2000||07:35 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i recently read an article in Game Informer that brought out a potential problem concerning online gaming between dreamcast users and pc users. as i am not very literate, i was hoping blackfin or someone else could help clarify this somewhat. here is the article:  "What if i'm playing with someone using broadband? Simple-you won't. For games that allow pc users to play with dreamcast owners [Quake III Arena,for example], broadband users will be identified and unable to join groups using their 56K modems. This shouldn't be too big a problem initially, but if a broadband upgrade becomes a reality for dreamcast, a schism between the haves and the have-nots could suddenly appear." i am looking forward to playing phantasy star online and also the supposed online gaming plans set for the next ecco game.  how is this going to affect us, the gameplayers?<br>

If the games are split so only slow people are in one game and fast in the other, either there will be enough to fill both games or everbody will just get what they need to join the most popular of the games and everybody will just play with a fast or slow connection (depending on what speed most people end up having) and everybody will be in the same game.  Broadband is coming down in cost, by the time real online gameing is here most people who can affort a pc or a dreamcast should be able to afford it.
