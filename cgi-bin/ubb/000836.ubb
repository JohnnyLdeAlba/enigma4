Here is the thought provoking question: <IMG SRC="confused.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="confused"> <p>There are many enemies in the Ecco games, but are they evil? The vortex creatures came to earth because they needed to survive. Is that evil? Maybe...maybe not. <p>This little tidbit may have been asked before, but I thought it was interesting.<p>What do you think? Anyone?        <IMG SRC="smilie46.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="idea"> 
Z||000001||Alastor||06-04-2001||05:33 PM||snaredrum181@aol.com||Oh yeah. Forgot to put what I think.<p>Well, I believe that the enemies in the Genesis Ecco games are not that evil, but I'd say their methods are a bit screwed. <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="roll eyes"> <p>...just a little.<p>As for the Dreamcast game, I'm poor so I simply cannot aford a Dreamcast, so as a result of this, I have never played the game on Dreamcast.*sigh* <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> <p>Well thats about it. Oh, and I'm not sure what like, the face pic's URL can be. Someone please explain to me what that is.<br>Yeah, I know, it's probaly really obvious.<br>But hey, this is me we are talking about. <IMG SRC="smilie16.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="demented">

I thought I was the only one to think this way but now I see I'm not alone <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <p>I do not remember completely the plot in the first 2 Ecco games, but was the vortex kind REALLY in danger of life when they came to earth?
Z||000003||Whitefin Dolphinius||06-05-2001||02:25 AM||loutus_leopard@hotmail.com||Well when you really think about it.....<p><br>The Vortex kind where really only looking for a place they could really call home, a place to thrive, survive.<p>In the first Ecco, you find the Mysterious Glyphs in Atlantis, they tell the story of how the Vortex destroyed the city. My theory is that, they only hurt the Atlantians because the Atlantians where trying to 'get rid of' the Vortex.<p>Nyahh, I love my Ecco games <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"><p><br>Whitefin
Z||000004||blackfin||06-05-2001||07:27 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||The Vortex were feeding more and more in earth so eventually they would have eaten all life on Earth and the glyphs in the Library tell you that 'Vortex can no long support life' (the planet not the species) so the vortex didn't have any other choice but to feed on Earth BUT only because they had already wiped out all life on their plannet so I vote evil.<p>Now as for the face pic url Alastor, that is for the address of a picture that you have to represent your character's face, (look to the left of this text for mine a dolphin with a black fin).<p>Oh and :thumbsup: great idea for a discussion ^_^ just the sort of thing we need to keep things interesting here ^_^
