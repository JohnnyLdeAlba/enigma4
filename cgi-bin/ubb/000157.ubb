The worst part is its not mine and I have to give it back tommorow!!!!!!<IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> Can any of you tell me how you past the level. I'm on the part when you have to raise the water level and complete some sequence with colored buttens. HELP!!!

Their coming to take the Dreamcast pretty early in the morning. I'll probably try and beat it quickly right now using those walkthroughs. Thanks again.
