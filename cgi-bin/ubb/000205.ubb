Two question concerning this:  when, and is it possible.  what i mean from the latter is if it is legally possible for you to do so, i mean with all that nonsense napster is being thrown at by the music industry.  would appaloosa/Sega do anything against you if you did choose to do this.  I hate how this world is turning out in some ways.  music is about expression and feeling, it should be spread freely, to whoever wishes to hear it rather tha being forced to pay or become subject to some kind of punishment.  Freedom seems to be an ideal that is dying away little by little.

I don't think I will have any trouble over it, I have permission of one of the composers of ecco2 (mega drive) music to use mp3's of his music on my site for a start and I doubt sega or Appalloosa will care that much.  Besides I am heading towards getting my own personal webserver some time, and when that happens nothing short of a court order will be able to stop me.
