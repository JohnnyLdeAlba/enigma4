I just want to know if you are working on that alien design for me. You said that you would. Man, I posted 2 topics about the same thing and you didn't give me a message!! Is it because I called you Bloodfin instead of Crestoe?! I'm sorry I'm just impatient I can't wait to see the aliens that you're making.

Dont worry, I'll cime up with the pictures fast, probably a bunch by tommorow. Coming up with aliens is hard, thinking of a look could make your head explode! <IMG SRC="smilie35.gif" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100 BORDER=0 ALT="dead">
Z||000003||Coral||10-16-2000||08:14 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Thanks Crestoe!! I just got excited that's all.

But the look for the new aliens...well, give me a description on how you would imagine it!<p>BTW, Crestoe is NOT a villian! I thought i'd say that well i was on the subject. I'll tell you his story when i finished it. ME and Arkon are deveoping a charicter biography section with all the charicters, and maybe that will soon awnser some of PPLs questions.
Z||000005||Coral||10-17-2000||07:38 AM||ntraver@epix.net||I'll try to. Um.....I have no clue.
Z||000006||Coral||10-17-2000||07:46 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Um..........I swear my brain is falling out of my ears!!! Ummmmmm.....how about the king or queen is....I don't know!!! I'll have to think about it while I'm at school.
Z||000007||Coral||10-17-2000||05:10 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  How about 1 that is snake-like and can blend in with any of its surroundings. It'll have lots of sharp teeth and have just 2<br>front claws. Another 1 that can fly, but it looks like a bird with sharp teeth and has razor-like wings, an eel like tail, and mean looking eyes.<br>1 that can have velociraptor shape, but have a razor sharp tail. This one will be able to walk on land and attack when Ecco is a leopard.<br>The king has the ability to control the water and make tidal waves and stuff. He will look like a fast, sleek water dragon. He will have <br>big teeth, snake-like body and has a huge tail fin. <br>The queen on the other hand is much larger than the king and can control the wind.<br>Will look like another dragon, but larger than the king. She will have 2 horns, big teeth, a whip like tail that shock Ecco, and make her more muscular than the king.<br>Whatcha think? I just came up with it finally.
