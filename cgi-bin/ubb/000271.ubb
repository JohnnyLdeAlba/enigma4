A||||12||dragonboy||an example of yogoat's uncoolness
Z||000000||dragonboy||10-23-2000||11:02 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||it seems mr goat has no honor among his fellow podmates.  I accidentally received op status on the chat and I was just going about my business like nothing was different.  Crispy came on, leashy, eccochick, and yogoat.  Seeing how i was an op, yogoat displayed severe impatience and agitation.  I  asked him that if i gave him op status, that i could remain an op as well.  He agreed and I made him an op.  As soon as i raised him, he threatened to take me off.  I and our fellow chatmates witnessed the power-driven ego of this op as he was so uncooly trying to strip me away from this so highly exalted (sarcasm) position.  He finally agreed.  about 15 minutes later, i could not read anyone on the chat.  this lasted for about 7 minutes or so. The very first thing i saw was yogoat's command to take away the op status i had.  But i still was an op. weird.  For 10 minutes he kept obsessing about me still being an op, like i was some sort of hostile nation trying to steal his territory.  On my screen it showed that yogoat wasn't an op.  so out of fairness to our original agreement i reinstated his op status.  Well the first thing he did was to take away my status and dishonor our agreement.  All i can say is, "What the hell?"  Am I that untrustworthy, that disliked that I couldn't be a temporaruy op. Sheesh, i'm dissapointed enough that i wasn't even offered an op status for all my participation in this site, not too mention the chatroom.  I wasn't going to mention this, but if it wasn't for barbarian and I first using this chatroom on a regular basis, this wonderful way to communicate among ecco fans would probably never have started.  Well that's all i have to say except this:  Goat, I know being the chat op is probably the greatest thing in your life right now, but why did you have to be such a jerk about it when someone else wanted to experience it for awhile.  You also have a lot of growing up to do, not only as yogoat, but also as Simon.

You attempted to take athority on the channel which you have no right to, by trying to lord over yogoat and trying to make him do your bidding by trying to force him to aggree to let you stay as an op something you should have never hadin the first place.  I wasn't there so I don't know exactlly what happened but I don't like what I hear from either side.  But Dragonboy understand one thing, I don't hand out op status as favours, I choose yogoat because he seemed to be the person best fitted to the task.  Just because you have spent a lot of time at this website doesn't mean you should get anything, and after this childish outburst over something as unimportant as being an op (I think that if you want somebody who thinks being an op is the greatest thing in the world you should try looking in the mirror Dragonboy), you can forget any chance of me considering you as an op in the near future.

I'd like to take a closer look at this conversation, from what I hear from Dragonboy, yogoats conduct in the incident may not have been that good either, If anybody present was keeping a log file of the conversating can you please send me a complete copy of it.

Qualified? *Suppresses laughter* <Br> <Br> I think you did just fine, Dragonboy. Yogoat's about as qualified for moding a chat as....well.......a goat. From what I'd seen I'd much rather have Dragonboy running the show than Yogoat. <Br> <Br> And get off his back, 'Fin. Sheesh. That's all I'll comment about this.

In my opinion, Dragonboy was right with his acts on that situation. <p>By the way, getting op by accident sounds very, very rare for me.
Z||000006||dragonboy||10-24-2000||03:00 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||I wasn't looking to ever become an op, nor display jealousy over goat's status.  Nor do I think I deserve anything from my participation in this site, all i would ever want is a little understanding and just a little trust from him and everyone else.  But I am more concerned over the attitude from goat, I don't mind him being an op at all, i just wanted to have the @ symbol for a little while, no big deal, and I was going to raise him to op anyways.  I just wanted to stay op for awhile until black arrived.  Anyways, now that you brought it up, what are yogoat's qualifications for being chosen as your op, other than the fact that he's on for about 6 hours a day (not that he's physically at his computer most of that time, right eccochick!)  I publicly apologize for causing a small disturbance to this site, but i will not admit that what i did was out of the ordinary and morally wrong.  After all, I, goat, nor anybody else is perfect.

People take advantage of these types of things and I'll admit I hate my fun when I took over the chat myself and banned that dam goat! But to face a lil realitie NO ONE should have op privaligdes at all!!! leave it to the conductor not to some under qualified 12 year old. If some one wants to become an op though email it to [url]mailto:Who_gives_a_crap_what_you_want@arkonviox.com[url] and I'll be glad to tell you to shut up!

I don't really know what op means. BTW, consider yourself lucky that I'm actually taking a side in this debate, as I'm normally militantly neutral in this kind of thing.

Where #1 otha fuckaz!<p>I am on Dragon side as well, Yogoats a punk ass...<p>No, i had better step back...<p>I am the Nuke man, i'll tell Yogoat when i have had enough, but I am also on blackfins side, so i will stay the hell away from the chat.<p>I dont like him that much, for one: He is stupid, so stupid that i could easily replace him and you wouldnt see white trash over a stupid name.<p>But...look at Ecco chick?

Z||000012||Histronic||10-27-2000||09:15 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||I don't know about this.  I usually try to avoid flames of any sort, but I think I should take the majority's side.  More people are against Yogoat, and ther are three or more posts about how bad he is.  Nothing personal Blackfin, but it doesn't matter who deserved the athority, but dragonboy and yogoat had an agreement.
