Z||000000||Arkonviox||09-30-2000||02:00 AM||www.arkonviox@prodigy.net||From what I hear defender of the future two revolves around the mutaclone, right now its a rumor but david brin has mentioned in a game article (gamepro) that the mutaclone was not de3feated ecco mearly defeated a clone and the mutaclone itself followed ecco back to his present. If thats not wierd enough didnt I mention I had an idea about that somewhere? Yeah so ecco didnt defeat it but mearly a clone and the games in the works now be david brin.

"It makes me wonder what kind of world you come from and what would happen if you were to touch the treasure i protect. But I cannot risk all that I know for the sake of curiosity. So sadly, your brave quest ends here. Goodbye Ecco."<p>I liked playing Dolphin's nightmare and fighting the Clan so that's good news for me.

Z||000006||SnowFox102||10-01-2000||10:47 AM||snowfox102@cs.com||Mutaclone is the name of the level in which you fight the most Exalted One of the Clan. He is able to clone himself, so once you are able to attack him, you have three of him to deal with! Only one is the real one, though. Or so we thought...
Z||000007||Arkonviox||10-01-2000||04:23 PM||www.arkonviox@prodigy.net||As david brin said in the article mutaclone is his name. I hope to get ahold of that issue to show everyone
