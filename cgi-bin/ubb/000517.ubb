My Ecco 1 ROM is in smd format so it's interleaved, but you can make out the text with some imagination.<p>Heheheh... I hacked a Phantasy Star IV savestate to raise everyone in the party to level 99 so I could beat the last bosses in a breeze... <p>

Visit www.zophar.net and look into the utilities section <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Z||000017||blackfin||12-24-2000||01:43 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Kewl Reptyx, I need modivation to get myself to do stuff like that, my problem with programming is that I need more practice to make anything big and the only things I want to program are big... I really should try more stuff like that...
