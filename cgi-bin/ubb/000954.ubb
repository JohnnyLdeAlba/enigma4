Leap over the wall and enter the area where you can speak to the shark song and turtle song dolphins. Swim onward with an eye on the bottom. There is a large round stone that sticks up; it's at the bottom of a dip, with another stone near it. This is the landmark. <p>Now keep an eye on the left hand side of the level, and swim on. The place is absolutely riddled with holes here (whoever was supposed to be closing the gap between the sand and rock textures must've had an off day!). Probably the easiest for the inexperienced at reality-surfing is a smallish round hole; Ecco fits through it easily. Look on the ground near the left wall for a group of three of those circular sponge-like things in blue and purple--you can see them from the rock. Swim to them. You'll see a flat gray stony thing stuck against the wall of the level. On the left hand side of this is the hole. Point yourself downwards to swim through... it's a bit hard to see, as you have to slip UNDER the sand texture from the rockside, but once you've done it once you'll not have trouble. <p>Fascinatingly, this hole seems to appear and disappear according to whether you've been through it or not. If it vanishes, swim away to somewhere like one of the tunnels or the entrance pool then swim back and find the hole again--it reappears when the game redraws that part of the level. A word of warning: there are lots of even bigger holes in the alcove a little further on where the six orange spongy things are, but be careful because that area does weird things and Ecco likes to freeze while he's swimming through it. This level is glitchy at best when you start messing around with it. <p>Once out of the hole, you need to disentangle yourself from the underside of the level before you can get air. This can be more difficult than you imagine, for the simple reason that some VERY strange effects can be observed outside POTCR. For instance, I was swimming (or trying to swim) along the perimeter of Ol' Whitey's lagoon, when suddenly BAM! I was back in the home bay with the racing dolphins. I think this might be something to do with the way the different parts of the level are all superimposed on one another. You'll have to try it yourself to get what I'm talking about. One thing's for sure--this is one of the most interesting glitches to explore so far.

Anyway, I'll have to check this out when I find time to play the game again...sounds pretty cool... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">
