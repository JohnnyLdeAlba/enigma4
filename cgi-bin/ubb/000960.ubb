Z||000002||yogoat||07-04-2001||01:48 AM||||Hmm, I'd have to go with the Negative Image Dolphin...I think that's way past sweet  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> 
Z||000003||dolphingirl||07-04-2001||03:09 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Wow...those are all really cool Alastor! I tend to have the same taste of Arkon though, I'd say "An evilish dolphin <IMG SRC="devil.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="evil"> " is the best choice. However I also for some reason, really like the "Bunch of red dolphins <IMG SRC="smilie34.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="kane"> " one...and yeah...the "Negative Image <IMG SRC="smilie9.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="glowing"> " one would be a third choice. So yeah...there's my imput... <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
