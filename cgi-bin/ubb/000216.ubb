Z||000010||That guy with the hat||10-12-2000||06:53 PM||||Yeah well my first chao's name was Quincy. He was such a good chao. Too bad I lost him when I accidentally deleted my A-life file. Currently my 5 favorite chao are Cliff(as in Cliff Clavin from Cheers): A regular Sonic Chao with all appandages and ears and things normal.<br>Norm(As in Norm Peterson, also from Cheers): A fat Chao(Yellow+Red) with a big grin and all appendages and things normal.<br>Carwash(don't ask): An obsidian Hyper Chao(Green+Purple)with all appendages and things normal and a lot of 'tude. He's always gotta' smack the fools.<br>Tobasco(I thought it sounded nice): A black Fish Headed Air Chao(Purple+Yellow) with a big grin and all appendages and things normal. Thing is she never learned to swim for some reason. And finally...<br>THE INCREDIBLE TRANSFORMING MR.X(Just Mr.X for short): I always turn him into something different when he regenerates.<p>At any rate welcome Charisma!
