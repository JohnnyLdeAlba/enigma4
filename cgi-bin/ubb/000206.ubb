I finally beat Hanging Waters now I am too Chance of Reckoning witch once I play I will beat I just wanted to watch the Simpsons so I shut it off it's not hard so I didn't worry.

Some nice fic fodder there, and it was cool seeing a red-eyed dolphin. The only thing I didn't like was not knowing which direction that damn eel was ; it was nerve racking.<Br> <Br> Oh, and the manta rays were cool too. I couldn't help humming "Manta Ray" by the Pixies the entire time, though....<br> <Br> "My Manta Ray is al-right.....My Manta Ray is al-right...." <Br> </i>
