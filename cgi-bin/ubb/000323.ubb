It pisses me off, and what the hell does that glyph mean "This way is very hard, but not insoluble"? Is the fact you start drowning right away linked to the message the glyph gives you? Maybe it's forcing you to see you must become a jellyfish?<p>*gee, I'm thinking too much into this*<p>Ideas, anyone?

If a substance is Soluble (EG Salt) it can be dissolved to form a solution (EG. Salt Water)<p>(I'm sorry, Standard Grade Chemisty Does This To You)<p>So basically, to put this into English - This way is very hard, but it can be dissolved - Sounds like simply an interesting way of saying 'It's hard, but not impossible'
