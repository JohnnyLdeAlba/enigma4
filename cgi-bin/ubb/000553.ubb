I've heard that it's going to come out somewhere in the year 2001. I CANNOT WAIT!!! *clicks play to see the demo again* I love the way Ganon and Link fight! It's so cool! I heard that you can play as Zelda in that game and 2 people can play at the same time!<br>Did any of you hear any other rumors?<br>

I've heard of the Microsoft X Box, but no GameCube... *sigh* another 'happening' as you may call it system coming out? I think the Dreamcast will definitely be going under where I live very soon...
