Crestoe is awsome at it...as well as Reptyx (the artist of my current one). Eao has done some cool ones, ...vantid (if she's still around), and others! Just ask around and I'm sure you could find someone who'd be happy to make one for you! I would if I could...but I can't...hehe!<p>Oh oh! Almost forgot about yogoat! You could ask him too... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">

Z||000004||dolphingirl||06-12-2001||03:45 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Yeah...that would be nice. I guess you can just add that to your looooong list of "things to do"... <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> 
Z||000005||blackfin||06-12-2001||08:11 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||hehe well I'll get thought it, I should actually have some spare time in 3 weeks and perhaps then I can get everything finally finished, I'm going to have a good go at it at any rate.. ^_^
