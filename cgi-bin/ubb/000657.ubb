Saying Sonic adventure 2 could end on on gameboy and N64 (never thought id see the day..)<p>Sounds true: Sega will release 100 games through out the year 2001. SO good news forme, there will be a XFL and NFL 2k2! ^_^ (Joy!)<p>Other rumours include sega and nintendo alliances but sound like bull shiut right now.<p>and on another note, dreamcast.ign.coms chat with appoloosa says that there will be a ecco defender of the future sequel (This was said before sega announced there retiring)<p>Now the question is, could these rumours be true and if so, what will happen to the ecco the dolphin dreamcast sequel?<p>And when will beer prices be cheaper!?

I've actually emailed somebody at appaloosa about this just now so hopefully I may get some answers.
