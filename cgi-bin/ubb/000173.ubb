That poster I gave away was given to me by a very nice person at Ozisoft LTD, so I can't really expect to get more posters from that source.  Which means I have no more posters to give away currentlly.  So untill I find alternate source it is no go.  But I do intend to have a major competition when we reach 100000 hits.
