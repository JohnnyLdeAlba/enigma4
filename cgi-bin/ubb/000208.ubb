The last level shouldn't've been a level.  It was way too easy!  Well, time to get back on the subject...When you beat the game, it gives you the option of Start Game instead of Continue Game.  And, at the end, it says that Ecco was made immortal.  Does he get invincibility, or the "oh so powerful gift of gills"?  does anything strange happen in the second time through the game?  It'd be great if someone responded...OH yeah, I'm also known as rotten_yogurt, but I forgot the password to that...plus yogoat's easier to remember and type.

It's like in the first Ecco games, Ecco's sung is sung throughout time after Ecco defeated the Vortex.  In the new story his sung will be sung throughout time for defeating the foe.
