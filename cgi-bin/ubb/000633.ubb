I can't remember now which MP3s seemed to be so, but I can remember that wierd "Eel Chase Excerpt" MP3 - this one must be a pre-official version of the final Eel Chase in "Roaring Forces". You've got to listen to it. If you listen closely to the background you can recognize parts of the official Eel Chase, but like Dolphingirl told me, that wierd Guitars are totally different, and IMHO it sounds totally crap <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> But it's worth the download! Go to his Demo section and get it <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
