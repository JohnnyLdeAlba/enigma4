Just LOOK at that. It's amazing. Silverfin, you're a true artist.<Br> <Br> And there are two reasons I put that up on my own MB and not here. One, I'm not sure it'd show up, and two, this MB is incredibly slow on my comp. If I had to wait for that to load up here too I'd be here all night. So there you go. The Outlander in all her lonesome glory.<Br> <Br> There are TOO many good artists around here. First Reptyx and Crestoe, and now Silverfin. Man......<Br>

I cannot draw, paint, sculpt, whatever but if I could just capture the hundreds of images i can see in my mind's eye into some sort of material form, i would fuinally get to expereience the art of creating.  I guess until holographic mind projectoes are invented, its all gonna be stuck in my head.
