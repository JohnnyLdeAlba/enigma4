Nothing major but though, it would rock to have all of them...<p>I'd love to have those ones played in the cinematics after beating the bosses in Hanging Waters... When the water spheres explode, y'know. And also the Game Over music would be nice to have, I think have been in the Game Over screen only two times... I guess one best results in a computer game <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><p>Anyway, are you still in contact with Solly? Would be nice to get those, does anyone else remember songs?

In any case is it possable to get them in mp3 format? Since I have the little Real audio problem I mentioned....
