A||||0||Reptyx||Ecco Tides of Time MegaCD epilogue?
Z||000000||Reptyx||09-27-2000||04:58 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com||Does anyone know what the epilogue in Ecco ToT for MegaCD is like? Is it exactly the same as in the Megadrive version? What I'm really wondering is if Ecco really was lost in the end (it just says that he disappears *into* the stream of time). I know I've already said this, and I'm sorry if I'm being repetitive, it's just that I really want to know this because I'm working on an Ecco story.<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated...<br>
