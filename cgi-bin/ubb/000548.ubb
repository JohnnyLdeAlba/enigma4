Z||000000||Vortex_of_time||12-29-2000||11:02 PM||seastuff211@aol.com||I made a brand new Pokemon RPG site called "The Johto Journeys". (And for all you people, Im using HTML to make most of it, even though it is on expage)

Like my site, >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <A HREF="http://histronic.tripod.com">SonCo Boulevard</A> <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< (VISIT IT <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> )
Z||000005||Vortex_of_time||01-04-2001||12:45 AM||seastuff211@aol.com||Ok, Im useing expage for a reason, you can build pages really really fast (and with RPG sites that a HUGE factor), plus with HTML you can do tons of stuff with expage, most people just dont realize that. And you guys probably have a good point about posting the URL, so here it is: http://expage.com/johto1
