Z||000007||blackfin||11-25-2000||03:28 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Crestoe and Arkonviox, I am not bound by any oath to like Crestoe's artwork, and I no hope that Megz likes the pic but I personally don't like it.  Last time I checked I was allowed to express my opinion, expecially on my own website.
Z||000008||PsySonic||11-25-2000||09:36 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <p>Man! It sucks! It really sucks!<p>On the one hand, Blackfin is exaggerating on his relationship with megz - "only the best for my little sweetheart megz". Plus such a stupid comment like "this is my website and i can do here what i want"...<p>On the other hand Crestoe and Arkonviox offending Blackfin only because of his opinion. Everytime somebody says, Crestoes work was good you two enjoy and say thanks and everything. But when somebody says, man, you could've done it better you kick the sh*t out of him! ARGH!<p>I personally like megz picture but Crestoe doesn't ask for it so I actually shouldn't have asked for it...<p>I had to say that! Excuse me for this!
Z||000009||Coral||11-25-2000||09:38 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Will you guys knock it off! Megz picture is nice, okay!! Geez! A fight over a face pic?!<br>GOD! 
Z||000010||PsySonic||11-25-2000||09:59 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <p>No Coral, actually not because of the face pic itself, it is the behave of some people on this forum which starts this fight!
Z||000011||Coral||11-25-2000||10:02 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Geez! Now I have somebody correcting me!<br>You know what? I think I'll come back when this forum is peaceful again! Which will probably NEVER!<p><br>Good-bye all!
Z||000012||PsySonic||11-25-2000||10:11 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/psysonic.jpg"> <p>And this is what had to happen sooner or later - the first person leaving!<p>DO YOU ALL RECOGNIZE NOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS FORUM?!?<p>Coral, if you read this: I didn't want you to leave, that was never mentioned by me and never thought by me! You are one of the last people who can behave, so please stay here!
Z||000013||Coral||11-25-2000||10:23 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Its not you Psysonic, you're nice. Its just that I don't want to be in a place where there are lots of fighting! I saw that you wrote just when I was leaving and its not your fault Psysonic. <br>Want to talk to me?<br>Go on a Zelda site!<br>This is my FINAL post.<br>Good-bye.<p><br>
Z||000014||Eao||11-25-2000||10:29 AM||collprin@warwick.net||The megz looks like an Ithisaurid....<p>-Eao who wishe somone would get pissy over somthing for her.......but no...they just hate her work...<p>*wait!*<p>Where's my new face pic?<p>i guess i gotta fool around in my own photoshop.....
Z||000015||blackfin||11-25-2000||03:25 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||*sigh*  I was afraid of things like this happening, once a website gets big all the regulars (I include myself in this), get the opinion they can do what they like and things like this are a result.<p>I'm sorry to hear that Coral has left she was a nice person...<p>My appologes for not liking your face pic Crestoe but it looks very flat to me, not 3d like you work usually does, the comment about megz was ment to try and explain why I was being so hard on the pic, it wasn't supposed to be an insult...<p>The comment on this is my website and I should be able to do what I want was not really directed directlly at the comment about the picture but more a general expression of annoyance.  In the last few months people have been telling (not suggest, or asking) but telling me how I should do everything and since I don't like being bossed around at the best of times...  Well being told how to do things by people who some of which don't have a clue is starting to really get on my nerves and hence the outburst.<p>and as for my relationship with megz I suppose I am a little attached to her, I'm sorry for that but when you like somebody as much as I like megz it's hard not too. 
Z||000016||Delphi||11-25-2000||04:24 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Okay, I would like to say a few things.<p>I realize that I'm not always the easiest person to get along with. I try not to get in fights, but when I do, I usually apologize for them. <p>Blackfin and Megz, if you two are in love, then all the power to you and have fun.<p>About Crestoe's picture, it is very nice, I'm sure Megz liked it, and does she use it?<p>All these fights are pointless. Life is too short, you know. If someone is outright blatanly insulting your firmest beliefs, then I can understand a person getting mad enough to post some huge, long reply. However, fighting about a face pic or whether or not Blackfin should be with Megz or something like that (which I have decided to shut up about because it's their decision, true...), well, let it ride then. Otherwise, we get people leaving like Coral and getting pissed and stuff like that.

I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A FUCKING PICTURE AND FOR BLACKFIN CONCENT WHICH I COULD GIVE A DAMN ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!!! WASNT IT HIM WHO SAID "i dont care for anyones opinion right nowbut megzs."<br>Last starw...
Z||000018||Crestoe||11-25-2000||05:21 PM||crestoe@arkonviox.com||Sorry BLACKFIN that i couldnt make the picture any where toward "Megz Beauty", but how am i supposed to make a pic tto look as good as megz when niether you OR me knows what she looks like, you and me will always have one thing in common, and that is bieng able to see megzs real self in reality. for all you know, megz can be a couch pataetoe wieghing over 4000 lbs with SERIOUS problems. and if life is to short for fighting then LIFE IS TOO SHORT FOR WAISTING YER PATHETIC LIVES HAVING EMOTIONS ON YER COMPUTER TOWARDS A REALITY ENVOLVIONG THOSE LIVELESS LOSERS WHO WAIST THEIR REAL LIFES SOAKING ON THEIR COMPUTER WHEN THEY ARE FAILING IN REAL LIFE AS HUMAN BIENGS!!!<p>btw, evar reave....<br>are you from another website? an ezboard, i think i recognize you...
Z||000019||yogoat||11-25-2000||05:42 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||Erp!  this is all screwed up.  Coral's leaving, everyone's startin' sh** and takin' sides.....I'm just gonna sit back and watch, I personally think blackfin just didn't think first, and crestoe/arkonviox/xoivnokra are goin' a tad ballistic.  Maybe something funny will some out of this.

Z||000022||Pharphignewton||11-25-2000||06:25 PM||mailbox@aol.com||Not that it's any of my business, but one person has already left.  Do you really want the forum to empty out over a picture where the only person who's opinion matters is Megz?
Z||000023||Crestoe||11-25-2000||06:32 PM||crestoe@arkonviox.com||Its not the picture that started this,<br>Its blackfins relationship with a girl of 12 years of age living in america and his sudden carelessness for any of us at this site. There has been too many off topic discussions and too many fights and i have grown tired of it!
