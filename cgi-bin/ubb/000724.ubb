It appears that Appaloosa will have to revise its plans for a fully online sequel of the Dreamcast game, but what the PlayStation 2 outing has in store for fish-fans is tightly under wraps at Sega HQ.

I do think it is kind of funny how PS2's harware was old before it was frickin' released, though....  Sony should be ashamed of themselves, snuffing SEGA out with advertising and not much else....  Imagine what games we could have had if Dreamcast stayed alive.  I guess life isn't fair at all.

I have some Sega games for my Atari 2600 and they were better than most.  I think that the PS2 Ecco version will be just a port from the Dreamcast.  HeadHunter, MSR, and Ecco probably had the highest production value for Sega of Europe, and I doubt that they would let them go to waste.  I think after all the new systems have a strong user base, and Sega is back on their feet, then we might see a brand new Ecco.  One that will be online (like Sega said before, they are interested in bringing other franchises online after seeing the success of Phantasy Star Online).  Best thing to do it wait and see.  By the way Appaloosa has redone their site, it looks good.  Check it out <a href="http://www.appaloosacorp.com/html/">here</a>.

I dunno though, "SharkShark"...are you also known as "sharc" on other message boards?
Z||000008||SharkShark||03-29-2001||09:36 PM||scatpack@bellatlantic.net||Nope wrong person and I have never been to Ark's site.  SharkShark was an old Intellivision back in the day, and I found something cool too.  There was a game called Fathom made by Imagic somewhere in '82 for the Intellivision/Atari.  It is really similar Ecco.  I'm wondering if the people from Novatrade/Appaloosa got the idea from them because in Fathom you were a dolphin who could transform into other creatures to solve puzzles.  Its really cool.

I wonder if there are any ROMs or anything out there to play 'em?!? That'd be cool!
