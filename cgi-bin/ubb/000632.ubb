I want to know what everyone one else thinks should have been added, deleted, or picked up from previous ecco games to Ecco dotf. <p>Well, I think that the music was kinda wishy-washy. It was all right at some parts of the game, but overall it lacked the power that ToT held within its notes. Also...the Foe...<IMG SRC="indifferent.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="indifferent">:/<IMG SRC="smilie14.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="disgust"> Whats up with that? Ooooohhhhh...the Foe...now that is really frightening. Is it just me, or did the Queen look like Alien from the Victorian age or what? Finally, Im not sure how the creaters could do this, but ToT has a quality to it that makes me want to go back and play it, even after 7 years. I think its the mysterious feel to it. I dunno, cant quite explain it.  I did not like the water surface effects...ToT has better splash graphics.<br>Anyway, the good points are:<br>The evil dolphins...those bastards are awesome.  Needless to say, the graphics, but especially the sky, coral, and futuristic plants. <br>Like I said, Whatch'all think?

I think the music in Ecco TOT for Genesis was great, but it can't reach the CD quality of a Dreamcast or a Sega CD Ecco game, they have a much bigger underwater athmosphere! And DotF also fits the levels and level parts very well!<p>I didn't like most of the futuristic plants in Dolphin's Nightmare... They didn't look very good for me, like those white tubular coral things... And I didn't really like the idea of the houses for dolphins, too, with those little stones in front of them... I liked Island of Tranquility and Man's Nightmare better, the athmosphere in Man's Nightmare was really very catchy. The story part in there was also best. I think it's because the storywriter David Brin is a science fiction author and that part would fit him in many ways. It affected me most, I was sometimes really sad when I played, but got happier the more I knew that I can help those dolphins!<p>I liked the Asterite better, cause he had a more major role in the Ecco games! He was also more mysterious, cause nobody knows, where he actually comes from. The guardian doesn't really connect to the game, he is in contact with you by glyphs, but that is kind of wierd, cause how can he contact you in the different time zones? And I didn't really like the idea that he was <i>built</i> by humans and dolphins. I liked the idea that Humans and dolphins joined, but I'm glad that we never get to see any humans ingame cause that would make the game a lot worse. The only-underwater-athmosphere is the best thing about Ecco games!<p>I was kind of disappointed of the last part of the game, the one with the Foe... It was way too easy and actually had not such a big excitement like I thought and hoped it to be...<p>Well, but I don't want to make it bad, cause I really loved this awesome game! I'd still give it 5/5 simply because of its brilliantness, graphical and musical best work ever and stuff, you know what I mean **: )
