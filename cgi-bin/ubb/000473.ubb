Z||000002||dragonboy||12-07-2000||08:14 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i have had a similar problem.  sometimes i go in and every time i do it, it will stop at the authenticating user id or something like that and then red letters pop up saying "disconnected from irc.icq.com"  i get irritated, so what i do is close all my windows and disconnect from my browser and then come back on and try again.  i usually have a 100% success ratio.  then again cortex, it may be something with the server more likely.
