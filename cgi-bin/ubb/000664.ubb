Don't get shocked by some wierd people around here, you will get used to them <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><br>I guess you are talking about the fonts at the top of each page. They are from the Genesis/Mega Drive Ecco games! You can play them via Emulation by downloading an emulator and the games at such emulation sites as  <A HREF="http://www.emux.com" TARGET=_blank>http://www.emux.com</A>  If you need more detailed instructions, ask us <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><br>Have fun around here!
