You should take a look at this site when you have some free time, there are lots of pics and info about all PD games. The only problem is: when will you have free time??? <IMG SRC="confused.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="confused"> <br>

Z||000005||Riveler||06-14-2001||11:15 PM||riveler@uol.com.br||Panzer Dragoon is the best shooting game I've ever played, Yogoat! And you are right: we ride a dragon's back shooting the enemies around. Thera are 3 versions and the third is a action/RPG. I like all of them!

I remember I looked up info on all the games I was playing so far, but the first one for which I found fanfic for was NiGHTS... thus sparking my own fanfic career =P <p>I wrote a Panzer Dragoon Zwei fic once. >_< God it was  **** .
