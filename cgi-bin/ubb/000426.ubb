I got hooked on the game, so hooked that I wanted to share my obsession with other people. So I joined up with the old Squaresoft Fan HQ Forum. I dunno if any of you remember the place, but it's a community that will always have a place in my heart.<p>Anyways, while I was there, I met a guy that came to be a close friend. After awhile, it got beyond close friendship feelings, and we hooked up.......<p>Even though he was in Britain and I was in Texas. That's a loooooong way. We sent e-mails, talked on the phone, but had never met. <p>Then we met, about six months after the initial meeting. and clicked even more. After a few more flights and meeting like this, I moved in with him. And you know what?<p>It's been over a year since we got together, and everything is still going strong. So Blackfin, Megs, don't let anyone tell you it won't work because of distance or any of that. They CAN work.<p>Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.

Im sure that at times online relationships can work, but in the case where you are working with a 18 guy half way across the damn globe and another who is even too young to go see a PG-13 movie by herself, well you can se my point as to that what i se is pretty fuck'n stupid...<p>And thats my 1 dime and a piece of lint...

I've never been in a chat room before...<IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">
Z||000004||blackfin||11-25-2000||03:54 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Ok Evar I'll fill you in.  I met a nice girl called megz in the chatroom and we got talking and ended up really liking each other.  At this point all my 'friends' except for a few people started flamming me and attacking the relationship at every point because they feel that the age difference and the fact that we are so far apart makes the relationship bad.  They fail to take into account that Megz is very mature for her age and that it is our decision and that they have no real right to try to dictate the personal lives of me and megz and do not think about how me and me megz feel about each other. This is our lives, our decision, what right does any one of them have to else have to tell us what to do?  They also have this impression that I for some reason am legally bound to spend so many hours talking to them everyday, dispite the fact I am very busy and still somehow manage to put hours of work into this website and spend time talking to everybody.  If I so choose to spend more time with a person, for some reason I am being an 'a** h***' and must spend more time talking to other people.  I've just about had enough of this...  I really do feel taken for granted by a lot of people these days.  I'm ordered around like a slave, 'Do this so that...', I spend hours doing things for some people and they don't even thank me.  I maintain this website because I enjoy it, but currentlly... Well if I didn't have such patience and a thick skin I would be long gone.  In my opinions some of the people who attack me should take a long hard look at themselves, there are people out there now that I have very little respect left for indeed....  You call you're selves my 'friends' if I picked out a list or people I think act like frieends towards me, well there currentlly wouldn't be that many people on it...
Z||000005||Debaser13||11-25-2000||06:30 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||No problem Blackfin. Did I mention this guy is two years younger than me?<p>I rest my case. <p>Oh, and these aren't isolated incidents. I have two other friends online who are involved in a relationship. The girl lives in Michigan and the guy lives in the U.K.<br>And they've been together for over a year too. And I used to know another couple where the guy was in New Zealand and the girl was in New Mexico. And all these relationships have worked. So there you go. Do what you want to do, and don't listen to naysayers. Love crosses cutural boundaries, as well as age, at times.

I'm one of your friends, right? Anyway, I don't have an internet boyfriend. Never have, never will. <br>I'm surprised Blackfin didn't ban anybody yet.
Z||000007||Eao||11-25-2000||10:36 AM||collprin@warwick.net||yeah...my friend who says love isn't the most imortant thing in the world and that she was "happy being single" was just hiding behind true sadness. and she bashes me for being vocal has a British lover.<p>I fucking have noone and i hat all this shit....mabye i should buy myself a Playstation 2 and make my self a nuke and send it flying god knows where because the longer i am without love the worse i'll be.<p>i hate it all......mabye i am right and "love" dosen't exist.<p>My friend dumped her hard to reach b/f, cuz he went to college because she wanted this crush......i have noone...i'm not the like the rest of the girls who think they are in love with every hottie they see.  If you are all so great i'll give you the only one i actually want's adress abd phone number.  YOU tell him to move back to nj and for me only and dump whom ever he is with now, beccause i'm waisting too much heart liking him.
Z||000008||Debaser13||11-25-2000||10:47 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||I'm not saying that relationships are always rosy, especially long-distance ones. It's hard being away from someone for so long. But the good outweighs the bad.<p>And Blackfin, I've seen you giving Megs Pod Leader status and saying that Crestoe's pic wasn't good enough for her.....I know you love her very much, and I know how it is in the begininng of relationships when you want the world to know how great the other person is...but I have to warn you, doing stuff like the above is very likely to drive people away. It's showing favortism, and when you run a webpage or a forum you have to forgo that if you want people to stick around.<p>Personally, I don't care what you do -- it's your life and your page. But you might want to think about it.<p>And I wish you both the best -- nice to see couples in love. Awwwwwwwwww <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
Z||000009||Eao||11-25-2000||12:01 PM||collprin@warwick.net||Bah........nobody cares for the lonly.....you just look down apon them.......mabye i should just dive into an OL one so i can be like every one....*wishes she were girly and super fema nd pretty* my kind dosent' get loved, so i have every right to hate.<p>oh boo-hoo so i'm not in love with gay ppl and i think there are sick...so what<br>noone loves or accepts me for me why should i?<p>my back is crooked and i'm near flat....what guy wants that?<p>I think it's better to be be dead.
Z||000010||blackfin||11-25-2000||03:10 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||No Coral you haven't been flamming me, but I'm not going to comment on who I do and don't think are acting like friend towards me, tell people things like that would just cause more problems.<p>Thanks for everything Debaser, you have been talking a lot of sense, a lot more than some people who think themselves 'experts' on love.  I think you are right about what you said about me wanting to show the world how great megz is and it causing problems, but I have now made more ops for the forum and when I finish the forum at the end of the year the old status will change completely.  I do recongize that I have been annoying me people with my relationship and I will try to keep it more out of the way.<p>Eao I do think you are wrong, you may not have found the right guy yet, but I don't believe you are as anywhere near as ugly as you think you are.  You will find love sooner or later.<p>Oh yes and a note to the 'doom and gloomers' I have explored my feelings and make my decision, I'm not listening to anything you say anymore all you are doing is geting on my nerves and wasting your time.  
Z||000011||Midevil Barbarian||11-25-2000||05:40 PM||barbarian8ieght@arkonviox.com||Preteens and preadults.<br>Oh blackfin you will never understand...<br>I dont care for anyones opinions here, i have been so tired of the situation as of late 'her prince' 'his angel' 'did i mention that someone doesnt understand that that all isd a bunch of bull shit!!!'<br>'wheres megz, im worried about megz' 'did i mention that no one cares but you!"<br>'i am more than willing to give up my site for her'<br>'did i mention that you can ruin yer li8fe as much as you want, this website is falling apart cuz of your carelessness, people are leaving and making fun of you behind yer back! and alls you can do is let it happebn or ban them from your site, but you have turned into an asshole blackfin and im not affraid to say it in your face!'<p>blackfin, you are an asshole!
Z||000012||Ecco the barbarian||11-25-2000||05:46 PM||barbarian8ieght@hotmail.com||Oh and blackfin,<br>you dont have my respect anymore,<br>but i can say that because you wouldnt care nontheless.<br>and by that, you are losng friendship in all of us, i hope you love your misserable little life that has disambowled into a train wreck, and like most people already are, im thinking of leaving, your little sheraid has went on long enough to want me to come over ther and kick your ass and show you how much i am annoyed!<br>Farewell.....blackfin<br>I might just be around sumwhat later but you will remember this message when i am gone.
Z||000013||megz||11-25-2000||06:01 PM||marhew@bellsouth.net||maybe i should leave...if i dont i will fell guilty for causing alot of trouble....
Z||000014||blackfin||11-26-2000||01:47 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||No megz don't leave...  I feel that this is all my fault and I take full responsibilty for the mess.  Don't feel guilty.
Z||000015||Coral||11-26-2000||03:05 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Hey! Megz is an Outcast again.
Z||000016||dragonboy||11-27-2000||01:00 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i have one thing to say, chill out!  my god, i think life is herd enough as it is the squabble over little insignifigant things such as this.  black and megz:  find your happiness.  I just hope neither of you get hurt in the end.  And stay megz i like you.  I'm so happy to hear of your relationship debaser, its a rare beautiful thing. and eao, i saw your picture, you are definitely not ugly.  and boobs mean nothing.  some guys like other things more.  like me, i like eyes and legs.  i hate big boobs.  oh, this is not a come-on or anything.  you should realize you are much better than you think you are. It is most likely an issue of self-esteem.  well know this, i think you are attractive and i have no doubt that you will find someone. and despite what is going on with your peers, having a companion is wonderful, but having one cuz one thinks they should have one, is a wrong menatlity.  i've ben siongle for 3 years cuz my last relationship was quite bad.  it was based on sex and drugs. It was fun, but it had absolutely no substance and it wound up being a realy shallow, unfulfilling relationship.  the only reason i ended it was she was stealing from me.  but it was bound to end.  i've been a little gun-shy since then and i feel when the  right one comes along, things will progress as they are meant to.  everyone, you must feel and think in life.  do not let one outweigh the other.  we are all friends here in a manner of speaking, we should try and undersdtand what each other is going through, where each one comes from. that's why i like chattibng with you guys, i learn more about each one of you, and thus increase my knowledge of people in general.  its easy to judge when you don't really know someone, but try switching lives and circumstances with another.  maybe then one realize's that life is just circumstantial and that all things happen for a reason.  we are who we are, only tolerance and understanding will create aworld where we can unify under a common goal, love.  real love, not necesarily the physical kind.  i know not all of you undersdtand this well, but my life experiences have taught me many great lessons.  i hope someday, you guys will see this too.  well gotta get to class.....
