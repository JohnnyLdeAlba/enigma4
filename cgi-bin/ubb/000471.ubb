Blackfin made a poll asking what your favorite characters were, but he left out some key players.  Also, when a poll is in this form, you can explain WHY you like that character.<p>Mine has to be Pilot.  Almost everything he says is funny, and I like how he followed Ecco around for two levels.

Original character or what!<p>Pilot : Yeah, just for the fact every line he said was great <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> , and he helped you through a few levels too. <p>Bad Guys<p>Vortex Queen : She looks cool<p>Mutaclone + Guards : These guys are some serious dolphins! Any Dolphin that carries missiles and shark spikes on his spine, gets my vote for "Hardest Guy of the year".<p>Groups<p>The Clan Guards : Lair of Evil's foolish guards, can't tell the difference between a weak tiny miniscule dolphin, and a massive tusked, hulk of a sea creature. Hell, we'll just let this little sabatour into the main printer machinery. They need their Sonar tested... If they're relying on Mutaclone to identify what's what, it's a wonder they got anywhere!<p>The resistance : I actually thought the whole saga of 'Anguish of Dearth' etc was really cool. The whole "Get through the gate not be seen" and "Free the prisoner" and "Kill the sharks" was really cool. And the characters around were cool to.<p>
