I have to say though the game was really good one of the best games I've played in a long time. My favorite worlds were the dolphin future and the world ruled by humans. I'm not going to give away anything else but the game was relly good best one on dreamcast and I'm relly hoping for a sequel.

And you still havent beaten it! Well I guess you know that soul reavers to be continued..anyways thats great! @_@
