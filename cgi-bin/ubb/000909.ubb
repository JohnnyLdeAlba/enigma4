Guys, here's the deal: a friend of mine pointed out to me an article that was released either yesterday or today...about the very thing we're all here for...ECCO THE DOLPHIN!!! Yes...you heard me right, Ecco has hit mainstream once again! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> I'm so happy!!! Now...all you out there that don't care for the PS2, don't get too mad...for at least it looks as if the sequel to Defender of the Future will be released! Here's the link to the article at FGNonline (taken from the UK trade magazine, MCV):<p> <A HREF="http://www.fgnonline.com/playstation2/news/19022.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.fgnonline.com/playstation2/news/19022.html</A> <p>It looks like Sony scored a great deal with Sega, which will involve the release of seven titles...one of which is our beloved, ECCO THE DOLPHIN! Unfortunately, the article isn't specific about whether or not it's the version that's currently out (DotF), or the sequel to it. My guess though, is that it's the sequel! I mean, why would a newer system release a game that's already existing? Even if that is the case, at least you can bet on a sequel coming out...that's for sure! Otherwise, why release a game that's already out...that will be dead in sequels?!? Catch my drift... <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ...so guys...this is perhaps what we've been waiting for...some news about another Ecco game!!!<p>The only problem, is for those of you who really dislike Sony's PS2. If that's the system it comes out for...I don't suppose you guys will be happy one bit. I am crazy happy...well...just because it's nice to know Ecco games will be continuing...and not stopped. Look at it this way. If it does infact come out for the PS2...when the newer systems come out the end of this year (Gamecube and X-Box)...that will drive the price of the PS2's down. I dunno if that's any kind of consolation or not...but like I said...I'm just glad the title is even being mentioned! It's a shame though that we as customers can no longer count on the same system for the game series we like.<p>Anyway, I'm happy... <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> ...it looks like Ecco won't die afterall!!!<p> <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">  <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">  <IMG SRC="smilie5.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="slit eyes">  <IMG SRC="smilie8.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="sick">  <IMG SRC="smilie9.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="glowing">  <IMG SRC="smilie11.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="glasses1">  <IMG SRC="smilie16.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="demented">  <IMG SRC="smilie22.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="evil">  <IMG SRC="smilie32.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="open heart">  <IMG SRC="smilie38.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="monkey">  <IMG SRC="smilie41.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rainbow">  <IMG SRC="smilie42.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rolling">  <IMG SRC="smilie44.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rolling">  <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup">  <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup">  <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup">

I was so excited when I read the news, I didn't look very carefully before I posted this...hehe...so I'm sorry guys! Looks like Riveler and I have different links though, so that's something to check out if you haven't seen both yet! Again...sorry... <IMG SRC="smilie16.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="demented"> 
Z||000002||BlackDragon||06-21-2001||07:06 AM||blackfox71@yahoo.com||Like you, I'm happy that Ecco will survive Sega's *ahem* demise as a platform game company and that a system with almost limitless finacial backing, (not unlike X Box) is picking up where Sega left off. Hopefully it will be the sequal that is brought out, not JUST a DoF version for the PS2.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> 
Z||000003||blackfin||06-21-2001||07:52 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||IT's ok dg, I think almost anybody would have done the same in your situation, it is awesome to hear a new ecco game is coming... ^_^
Z||000004||Trace Kyshad||06-21-2001||12:03 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Bah, not even our creator him/herself could tear through the skies and tell me I had to buy a PS2, I wouldn't go near one of 'em<p>I also extremely doubt that the PS2 will be the only thing seeing our aquatic friend <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
Z||000005||Riveler||06-21-2001||01:49 PM||riveler@uol.com.br||Hey, Dolphingirl! There`s no need to `sorries`! I can understand your excitement <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> <p>I`m just a little confused: some time ago I did swear to buy every Ecco game I could and I also promised to myself NEVER buy a Sony product again in m life! What will I do now? What? What? <IMG SRC="confused.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="confused"> 
Z||000006||GTK||06-21-2001||02:14 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Easy, Riveler. <p>Buy the game, but not the console. <p><IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000007||vantid||06-21-2001||07:37 PM||vantid@gmx.co.uk|| <IMG SRC="laugh.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh"> Not very good in the advice department GTK!  <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"> Now then riveler youll never buy another sony product ever? not even a tv  or stereo or any of that good stuff? Sony is high quality electronix y'know. Or perhaps im just nit pickin ya a little too much eh? Yes i dearly hope its a new game all over cuz my mom is gonna buy the PS2. Hey wait a tic theres your solution Riveler! Have someone ELSE buy it for you! There, problem solved. 
Z||000008||dolphingirl||06-22-2001||05:25 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Heheh! Yeah, I knew there'd be people that would flat out say they won't buy a PS2 even for a new ecco game...<IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well">...but I tend to think more along the lines of what Trace said. I'll bet sooner or later, down the road...it'll become cross-platform whenever possible. So, if you absolute can't stand to buy the PS2...perhaps in due time, it'll come out for a different console as well! 
Z||000009||Riveler||06-22-2001||11:36 PM||riveler@uol.com.br||Thank you, GTK and Vantid! Now I know where NOT to ask good advices <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
