I doubt Ecco Online will be able to make it out before the Dreamcast is totally dead, so it has to go somewhere...unless they stopped the project altogether.  I actually hope that it will come out on all the new systems.

This will sure be a problem for Appaloosa since they announced so much about the online game modes... But I really hope that they will bring out the second game for the Dreamcast, because I only the DC for Sonic and Ecco games, and if there are really only 3 or 4 games for me I will freak out that I spent so much money for it!<br>I hope Sega will concentrate on one console to publish games on it when the DC is dead... I won't buy 2 or 3 consoles only to play games with my favorite characters... <IMG SRC="smilie3.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="mad">
