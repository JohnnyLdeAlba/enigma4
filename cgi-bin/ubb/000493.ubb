A||||7||Ecco The Dolphin||Gaming Questions

Here are a few of mine.<p>Sonic Team:  I'm a large Sonic fan and like it about the same as I like Ecco games.<p>Novotrade/Appaloosa:  Although they made better games as Novotrade, they're still good.<p>No Cliche:  Ha Ha Ha!  I AM the true TOY COMMANDER!  Oh yeah, nevermind....<p>AM2:  Virtua Fighter creators, I like Fighters megamix.  They've also made good racing games.<p>AM3:  They made the Virtual On games, one of the most realistic(in terms of having characters have different HP and armor and weapon skills), balanced, and best 3D fighting games.

(PLUG)<A HREF="http://histronic.tripod.com" TARGET=_blank>SonCo Boulevard</A>  You know you wanna click it, heck, it even opens up in a new window, so you don't have to worry about pressing the back butoon on your browser a million times to get back here!  How cool is that?(/PLUG)<br>Anyway, If I wanna use the little grey cells and hear a cool story, I play Ecco, if I wanna be excited and use hand eye coordination skill, I play Sonic.  So, there is no strong preferance over the other.<p>I also love Smilebit, the inventors of the cellshading technique and Jet Grind Radio!  I rented it, and I can't wait till the holidays before I can play it again!  How do I know I'm getting it, you ask?  It's the only game I asked for, and there is a mysteriously CD shaped present under my tree....  Oh, my Grandma told me I'm getting StarLancer.<p>3D Realms, creator of the smart shootin, big pimpin' Duke Nukem, definitely.  Yes, I'm the only person in the world who likes Sonic, Ecco, and Duke Nukem at the same time.  I'm kind of pissed at 3D Realms for dissing the Dreamcast and working for Sony, but my PC and Atomic version of Duke keep me entertained when my Dreamcast and watching Ecco move his butt up and down don't.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">  Hey, that's a great quote!<p>Whoever made Sanfrancisco Rush games, especially 2049, has my approval.<p>Those are the only guys I am fiercely loyal to.  So remember, the only good Sonic games are Sonic Team Sonic games.  As if the comparison between Sonic 2 and Waku Waku Sonniku Potoka wasn't a big enough to illustarate what I mean, you are drugged.  The again, there is Sonic Team Jr. and a slew of other fan game makers.... oh, I talk too much.

It still amazes me how they made this game so fun.<p>Valve : Half-Life. Even though Half-Life is 2 years old, Valve continues to keep the fanbase alive by releasing new mods, features, and helping out mod teams.<p>Novatrade : I haven't played DOF yet, so my vote on Appaloosa is pending, but back in the Novatrade days, they did great on the ecco series.<p>X-Crispy

But most his quotes are from Evil Dead... Except, "I'll rip you head off, and..."<p>Ahem<p>Hmmm, Bizzard, for making WarCraft, Sonic Team, for existing, Lucasarts for SW and the Monkey Island Legacy, and the odd other one...<p>Outcast's a good game too, anyone remember who made that one?

Z||000007||Debaser13||12-14-2000||12:44 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Squaresoft for making the FF series,Xenogears, CT, and all those other great games, of course. I think Working Designs *the production team behind Lunar* would come in a close second for their excellent translations....And Novotrade for the original Ecco games.
