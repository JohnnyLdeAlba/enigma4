Z||000000||Debaser13||11-05-2000||06:48 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||This is yet another story I'm working on. Feel free to tell me if some of it needs to be changed. And YES, I am working on the Ecco fic, give me time.<Br> <Br>"...Beware the fearsome jub-jub bird, <br>And shun the fruminous Bandersnatch!" <br>Lewis Carrol, "Jabberwocky" <p><br>The wind howled. And the Bandersnatches answered it. <p>When the people of Icicle Inn heard the ominous wailing from the snowy fields around their small village, they <br>locked their doors tighter and shivered. Bandersnatches were the most feared creatures on the Northern <br>Continent, outside of the mutated beasts that roamed the North Crater. Children cowered under their covers and <br>hoped that the fearsome beasts wouldn't burst into their rooms and eat them up. Travellers told terrifying <br>tales of being attacked and almost devoured by the canids. Tracks as large as a man's hand were found around <br>the foothills, and it wasn't uncommon to find the half-devoured carcase of some unfortunate young Chocobo out <br>on the plains, grim testament to the harsh environment that all the creatures here lived in. <p>But sometimes the truth depends on who is telling the story. <p>****** <p>The wolf-like creature raised it's nose to the icy wind and sniffed. Something warm had been here ahead of it. <p>Something alive. <p>Something that would be good to eat. <p>Encouraged by the scent of prey ahead, the young female trotted on, nose to the snowy ground, paying little <br>attention to her surroundings. She had several pups to feed waiting at her den far back in the mountains, close <br>to the famous Icicle Inn hot springs. Food was scare, and she had many mouths to feed, so the female had trekked <br>to the fields, searching for sustenance for herself and the hungry brood that waited at the den. <p>In this harsh environment, food was never easy to come by. But at this time of year, deep into winter, things <br>got rough. The female was showing the signs of malnutrition. Her grey pelt, usually shining silver, was now <br>listless and dry. The skin over her ribs was stretched tight as drum leather. The pads on her great paws <br>were bleeding from repeated contact with the jagged crust of the snow. But none of this was as bad as the <br>hunger. Anything would do to eat. Usually she and her kind would not touch carrion, disdaining already dead <br>animals for fresh meat. But if she had come upon a frozen Jumping at that moment that had been there from the <br>time of the Cetra on, the malnourished creature would not have hesitated to devour it. <p>Trotting on tirelessly, knotty muscles bulging under her ragged coat, the Bandersnatch soon came to a shallow <br>valley inbetween a craggy spur of the mountains that encircled the area. A small grove of firs stood ahead, and <br>there, her senses told her, her much sought after prey was resting. She slowed from a run to a slow, cautious <br>trot and approached the woods. Almost at once, a flurry of snow was thrown up and out burst a half grown yellow <br>chocobo, a whirl of canary on the whiteness of the snow. <p>Instantly the Bandersnatch was in pursuit, a streak of platinum running level with the canary. She was careful <br>of the bird, though. When cornered, Chocobos could give injuring blows with their giant claws, and all the <br>female needed now was to be injured miles from her pups. But this kill was easy. A lightning quick flash of <br>fangs in feathers, a frightened wark, a gush of crimson, and the bird was stretched out on the snow before her, <br>neck soaked in rufous liquid that made the snow steam. <p>The Bandersnatch tore into the stringy flesh with a frightning ravenousness. She had been well nigh starved <br>for the past few days, and the smell of blood was intoxicating. After a few harried moment of frenzied feeding, <br>however, the memory of the hungry Banderpups waiting back in the mountains came to her. Tearing a haunch away <br>from the body with her razor sharp fangs, the female staggered back from the steaming body and began to make <br>her way towards the pass and the way home. <p>Halfway to the opening, however, a wind blew up from the small forest and eddied around the Bandersnatch's <br>pointed muzzle. The smell carried on the wind caused her to drop the haunch and whirl to face the woods. <br>Lips wrinkled back, teeth glinting like ivory, the female gave the woods a rictus grin and crouched in fear, <br>snarling. Her hackles stood on end, a desperate attempt to make her look larger to whatever danger was lurking <br>in the shadow of the trees. <p>This danger, however, was too great to bluff away with bared teeth and fluffed up fur. After an ominous moment <br>of silence, the world seemed to explode. Out from the trees burst a gigantic Behemoth that had been forced by <br>hunger from the Crater to these lower reigons, much like the Bandersnatch herself. But there the similarities <br>ended. The Behemoth was about three times as big as the Banderess, with onyx claws that were nearly as long as <br>her head and curved like sabers. Purple hair covered a muscular frame, and the sunken eyes in the absurdly tiny <br>head were filled with hate and hunger. The smell of chocobo blood had drawn it here, and in the woods it had <br>waited. In three bounds it had reached the Banderess. When she launched herself at the creature's throat, it <br>knocked her out of the air with a frightningly swift blow and began to maul and rip the creature with it's <br>gigantic claws and teeth before she could get back to her feet. <p>A cry of pain and a final howl, desperately calling her brethren to come and help, were all that got out of <br>the Bandersnatch's throat before it was ripped to pieces by the hungry Behemoth. By the time several other <br>Bandersnatch reached the valley in response to her cry, all that was left was a large swarth of trampled, <br>bloodied snow and a few tufts of grey and dun fur. Not even the chocobo carcase was left; the Behemoth had <br>taken care of that too. The other Bandersnatch snuffed about the battlefield confusedly and soon wandered away. <br>There was nothing more they could do, and it was doubtful that they could've saved the Banderess even if they <br>had gotten there earlier. Soon it began to snow again, pulling a white pall over the patch of ruffled ground, <br>and in an hour the signs of battle were gone as completely as if they had been erased by a giant hand. <p>****** <p>

Z||000010||dragonboy||11-30-2000||06:35 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||remember, xiovnokra is the person arkon uses to communicate with when he is not in a good mood.  the shit he says when he is xiovnokra is nothing but trash.  for example, that evil post about people spending too much time in the chat which eventually spawned a big fight. and now saying how this post has nothing to with ecco. i think if arkon wishes to be xiovnokra, he should stay in his own site and stir up trouble there.  oh and about things not dealing with ecco, maybe arkon should consider changing his site name to "www.thisisallaboutme,arkonviox,andnothingto dowithecco.com"  capiche? oh wait your spanish backround not italian....entiendes?

This is exactly what I was talking about in that post, "Is it just me..."! And, you frickin people should lay off always talking like there's only <i>two</i> people here that try to pick fights! That's a bunch of bull shit if I've ever seen any! Some of you do the same shit too, and don't deny it! [i]*sighs*[i/] <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="roll eyes">
Z||000012||dragonboy||11-30-2000||08:26 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||don't forget... some people enjoy starting the fights, it gives them the attention they so desperately crave.  and i am guilty of following in the small quarrels, i admit.  but perhaps, the fighting would cease a bit quicker if the starters would stop.  funny, in real life, i can ignore a situation where a fight may occur, but here its hard.  after all, when fight occurs in the real world, it ends and usually never is heard of again and involves a few people.  here its posted for everyone to see,for as long as the site is alive.  so maybe the responsible parties should stop doing the same stuff over and over and over.  because it keeps those like me keep responding and responding.  i'll admit it, you insult this site, you insult a piece of me (i'm sure black feels it more).  I ignored it for awhile, but it kept getting brought up.  Yes, accept it, on this site and any other there will always be a million off-topic posts.  stop complaining about it, you-know-who, we heard you the first 500 times.

Z||000016||dragonboy||12-01-2000||05:34 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i only wanted your alter ego, voix..whatever away.  his vibes are nothing but pure negativity.  whining, huh? well perhaps you should consider them more than mere utterances; i believe what i say.  so you think creating discontent is interesting?  how sad... 
Z||000017||dragonboy||12-01-2000||06:01 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||oh, and if you had any honor, you would show some appreciation to your brother and rename your url arkonvioxandcrestoe.com or arkonviox+crestoe.com somthing like that.  he  busts his ass working for you not mention other people as well.
