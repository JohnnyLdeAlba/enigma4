I had to watch my parents bury her too while me and Buddy were in tears!<p>I did have a gerbil that lived for about...2..3 years. That gerbil seemed like it rotted alive! I mean nobody would come in my room because he stunk up the room and each time I cleaned the cage, it would smell <br>after a few minutes!<br>I'm a little upset too because somebody called my face pic ugly! I'm trying REALLY hard to hold all my anger in!

I'm trying to introduce face pics to that Zelda site so I put up mine for an example. I tried to be as polite as I could after he/she called my face pic ugly. I didn't want to flame anybody because maybe he saw an X thing or something. I'll put up my Sabra pic after this. Maybe they'll like that one better.

Shame about yours <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"><p>Coral? Someone called your face pics ugly? Some freaked out artistic-less foolish fool of fools called your face pic ugly?<p>*Collapses*
