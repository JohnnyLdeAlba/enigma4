Then when it stretches out its arm again, it'll throw a little cluster of bubbles... catch it and you get the Hunter Song. Use it like charge sonar in the ring level.

The magic arm is that Vortex larvae down in that cave all by itself.  Like Reptyx said, fire ONE charge sonar at it.  If you accidentally kill it, go away and come back and he should be there.  By the way, use the Hunter Song too often and it runs out...
