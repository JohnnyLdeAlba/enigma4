Shame, cool people there, although most of them also reside at SHQ, so hey!<p>I'm still in that competition with NoOman and some other cool artists... I've no chance, but that's down to Blaze.<p><br>As for the Pic, Excellent! Nice Lens Flare too! and the texture line-y things (For loss of better words) is cool!
