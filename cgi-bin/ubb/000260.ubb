Then I fix the printing machine, go back to the clam and change the setting to three marks. Then, I do the same thing, press for a red ball and close it then open it, but the dye won't go in the centre bit of the clam. It does go inside the clam, but rolls to the edge. This sometimes happens when I initially try to get a basic mark too - please help, I've got so far to give up now!
