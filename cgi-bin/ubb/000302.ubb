I am still on the bit after you defeat the Abyss of Inferno Boss and you activate all the tubes and sing to the bird, because I don't where the birdy goes. But don't fear, I'm rushing to the walkthrough now! Ijust wondered, are all the levels fighting bosses from now on? Is HW the last normal level? Please tell!!!! PS is the mutaclone hard cos shucks abyss of inferno is not! If ya leave him be he just gets to close to the bomb things and hurts himself!

Thats part of Ecco though -  it would be dull if it was easy. Perpetual Fluidity, thats a very annoying level, I just swam round changing all the lights until I gotr it right. The levels get better from now on, Hanging Waters is great but not easy and occasionally frustrating.

I haven't really bothered with that, it looks a lil dull. Maybe tommorrow.....
