Z||000000||Reptyx||10-13-2000||03:26 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx_h.jpg"> <br>Has anyone noticed that the epilogue in Japanese Ecco: Tides of Time is different?<p>I'm not good enough at Japanese to translate it properly, but it mentions the Asterite, and that Ecco's dolphin-friends had told him that the marks on his head are a sign of his destiny... and so on... it doesn't mention the Vortex at all.<p>So... anyone here good at Japanese?

Good to see you back, I was beginning to wonder where you'd gone....<Br> <Br> And that picture is great. Did you do it ? It looks like one of the dolphins from the Dolphin's Nightmare scenario....<Br>
Z||000002||Reptyx||10-13-2000||04:08 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx.jpg"> <br>Thanks Debaser! Here's the full version of the pic. I made it in acrylics. I was inspired by the outcasts of Dolphin's Nightmare, but mainly I just wanted a green reptilian dolphin... ^_^

Z||000010||Debaser13||10-15-2000||12:19 PM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||O.K. guys, I've got good news and bad news.<Br> <Br> Good news is, he <i> CAN </I> translate this. The bad news is, it's not spaced properly, and, as he so eloquently put it, it's a "Pain in the ass" to go through and space all of it as he's translating. So if someone could get a properly spaced copy, we could get a translation. Because I sure as heck don't wanna be a pain in the ass to this guy...<Br>

Z||000015||The Entity||10-16-2000||06:20 PM||boblamont@mac.com||IMHO, that's not half bad. It's not even a quarter bad! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Z||000017||Histronic||10-17-2000||09:54 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||That doesn't explain WHY he used the time machine though, or it does, it doesn't get the point across.  It's just a lot of babble, but it does make sense.<p>I originally thought that Ecco went into the future, but Blackfin says that's impossible.  My next guess is Ecco wanted to become a time hopper, and wanted to explore everything.
Z||000018||Reptyx||10-18-2000||03:41 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx_h.jpg"> <br>Histronic: I had hoped there was a meaning in it that didn't get through in my bad translation.<br>I thought Ecco might have used the time machine to follow the Vortex Queen into the past, but that's just my own guess, nothing related to the Japanese epilogue.
Z||000019||Coral||10-18-2000||04:02 PM||ntraver@epix.net||  <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  My guess is that Ecco became an extreme vortex exterminator and followed the Vortex Queen to kill her, then find the asterite again and go back to the present again. MAYBE!!!
Z||000020||blackfin||10-18-2000||11:30 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I like the translation Reptyx, sounded perfect to me, I'll put this up on the interstign things page later.
