Also note what sea creature you'd like next to the resipe.i took them from screen shots(example:  only one person can have the foward facing swordfish from ecco jr...and only 1 can have a left 3rd quarter facing blowsish.)  I could update if/when i get some submissions, and i'll may mention who has the level.<p>mind you orginal resipies and ones adapted from books are premitted......but i'd (i will) "test" orginal resipies first,(feed it to the dog....if it dies, then i'd worry...j/k)  na......try it on friends and fam, and don't let betty crocker get a hold of it.....sell it to her, make millions and give me a little more than half *evil laughter" ><IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p><br>what i have.....erk.....@_o<p><font color="Moccasin"><center>Ecco da phin<br><p><br>Home bay's home fries*eao*<br>Medusa  bay<br>The Undercaves<br>The Vents<br>The Lagoon's kid-safe drink*eao*(if u wish to help ok)<br>Ridge Water<br>Open Ocean's<br>        <br>Ice Zone<br>Hard water's freezer pops*eao*<br>Cold Water's icy desert*eao*<br>Island Zone<br>Deep Zone<br>The Marble Sea<br>The Library<br>Deep city's deep dip *eao*<br>City of Forever<br>Jurassic Beach<br>Pterandon pond-i had in mind some kind of porkchops<br>Origin Beach<br>Trilobite Circle's coffee cake ring*eao*<br>Dark Water's- chocolate cake *owned by eao*<br>The Tube<br>Welcome To The Machine<br>The Last Battle<br>Ecco's<br>Asterites's<br>Vortex Queen's<br>Big Blue's Big Blue Drink*eao*<br>         Volcanic Reef <br>         Ship Grave Sea <br>         Wreck Trap <br>         Sea of Silence <br>         Deep Gate<p><br><font color="Thistle'><center> Ecco ina hot tub...uh,tides if time<br><p><p>Crystal Spring's home made rock candy*eao*<br>Fault Zone<br>Two tide's twin gelatin desert*eao*<br>Trellia's Bay<br>Sky Way<br>Sky tides<br>Aqua Tube Way<br>Tube Of Medusa<br>Sky Lands<br>Fin to feather's Chicken and shrimp*eao*<br>Eagle's Bay<br>Asterites Cave<br>Maze of Stone<br>Four Island's 4 layer cake*eao*<br>Sea Of Darkness<br>Vents of Medusa<br>Gate Way<br>Sea Of green's pea soup with hot dog bites*eao*<br>Moray Abyss<br>Sea Of Bird's chicken soup*eao*<br>The Eye's breakfast special *eao*<br>Big Water<br>Deep ridge<br>The hungry one's jumbo meal*eao*<br>Secret Cave<br>Lunar Bay<br>Vortex future <br>Black clouds<br>Gravity Box<br>Globe Holder's meat balls*eao*<br>Convergence <br>Dark Sea<br>New Machine <br>Vortex Queen<br>Epilogue <br>Atlantis<br>Fish city<br>Blackfin's ??<br>Tara's ??<br>Trellia's ??<p><font color="yellow"><center> Wee 'lil Ecco-la....uh....Ecco Jr...that is<br><p><br>Aqua Maze<br>Bay of songs<br>seal rocks<br>Treasure Cave's treasure puffs<br>Sea of Music<br>Ocean Tag<br>The Fish Caves<br>Turtle island's chocolate nut turtles<br>Octopus Passage's "octo" dogs<br>The Enchanted sea's magic salad <br>Mysterious ridge<br>The Lagoon of Stonefish<br>Dolphin ride's gelatin desert<br>Vents of Pearl<br>Sea horse ridge<br>Melodic Waters<br>Meeting Maze<br>The Endless sea<br>Kitnee's  movie snack<p><br><font color="Peachpuff"><center>Ecco the crossing gaurd....um....defender of the future...<br><P><br>Aquamarine bay<br>Perils of the coral reef<br>Trial without error<br>Four ways of mystery's MINI PITZA<br>QURTET <br>Revisited<br>Passage from genesis<br>Pathways from nowhere<br>Up and down<br>Roaring forces<br>Atlantis lost <br>Shrine of controversy<br>Master of forgotten skills<br>Process that never ends<br>Blades in motion<br>Perpetual fluidity<br>Obscure ways to terminus<br>Sleeping forces of <br>Doom's bean burrito <br>Anguish of dearth<br>Entrapment<br>Caverns of hope's <br>Angel food cake<br>Lair of evil<br>Powers of levitation<br>Hanging waters<br>Ice and fire's <br>Baked Alaska(boss)<br>Abyss of inferno(boss)<br>Mutaclone(boss)<br>Chance of reckoning<br>Hatchery's egg salad<br>Seeds of poison<br>Transfiguration<br>Heart of foe<br>the foe's<br>the gaurdiean's<p><p><p><p><br>okies.....now you may have seen some char's name with an ' and nothing else.....well thats a character's dish,  if i left out some porples (porpuis + people) then just add them.....<p>oh boy.....this is a lot of work....<br>

Z||000002||blackfin||09-08-2000||12:47 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Sorry, I can't really help with this eao...  About the only think I can cook is chocolate cake and I don't really see any level with a name that chocolate cake would fit in with...  Unless you want to add blackfin to the charcter list... After all he does appear in ecco2 then I could make it "blackfin's chocolate cake"  which wouldn't be that far off what it really is...  N.B The recipe would be from a cook book, I'm not that much of a cook...
Z||000003||Eao||09-08-2000||07:39 AM||collprin@warwick.net||the deep dip is this 7 layer beam dip my parents like....it has lots of crazy shtuff...<p>*thinks* i thought i addend chocolate cake to 'dark water'<p>i forgot to add blakfin to the char list...hmmmmm....just say which level you want to tackel...
Z||000004||blackfin||09-08-2000||04:27 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||oppsss,  I missed that...  Quite right you did claim chocolate cake...  Hm I'll try thinking up something else then but don't hold your breath, like I said I'm not much of a cook.
Z||000005||Ecco the barbarian||09-08-2000||04:52 PM||barbarian8ieght@hotmail.com||Wait, did she say we take a food and an ecco level and put them together with a recipie, let me try:<p>-Mutaclone Ice cream cone<br>-Hanging Hot dog flavored water<p>I think the mutaclone ice cream sounds better.<p>Hanging hot dog flavored water ingriedients:<p>-Take 1 big pot<br>-fill with warm water<br>-put hotdogs in water<br>-cook at medium of 90 D's and cook for 10 minites.<br>-take hotdogs out and chopo them to dust!<br>-Sprinkle lightly in hotdogwater.<br>-serve and wallah!<p>A tasty treat!

First thing is to layer the bottom of a baking pan (preferably glass) with cream cheese.  then put on some of that cooked, spice meat they used in tacos, add a layer of mexican three-cheese shredded, then a layer of refried beans (I could do without this ingredient---toot!), then another layer of meat, then put a thick layer of that cheese on top.  Bake at 300 degrees until the cheese on top is completely melted and let it cool for a five minutes or so.  Then use those big corn chips and dig in.  Its sooooo good.  I officially named it the "mexican orgasm"
Z||000007||Ecco the barbarian||09-08-2000||06:19 PM||barbarian8ieght@hotmail.com||(Barbars mouth drulls in hunger) I'll keep that in mind! That sounds excellent! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
Z||000008||blackfin||09-09-2000||08:12 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Your recipe sounds nice dragonboy,  I'll have to try it one of these days...
Z||000009||dragonboy||09-09-2000||01:11 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||yes, it is a most excellent treat.  my sister adds salsa  in between one of tthe middle layers, but I don't care much for salsas.
