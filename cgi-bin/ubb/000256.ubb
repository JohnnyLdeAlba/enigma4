A||||12||Miana||A question to my fanfic
Z||000000||Miana||10-20-2000||06:59 PM||trixie2@mindspring.com||How many of you would like to be in it since I'm only doing it for fun? This is just a question to see who would be interested.<p>Miana<br>"Times change, lives change, hell, even my body changes."
Z||000001||dragonboy||10-20-2000||07:05 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||you can put me in it if you wish, although dragonboy doesn't sound like a good dolphin name.  possibly you could make it dragohn.  anyways, just make your mind and pen (or keyboard) become one and let the story unfold as if you lived it.  i love creative writing and this is my technique for composing stories.

Just remember make sure that you mention that I have a star on my head and that I protect the Sacred Coral Reef. I'm sure my bro Buddy would want to be in it too. Do you want to be in mine, Miana?
Z||000003||Crestoe||10-20-2000||08:28 PM||crestoe@arkonviox.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcrestoe.gif">  I'd like to be in it! But, Drawing me is a bitch, serriously. I think you know what i look like. Only i have the helmet on. Im doing the exact same thing in mine, only i didnt ask anyone...but if they dont want me to i wont. I have Barbarian in mine. But he's not like the one we know: He is a creation of Mutaclone, a crossover of man and dolphin that ecco has to fight. And Coral, i have been slowing down on your alien pictures becuz ive been working on the looks for the charicters in my story. I'll be showing those soon! <p>I cant wait to see the front cover you did Miana, i heard what its gonna look like. Cool! That comic's gonna be good<br>
