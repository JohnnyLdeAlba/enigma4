It can screw with your body.  If anyone has never messed with any party drug and wishes to try them, do not go any harder than marijuana.  From personal experience, the addiction, negative symptoms, and overall unpredictability of cocaine, crack, heroin, crystal meth, etc, are just not worth the experience.  I was such a stupid ass for even allowing myself to get caught in those aforementioned substances.  Oh yeah, barbarian, stick to beer, do not drink liquor straight.  I use to think i was da' man, but presently I have a gastric ulcer from too much wild turkey (that's a bourbon-whisky to you who aren't aware).  Ideally, I shouldn't even be drinking beer, but I need some kind of an outlet for my weekend adventures.
