Z||000000||dragonboy||11-27-2000||03:45 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||this is a continuation from another topic (what would your mother think).  Animal cruelty, you have no idea hoe contraversial and debatable this topic is.  most of you know that all the drugs and prescriptive drugs these days are tested on animals (mostly rats and mice) before being introduced to human subjects.  so do you think this is wrong?  after all, some of these drugs saves lives, but during testing phases some animals are given super toxic levels of this drug to see how much will kill, or what effects are brought about.  some medical tests are just pointless.  like one thing my sister had to do in medical school.  in order to measure the efficiency of the hemoglobin (oxygen transporters in blood) in a body system, they had to thrown kittens in a tank and measure how long it took for then to drown.  awful stuff.  or some rats are given cancers to test drugs on to see if they have any effect.  another thing she had to do was take rabbits, slam them against the table then cut them open and try surgical procedures.  this was to give them practice at live surgery (not with cadavers, or dead people as you know them)  any comments on animal testing and cruelty, is it worth it in science?

As for the subject, well, I don't really feel like touching on the depressing issue right now...perhaps later I will. But to answer your very last question, with only 3 words (since I don't want to discuss in detail right now)...yes and no.

Z||000003||Coral||11-27-2000||04:27 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Ok. I'm continuing. <br>Dragonboy, the shelter manager is out now. DING DONG! The witch is dead, as me and my mom say it. And she is a lawyer too! If you laid a finger on her she would take you to court right away and you'd be sent to jail!<br>Although, I'd like to give Andrea (the one that let Chance die) a little surprise. I'd ring her doorbell and say "Would you like some bullets in your head? Their free of charge." pull out a shotgun and blow her frigin' head off!<IMG SRC="devil.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="evil"> I hope she dies and rots in HELL!

Z||000006||Debaser13||11-28-2000||07:28 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||I used to work as a kennel attendant at a vet's office at home, and I saw some things that would break your heart. <p>One thing that stands out in my mind was the mongrel dog whose owners brought it in when it was as close to death as possible. <p>Why had they brought him in? Well,evidentally his collar was so tight it had cut very, </i> very </i> deep into it's neck. Not only that, but the skin had begun to grow back <i> over </i> the filthy inbedded collar. So obviously this had been going on for a long time. <p>When they pulled the collar off the dog's neck, there was the biggest, longest, most disgusting gash I have ever seen. The smell would make you retch, and a couple of people did. I think the humane society got the dog in the end, but I think that's the most blatant from of cruelty I've ever witnessed. Neglect. <p>I saw a lot of other things, but I don't like to think about them. I really wouldn't want to be a vet.<p>And animal research should NOT be allowed, for love or money. You wanna test stuff, test it out on humans; I'm sure there are a few who would be glad to sacrifice themself to the cause of science. But don't pick on creatures who can't speak for themselves.<p>Three very good books about this subject you might want to pick up are <i> Animal Liberation,</i> <i>The Plague Dogs</i>, by Richard Adams,and <i> Dr.Rat.</i> All three are very good books. Check 'em out.
Z||000007||Histronic||11-28-2000||07:56 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Well, I think I've heard the worst story so far....  I read on a news website that someone walked into I think a gas station with a fox, stock a air pump in its rectum and blew it up.<p>I would have been upset if this was most animals, but I love foxes, second to dolphins.  *SIGH*  That wasn't even for a cause of science, just because that guy was riding a pine pony.
Z||000008||Eao||11-28-2000||08:03 AM||collprin@warwick.net||why cats?<p>hmmmmm i'm not sure what to say exactly......people have differnt moral standerds and shit...i my self seem to be on meds alot, but the kitten thing was just wrong.  Because ancient ppl worshiped cats, then the christans came along and now theyr evil...cu of the witches.  tisk tisk and those dumbasses say hipoctits go to hell.  Score one more for my dark/light reversal theroy.  The cat was sneezed outta the lion on the ark.  The cat killed the rat whom was harboring the devil.  So years latter you burn innosent non-christan cats.  This makes a lot of sence...right?<p><br>now...throwing a cat in a microwave has no scientific ourcome......i overherd some kids at school once who nuked their kitty for 20 sec and the laughed at the "silly behavior".  Or the kids who shoved fire crackers up the colaca of a tied up snake and blew it up.<p><br>we could test on dieing ppl or prisonairs......or like hobos////ok now that's mean.....hmmmmm ppl whohave no reason to live.....or convince ppl who are superreligois.<p><br>yeh....weed 'em out if they don't join!<p>thats what they think.<p><br>-Evil Eao

Z||000011||Coral||11-28-2000||03:38 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Well actually Silverfin, I hope that Chance will come back from the dead and haunt her for the rest of her life!<IMG SRC="devil.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="evil"><br>Besides, she let him die and never cared! I want to just wring her neck, throw her dead body in a dumpster and let it rot with maggots eating her flesh! Oh yeah! She makes me so mad! She is such a BITCH!

AAARGH, I'M REALLY SENSITIVE ABOUT CATS, AND I HOPE THAT LIONS, LEAPOARDS, PUMAS, HOUSE CATS, AND ESPECIALLY TIGERS GROW TO DOMINATE THE WORLD, AND THE HUMAN RACE IS ERADICATED!!!  WE'RE JUST GONNA GO THROUGH A JUDGEMENT DAY, WHERE EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE WRONG IS GONNA PAY LIKE HELL!!!  ARRRGGGHHH!!  CATS WILL CONQUER THE WORLD!!!!!  NO MATTER HOW PISSED OFF CORAL GETS!!!!!!!!!!!  MAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After what we do to them....
Z||000018||Coral||11-28-2000||08:02 PM||ntraver@epix.net||I really don't like cats very much. <br>Well, I don't like cats that enjoy scratching me. <br>It upsets me to see animals getting killed in many gruesome ways. Especially ones that you love and care for, like what happened to me. Some humans aren't that bad. Instead of looking at all the bad things, look at some of the good things people have done. Like me and my mom getting the abusive shelter manager out. We saved many cat's and dog's lives. People are fighting to save animals!<br>The thing is that for a punishment for abusing animals is a slap on the wrist and a 1 or $200 fine. I think it should be life in prison cause I consider that murder!
Z||000019||yogoat||11-28-2000||08:23 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||yeah, like I said, arrogant...those s.o.bs, what happened with you and your horse Chance, anyway?

That would save poor Coral the anguish of telling the sad sad story all over again! So, how 'bout it?! Don't make her tell it again...please!
Z||000021||Delphi||11-28-2000||10:50 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Someone nuked their kitten for 20 seconds in a microwave?<p>...<br>...<br>...<br>...<p>WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD IS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD? I MEAN, I HEAR ABOUT KIDS GETTING KILLED IN THEIR SCHOOLS OVER THIRTY GOD DAMN DOLLARS, MASSACRED BECAUSE OF BULLIES, AND ALL THAT, AND I'M SICK OF IT!<p>I watched this talk show once where these kids killed a puppy named Scruffy, and it was disgusting. They stabbed the dog with a pitchfork or rake or something, and they GOD DAMN TAPED IT! THE DOG WAS CUTE AS HELL, AND HE DIDN'T EVER DO A FUCKING THING TO THOSE GOD DAMN SICK MINDED LITTLE ASSHOLES THAT KILLED HIM. Then they threw him in a BAG like a piece of garbage.<p>Know what one of the kids' mothers had to say?<p>"IT'S ONLY A DOG!!"<p>How about "It's only a kid," or "It's only your friend," or something? Is that their EXCUSE for MURDERING a helpless dog? ONLY. You can't say "It was only my child," or "It was only YOUR child," <p>Personally, I think that bitch that let your dog die, Coral, can burn in hell, and those kids who killed Scruffy can burn in hell, and ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO HARM OR KILL ANYTHING ELSE UNDER THE SUN CAN BURN IN HELL!<br>I'm not extremely religious, but I believe that if you want to kill one of God's creation, you can put up with the consequences or just not do it and learn some FUCKING RESPECT FOR THE OTHER ANIMALS AND PEOPLE THAT SHARE THE WORLD WITH YOU.<p><IMG SRC="smilie35.gif" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100 BORDER=0 ALT="dead"><p>*I apologize for any cursing in here, but I'm not taking it out BECAUSE I feel too strongly on the subject to*<br>
