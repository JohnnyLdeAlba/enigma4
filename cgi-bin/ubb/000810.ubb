Z||000000||blackfin||05-19-2001||02:54 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've been reading all the E3 news websites and it seems there is a new Panzer Dragoon game coming to the X-box, I loved those games on the saturn, I'll buy an X-box just for that one game, I can't wait...<p>Oh, I've Seen Sonic advance for the Gameboy Advance as well, it looks just like the old Mega Drive/ Genesis sonic games, I'm tempted to get that as well, I just love the old sonic games....<p>Does anybody else have any games they have seen anounced at E3 they would die for?

The company's first three GameCube offerings include Phantasy Star Online Version 2, Super Monkey Ball and Virtua Striker 3 Version 2002. <p>"We will be a major player on GameCube," said Charles Bellfield, Sega's vice president of marketing and corporate affairs, in an IGN conference call. "We have a relationship with Nintendo to deliver online content through GameCube with Phantasy Star Online as the first example. We'll be looking to extend our expertise with Nintendo GameCube in the online world." <p>Furthermore, the company will bring its acclaimed sports games to Nintendo's next-generation console as well, though no details have been made official yet. "We will continue to invest in what we refer to as 'all sports, all platforms' with our strategy," said Bellfield. "We enjoy the challenge of going against our competitors specifically in the sports arena. And we enjoy going against all other publishers in a sports arena on all platforms. We believe the games that we'll be delivering here will far exceed those of our competitors." <p>Bellfield also commented that that Sega may indeed show some of the still-secret other GameCube projects at its booth beginning on Thursday. <p>See related stories for details on specific Sega GameCube titles in the works. <p>More as it develops. <p><p><br>^_^ Thats all from me for now, i'll keep you informed.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Whitefin Dolphinius<br>The Black Dolphin with a heart of gold.<br>http://born.as/biohazardous<br>

Z||000004||GTK||05-19-2001||02:34 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Panzer Dragoon Wai! ^__^ Actually, I didn't know there'd be a PD game coming out for the X-thinggit (yecch) but if there is, I may actually break the Microsoft-hating habit of a lifetime and buy one. <p>But I think the one I'll be waiting for will be the Sonic game. I'll definitely pick up anything out on GBA, because I'm such a strong Sonic fan, but... eh... every Sega system I ever bought, I bought for the Sonic game. I don't suppose it'll be any different now Sega are third-party only. <p>I just wish there was a Sonic version of Super Smash Bros. ^_^

Z||000006||blackfin||05-19-2001||06:15 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Yup there has been a big movie of it shown i believe head over to www.ign.com and read the news, there is much too much to say here.<p>I forgot Riveler you are right there are rumours about a new nights game, I'd be after that as well, and I can't wait to what platform ecco2 is announced for.  I'm hoping that since I'm getting an X-box for panzer dragoon that Nights2 and Ecco2 will be on the X-box as well, I don't fancy having to buy an X-box for Panzer Dragoon, a Game Cube for Ecco2 and a PS2 for Nights2 or something, I don't even want to think how much it would cost....<p>Hey now that Sega is developing for the Game Boy Advance, what would you think if Sega either ported over the old Mega Drive/Genesis ecco games to it with a few enhancements or even made a totally new game...  Would that be kewl or what...  *crosses fingers*
Z||000007||blackfin||05-19-2001||06:51 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Oh and here is all I've found on the new panzer dragoon game so far;<p> <IMG SRC="http://xboxmedia.ign.com/media/features/previewguide/panzer.jpg"> <p> <A HREF="http://xbox.ign.com/news/33047.html" TARGET=_blank>http://xbox.ign.com/news/33047.html</A> 
Z||000008||Riveler||05-19-2001||11:27 PM||riveler@uol.com.br||Mega Drive games in a GBA?? If this happens, I'll surely buy one of it. At this moment the GBA has nothing atractive to me except Sonic, a bee game and Klonoa so I don't think I'll buy one at the launch day. <p>I hope the new Ecco game comes to X-box too because I won't buy a PS2 (even) for this game. Sony pruducts are not durable.<p>ARGH! I did it again (2 same posts)! Forgive me <IMG SRC="smilie12.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="worried">

Z||000010||blackfin||05-20-2001||05:17 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I take it you haven't read the nes page Vortex, it looks like ecco2 won't be on dreamcast, but we don't know what console it will be for yet, I totally forgot about SA2, I'll probally get that as well, but I'll get the orginal before that probally or it will spoil the orginal sonic adventure if I play it after the sequel.

SONIC ADVENTURE 2! And after playing the demo, seeing over 100 screenshots, 5 vids, and with the aid of some friends translating the Sonic Team Website to discover a great deal of the actual plot of the game (Japanese to English... if you think Zero Wing's bad, try making sense of what we went through!)<p>I think, since it's released on my Birthday (June 23rd, aka the 10th Anniversery of Sonic and my 16th Bday), I might just maybe could possibly actually be going to perhaps might get it <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>Ecco2, I haven't heard any news of it at E3, but Jet Set Radio Future looks cool, <p><br>Oh, and back to what Blackfin said, don't worry... from what I can tell from the plot of SA2, it's got very little to do with SA1... But then you know what Sonic Team are like,<p>I'm just glad Tails is playable, albeit in a massive great mech...
Z||000012||yogoat||05-20-2001||12:15 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||Wow, so many games, so little money....They all seem sweet!  I'd say the game I'm looking forward to most is MGS2.  Anyone who's played Metal Gear Solid knows that the game kicked  ***  just think what MGS2 is gonna be like!  By the way, is Sonic 2 gonna be coming out for the Dreamcast?
Z||000013||Trace Kyshad||05-20-2001||04:55 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||The following Sequals are confirmed for the DC<p>- Sonic ADventure 2 (*Dribble*)<br>- Shenmue II (*Drool*)<br>- Crazy Taxi 2 (Still gotta play the first!)<br>- Jet Set Radio 2 (Looks sweet)<br>- Toe Jam and Earl 3 (I've seen the vid, new character's there)<br>- Space Channel 5 2... err.. whatever it's gonna be called<br>
Z||000014||blackfin||05-21-2001||06:47 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well it doesn't really matter if there would be a problem with Sonic or not if I played Sonic Adventure first as I've just found a place I can get it cheap and Daytona 2001, I love Daytona......  ^__^  Di Da Du Da De DAAAYYYYYTTTONNNAAAAAAAAA *runs from peole throwing shoes at him* ok, ok I'll be quiet.
Z||000015||Debaser13||05-21-2001||07:27 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Well, E3 is over....and I really didn't see anything all that interesting. It was all about the consoles this year, methinks; GameCube is gonna beat the X-Box like a red-headed stepchild. <p>It weirds me out to see Sega and Nintendo working together. It's like, "No. This should not be." It's GOOD, but it feels wrong. <p>Eh, ahh well. I want a PS2 anyways. It's the only system with any good RPGs forecast.....
Z||000016||Trace Kyshad||05-21-2001||07:51 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Bah, Square are the only peeps who know how to make a good RPG, and they went with Sony...<p>Ah well, so much for the days of Sonic vs Mario, such was the fun in competitive mascots, until Sony turned up and spoiled the fun. But seeing Sega games on a Nintendo console just goes to show how much has changed,<p>Heck, I know a few PS2 owners who would die for a shot of Shenmue, Jet Set Radio, and Sonic Adventure, which just goes to show Sega ain't bad at games, they're just bad at consoles...
Z||000017||Debaser13||05-21-2001||08:16 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||I hate to disagree, but you are very, very wrong about Square being the only good RPG makers. Ever played Valkyrie Profile? The Star Ocean series? The Phantasy Star series? <p>And the most important one of all, Skies of Arcadia. My GOD that game is good, and for the Dreamcast, no less. Grndia II isn't bad itself.<p>Square may have the monopoly on RPGs, but while I love and enjoy the games they make as much as anyone, there ARE other companies, you know. SOA proved that to me.
Z||000018||blackfin||05-23-2001||04:19 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Just be happy that you have time to play RPGs, when I get Sonic Adventure I don't even know when I'll find time to play that...
Z||000019||GTK||05-23-2001||04:50 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Personally I didn't like Shenmue. It was probably something to do with the fact that I was no good at it. I hate games I'm no good at ^_^ (I identify so strongly with game characters that I tend to run away and not let them get hurt, which stopped me getting past the second day in Shenmue). <p>But the best/most immersive RPGs I've played have been the Dragon Warrior series, which are all Enix. And Nintendo. *watches Sega fans head his way with sharpened stakes* Uhh... mind you, I loved NiGHTS. Wait, that wasn't an RPG... okay, this post has gone completely off-topic. I'll finish with my stock observation about Sega and Nintendo: <p>Sega do great storylines (Sonic Adventure, Shenmue, PSU, Skies of Arcadia) but they tend to fall down on mechanics. *fed up with fighting with the camera in SA and finding invisible holes in Ecco* <p>Nintendo's game design is perfect *has yet to find a single bad glitch in the gigantic Zelda 64 games* but they fall down on storylines. The Zelda storyline has holes in it bigger than a Sonic Adventure level. 
Z||000020||Trace Kyshad||05-23-2001||05:19 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||You want plot holes?<p>Final Fantasy VIII!<p>It didn't really have plot holes, just... lost the plot... with regular intervals, and just got... wierd<p>The moment I can actually find Skies of Arcadia, which I agree looks exceptionally kickass (And I can't for the life of me find it in this Godforsaken country that is Scotland, but then I'm not looking for it, I'll wait until June 23rd...), then I'll be happy<p>Actually, come June 23rd, I'll have many reasons to be happy
Z||000021||GTK||05-23-2001||05:32 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Don't diss FFVIII! My little brother likes it ^^; Actually, the only Final Fantasy game I've played is VII, and then only for long enough to understand the fanfiction ^^; 
Z||000022||blackfin||05-23-2001||05:42 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've only playd FF3/6 and I loved it, but it took wayyyyy too long to do, I can't afford to get messed up with an RPG again, if I did.... You'd lose me for months...  
Z||000023||Debaser13||05-23-2001||06:53 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Skies of Arcadia.....it's already out here, Trace, but I had a hard time finding it...check your local HMV, if you've got one nearby. It's worth a search, trust me.
