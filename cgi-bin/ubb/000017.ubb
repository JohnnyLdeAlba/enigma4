Anyway go see the walkthrought for Ecco the Dolphin for dreamcast for more details

Z||000005||Alpha||09-02-2000||11:06 AM||andkruse@gateway.net||It is the best level in the entire game, oh by the way on tim follin's website(sorry I don't remember the address) he mentioned that he was working on music for a sequel to DOTF. It better have a level like hanging waters. Or else.
