I downloaded it but it requires a new version of shockwave flash to work. I got 2 different versions yesterday and the game doesn´t work. Just tell me: it´s a good game?

I've had trouble with it myself, it will only even work on one of my computers, I've never had any luck in try to get it to work on of my other computers.  The game is alright but I don't think it you should be that concered if you can't play it.  You would probally get tired of playing it quite fast.
