Z||000004||Histronic||12-15-2000||08:19 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard.gif">Not crayon, colored pencil.  I've been after Crestoe to tell me how he colors those things, but he hasn't told me as of yet.  I think I'll use them equally.

Z||000006||Histronic||12-16-2000||04:09 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard.gif"> Adobe Photoshop???  *Slaps himself*  There it's been, collecting dust, when I could have been the coloring king!  That also explains why his GIFs aren't dithered.
