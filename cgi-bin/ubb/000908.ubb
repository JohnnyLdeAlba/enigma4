Z||000000||HazardousRaptor||06-21-2001||01:22 AM||hedgehog@nb.net||Just got Sonic Adventure 2 today!  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="smilie6.gif" HEIGHT=90 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="bouncing"> <p>Great game,simply put. <p>Which gets me thinking,what would the next Ecco game be like?<p>Here is my idea of the idle Ecco game,in a little segment I'd like to call "Lets pretend!" (Lets pretend theme music plays)<p>TITLE: NOT Ecco 2! Remember this is the FORTH in a series,and none of them have a number. So that tradition should be carried on. I'm thinking something like.... Ecco: Warrior of the Seas.<p>SYSTEM: A tough one,considering that my favorite system of all time,the Dreamcast,is about dead.  <IMG SRC="smilie13.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="crying">  Personally,I would like Ecco to come to the X-box. But any system is fine with me.<p>PLOT: Enough with time travel!I like time travel,but for the love of Earth,enough! <br>No,we need something differant,something fresh. We can have the Vortex/Foe locked in a war over Earth,and Ecco is caught in the middle of it. He is getting requests by both the Foe and Vortex to "join their side". In the midst of this,another force on Earth is taking advantage of the distraction to.......<p>You'll just have to find out.  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> <p>NEW  **** : Definally some new moves,you know,powers 'n  **** .  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">  Like the ability to temporairally fly, to summon a shark or other animal to attack a enemy. Also,I'd like to change into more creatures,like sharks,Orcas,ect,and for a longer period of time. Woulden't it be awesome to change into a wolf,or something,and go though a level -on land-!  <IMG SRC="eek.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="surprised">  <p>And another thing,I'd like to talk to sentiant sharks,and have sharks help me. Like Great whites and Makos,they are very intelligent,afterall.<p>FEATURES: I would really like a mini-game,like in Sonic Adventure. You could have a little nursury,where you can take care of baby Dolphins,whales,maybe even Sharks! Hell,Ecco Jr could be there!  <IMG SRC="laugh.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh">  In fact,there's another cool idea,Ecco could be a father in the next game. Ecco Jr could trail by your side like a side kick. He can't get hurt,but he could help you out,give you tips,etc.<p>INTERNET: You could download new levels,and put your little baby Dolphins on the net for everyone to play with.<p>VMU: Put your little buddies from the nursary on here,and take care of them on the run.And there could be an assortment of minigames on your VMU as well,like Ecco racing and playing games with other Dolphins.<p>EXTRAS: When playing Ecco DOTF,I loved jumping and tail walking. And I wished I could have a level where I could just,well,play!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">  They could have waterfalls,a beutiful sky (Which,thoughout the day,the sun changes position,and even has a beutiful sunset at the end of the day. And a nighttime as well!) your pod could be there,and have good AI,you could talk to them,and they answear intelligently. (Example: Ecco: Do you like cheese? Other Dolphin : What is cheese?) You could perdorm stunts,jumps,and fly around the bay and above the island.Also,you can change into a whale or shark and swim around as well.<p>Lots of shee-ot to explore,hard to explain,but would it ever rule. <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> You could get access to it when you win the game. You would also be able to invite multi-player friends over to your bay. You could design your own character,even design your own bay!<p>Well,that's my two cents,what do you think?  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> <p>HazardousRaptor....Stays up way to late....<p>"That which does not kill me had better be able to run away  ****  fast."<p>"Raptor.<br> You run with the wind.<br> Raptor.<br> You strike unseen.<br> Raptor.<br> You keep the balance.<br> Raptor.<br> Truth, you have sought.<br> Raptor.<br> Goddess of the hunt.<br> Raptor.<br> Protect thy young with your own precious life.<br> Raptor.<br> Darter through the clustered trees.<br> Raptor.<br> Wolfine in all habits and appearance.<br> Raptor.<br> You are wise.<br> Raptor.<br> You stay with your pack.<br> Raptor.<br> So much we do not know.<br> Raptor.<br> Let us not know...Together.<br> Raptor....<br> Will you run with me?"<p>- A folklore chant/song on Moubius (My fantasy world) where raptors are worshipped,and sentient.<br>
Z||000001||Whitefin Dolphinius||06-21-2001||04:10 AM||loutus_leopard@hotmail.com||that-sounds-AWESOME!!!!!! *hugs HR* ^_^<br>It should also include Dolphins of the past *not leading to Whitefin in anyway, but* It'd be really cool to have the forces from the past fight with Ecco and such. We're seen too many future Dolphins and stuff, givme that pasties <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge">
Z||000002||blackfin||06-21-2001||07:54 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Those are very good ideas, I'm highly hopeful that some of them may be a reality in ecco2, at any rate I know it will be much much better than dof.
Z||000003||yogoat||06-21-2001||12:50 PM||||Hmm, it'd certainly be cool if you could play with your buddies over the internet...but for that, you'd need at least a broadband connection...WHICH I HAVE!!  Speaking of the sky-thing, didn't Anguish of Death's sky change colors?  But HR, you really do stay up too late..awesome ideas, though!
Z||000004||GTK||06-21-2001||01:17 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Do you mean dynamically changing colors, or just, uh, statically as in a variegated band of colors on the texture? *confused* I remember spending a long time staring up at the sky in AoD, but I don't remember why now... maybe I'd been on the LSD again (see below). 
Z||000005||PsySonic||06-21-2001||01:49 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||Heheh, nice ideas there...<p>But I'd prefer the time travel thing, though. They are so typical for Ecco, they shouldn't be removed.<p>I'd love to see definately something different than the fow, but I guess, though, that the sequel will "only" have the foe to return and mix up things again... How cool would it be to swim through the Asterite in 3D, but, bah, the sequel will probably continue on DOTF. Not that DOTF is bad, but you have to admit that the first games in 3D would've been a lot cooler <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <i>*thinks of a 3D Atlantis...*</i><p>Oh well, so we have to get along with Guardian and foe...<p>I'd love to see David Brin as the script and story writer, from the onbeginning! Not just as a game connector like in DOTF. I guess he could do so many cool things, he would have many interesting ideas on that for sure! If you read his books you know what I'm talking about.
Z||000006||DolphinJoy||06-21-2001||05:19 PM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||Kool ideas!<p>I'd like to see Ecco talking to seals..that's one thing we've never had.  And although we've had Atlantis THREE times, we've never had a shipwrek level, or any other ruins.  I'd also like to see Ecco travelling into more areas with waterfalls... how about an amazon river-type level with waterfalls and loads of greenery?  That'd be pretty <IMG SRC="eek.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="surprised"> 
Z||000007||Histronic||06-21-2001||09:58 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Heh, what would really rock would be a stunt mode like in Rush 2049.... if you do different kinds of flips you get points for it, and then extra points for combos.  It would be timed, and at the end, you would see how many points you have!<p>As for the plot, I would liek to see ecco get up close and personal witht he foe, actually go on their ship and blow it up!  <IMG SRC="devil.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="evil"> 
Z||000008||dolphingirl||06-22-2001||05:50 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Hazardous...you just plain out-did yourself with all those awesome ideas there... <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ...sounds like it'd be a really cool game! All the ideas mentioned here were cool...<i>*sees everyone get snatched up by men wearing T-shirts with the name "Appaloosa" on them*</i>... <IMG SRC="laugh.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh">

Z||000011||K||06-22-2001||09:34 PM||kschnee@mit.edu||Yeah, shipwreck and Amazon levels would be great, as would having Brin write the story again. I'd like to see land and air-based shapeshifting next time, too.<p>I'd definitely like to see something other than the Foe as the villain for once. The Zelda series finally broke out of its Link vs. Ganon rut in "Majora's Mask," and the series was better for it.<p>Since we've had time travel over and over, how about space travel? There's some precedent for it. With Ecco getting warped through space, you could justify having a lava world and other exotic settings. (Hmm... inside a space station?) It ties in with the future theme.<p>If there's going to be time travel, I want to see a non-linear approach with several alternate futures at once. There wouldn't be just one "good" future, but several with various ups and downs, and you'd have to keep switching between them.
Z||000012||HazardousRaptor||06-23-2001||12:24 AM||hedgehog@nb.net||Wow! Thanks alot everybody,you all have great ideas. You made me feel so special.  <IMG SRC="smilie44.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rolling"> <p>Whitefin,thank you,and yes,a good idea! Travling into the past to meet some past dolphins would be intresting.Esspecially if we were to meet Ecco's ancestors.Which brings up a intresting side plot,what if the Foe tried to go back in time and try to kill Ecco's ancestors,thereby,no Ecco in the future. <p>Blackfin,thanks! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <p>Yogoat,thanks!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <p>Psysonic,you have a good point. But only a roamp in the past like in the first game would seem fresh at this point.<p>Dolphinjoy,another great idea!  <IMG SRC="smilie46.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="idea">  It would be very cool,and new,to have a Amazon river level.<p>Histronic,a cool idea,I like it. <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>Dolphingirl,thanks!  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">   <IMG SRC="laugh.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh"> <p>HazardousRaptor....Spelled "ideal" wrong,oops.  <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="roll eyes"> <p> "That which does not kill me had better be able to run away  ****  fast."<p>"Raptor.<br> You run with the wind.<br> Raptor.<br> You strike unseen.<br> Raptor.<br> You keep the balance.<br> Raptor.<br> Truth, you have sought.<br> Raptor.<br> Goddess of the hunt.<br> Raptor.<br> Protect thy young with your own precious life.<br> Raptor.<br> Darter through the clustered trees.<br> Raptor.<br> Wolfine in all habits and appearance.<br> Raptor.<br> You are wise.<br> Raptor.<br> You stay with your pack.<br> Raptor.<br> So much we do not know.<br> Raptor.<br> Let us not know...Together.<br> Raptor....<br> Will you run with me?"<p>- A folklore chant/song on Moubius (My fantasy world) where raptors are worshipped,and sentient.<p><p>

Ecco could travel to the past and meet his ancestors, encounter the Vortex Queen *she's there, if you remember the end of ToT* And the Foe find a way to get to the past and try killin the past Dolphins! This sound so cool!!!!!! <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"><p>Hell, if we can't make it a game, why not a big online FanFic, where people reply and add parts to the story.<br>I've see this work on REO boards, and It could work here too ^_^
Z||000014||Whitefin Dolphinius||06-23-2001||12:43 AM||loutus_leopard@hotmail.com||Gomen Ne, I meant HR, not HD.
Z||000015||DolphinJoy||06-23-2001||05:28 AM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||Brilliant idea Whitefin!<p>I also like the idea of land-based shape-shifting...Ecco could even transform into one of his land-based ancestors that we were discussing in another topic.<p>I don't think i'd really like Brin to write the plot...I've read one of his books, and i didn't really like it...bit disappointing  <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">   I also thought that the plot of Ecco<IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">otF  wasn't all that great...it was just too hard to follow, IMHO.  I much prefered the plot of Ecco:ToT, which was easy to follow but really imaginative at the same time.<p>I'd also like to see a bit more fantasy in Ecco (people may well disagree).  It could have Sea Serpents and magical creatures..after all, how do we know they don't exist??? There's more sightings of Sea Serpents than Beaked Whales!
Z||000016||blackfin||06-23-2001||08:07 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I don't really like the idea of adding magic and such to ecco personally.  I just don't personally think it will fit in too well with the existing style, I like ecco how it is, I don't want to change it really....
Z||000017||Trellius||06-25-2001||06:20 PM||thedolphin@ananzi.co.za|| Hmm. Well reflecting on the toppic: The ideal Ecco game is....one that never ends!<IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"> 
Z||000018||dolphingirl||06-25-2001||11:56 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Heheh...yup, I second that! <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000019||BlackDragon||06-26-2001||07:04 AM||blackfox71@yahoo.com||How about an Ecco game where you can play as other dolphins in side stories? Or costomize your dolphin character to look unique like in Phantasy Star Online. Or download new skins? Just an idea....
Z||000020||blackfin||06-26-2001||07:33 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||That would be kewl as well but if Appaloosa did program all this it would probally add an extra year to the development time... so that begs the question if you had the chance to make that decision would you rather wait an extra year for lots of kewl stuff or have an ecco gam right now but now with so much stuff?  I'm not really sure what I'd prefer, both ideas sound tempting, but we won't find what choice Appaloosa have made untill we see the next ecco game...
Z||000021||DolphinJoy||06-26-2001||08:05 AM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||Kool.  I'd love to play as Trellia..could fly all over the place..weeeeeeeeeeeee! : starts circling about, flippers out stretched:
Z||000022||K||06-26-2001||04:27 PM||kschnee@mit.edu||I prefer the light sci-fi theme of DOtF to the fantasy style of the others, and I wouldn't want to see the series fill up with spells and Loch Ness Monsters etc. And isn't the idea of a future world building its own Atlantis more interesting than Plato's old fantasy version of it?<p>As for DJ's comment: "How do we know they don't exist?" We can't prove that invisible unicorns exist, but that doesn't make them real either. If you're just talking about fantasy, never mind -- it's just that some people think that way about reality.<p>:thinks about invisible unicorns in the next Ecco...:
Z||000023||DolphinJoy||06-26-2001||05:05 PM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||I thought there would be violent objections to that suggestion! Much of Ecco is quite fantasy as it is...the whole thing with Trellia, Atlantis (Ecco 1 and 2) and the Asterite is very mysterious and magical, which i like.  I thought the plot of Ecco<IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">otF lost a lot of this quality, and felt a little cliche. 
Z||000024||blackfin||06-27-2001||07:18 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Perhaps but there is some scientific explation behind most things, there is no outright 'magic' in my opinion. For example I seem to remeber a glyph in one the levels in ToT telling you about the future dolphin's having Helium in their bodies....
Z||000025||Histronic||06-27-2001||11:18 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Yeah, stealing humility, compassion, and such, things don't even physically exist is kind of dumb.  Even worse because the foe only took it from a few dolphins.  But I loved the idea of the clan and the resistance and the rest of the Brin plotline.  I can't wait for Arkon to finish his game so we can have some closure on the original Ecco series, though.  WHY OH WHY did appaloosa switch stories in midstream?
Z||000026||blackfin||06-28-2001||08:18 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well provided I get my game done you'll get to see my storyline whhich links the two games has what I think is a plausable explanation for how the fow could steal globes of things like compassion, but considering I'm up past midnight with just running this website I don't see myself working on my game much soon... <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">
Z||000027||Histronic||06-28-2001||11:01 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||How about you just give up on the site until you can get a beta of your game out and then just go back to doing both?
