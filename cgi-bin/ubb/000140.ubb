To do this trick charge at the surface while holding the joystick down and press A and B together while flipping backwards. I often jump around for hours. I do that so much that it makes me and brother dizzy!

Charge up out of the water and hold down B+down+R trigger or L trigger, but not both. Ta-Da! The Diagonal Twist-Spin! Idinit' great? I also like the Dolphin Groove. Hold down Y and press left and right on the analog pad over and over just quickly enough that he shakes his head and tail back and forth. The Dolphin Groove! I like the tailwalk and the dolphin chatter.<p>"Do the Tailwalk, Tailwalk, Tailwalk!"-Second 'Player', Aquamarine Bay
