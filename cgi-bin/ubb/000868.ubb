I'm afraid that I cannot do one for you because the program I used to make mine is Kaput! right now. So, sorry.<p> <IMG SRC="smilie5.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="slit eyes">

Upon entering their forum, you'll see that there are 3 seperate ones, one of which is "1-900-Crestoe". Crestoe is the guy that draws most face pics you see here, he's really awesome, and is usually happy to do one for someone. Ask him there, or here, as he might see it here too. Or, just ask around...I'm sure you'll find someone! Just don't count on having one in the snap of a finger, as they'll need time to draw it. Mine was done by Reptyx. Others here do them as well. Just nicely ask around.
