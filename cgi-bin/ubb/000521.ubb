Well, I don't really get into a Christmas mood at all, only when I play Xmas-Lemmings <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><p>(especially when I think about having to work tomorrow from 9am till 6pm in a totally crowded supermarket, getting stressed at the cash desk only because of people being stupid enough to buy their stuff one day before christmas. Yeah, I like my job ^_^)

One year he tore down the star in the top of the tree and placed himself there! But the last couple of years he's become so big and heavy that the branches bend under him... <br>I wanted to give him a rubber duck for X-mas because he doesn't like bathing very much so I hoped it'd cheer him up... well I don't belive too much that it will but I don't want to give him a plastic plant again like I did last year and the year before that because he doesn't like them anymore when he figures out that he can't eat 'em. Anyway, the rubber ducks were sold out, so I bought him a plastic orca instead. ^_^<br>

I hung a green sparkly festoon outside his window, but he doesn't seem to care about it much. His window really needs cleaning, he's sneezed all over it as usually, but maybe I should leave it, the encrusted snot makes such lovely fake snow... Disgusting? Four years with Spiky have made me used to it... ^^;
