That's where I went, and they've got a big selection on emulators, and rom's! Check it out. I hope that's what you were looking for...or perhaps you've been there already...?!? Try it if you haven't! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

I don't know for sure what a "system rom" is, but i'm sure you could read about it, or someone here should know...

I think what the emulator wants is the BIOS of the system you are emulating (the basic program that is in every one of the consoles that allows the games to interact with console), but as to where you could find one...  Well I'm not sure, you'll just have to search for it.
