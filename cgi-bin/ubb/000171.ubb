Of Yangtze River dolphins, there are only five in known existence and one of these is in captivity.  The humans can be blamed for this, as well as the shrinking numbers of river dolphins all over.  Marine dolphins are overkilled, but the river dolphins may be extinct soon.

Thier homes are blocked by dams, polluted by factories, and the towns just dump thier crap in the water.<br>Most of them are shot just for fun! I'm telling ya, people are such #@%$*@#$%^&*!!!<br>Excuse my French!!!

At one time I believe it was the Arabian Oryx was down to only 9 left in existence, but they were rescued and have grown considerably in numbers. If action is taken immeadiately this river dolphin species may be saved, but they've got to get going NOW!
