What gives? So here's what we've all gotta do : Go to fanfiction.net and e-mail the girl in charge about getting an Ecco section put up. If enough of us beg and plead I'm sure one will pop up. I've already e-mailed to get the ball rolling, but only one person won't work. So let's get those e-mails in.
