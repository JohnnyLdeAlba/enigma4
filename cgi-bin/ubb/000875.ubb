This is "Out Of the Blue," not directly Ecco-related but obviously relevant. It's around one-third done.<p>It's at <http://web.mit.edu/kschnee/www/BlueExcerpt.rtf>, if anyone would like to see it and help out. Tell me if you can't read RTFs.<p>And if anyone else needs help with fiction they're working on, ask.

Only thing, it took me a minute or two to figure out what was going on and who Huck and Selene were, but after that, it really was great! I like the conversations that take place between the 'fins, and the humans. <br>The characters are well set up, I think.<p>Overall, nice work, keep it up, great looking, don't stop now, and I am sorry, but since I am not the best story writer, I am rather devoid of ideas at the moment, but if any manage to break into my skull, I will tell you.  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
