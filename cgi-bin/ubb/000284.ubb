Someone to help! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> Hey, that's pretty awsome you've got all of 'em but one! And I'm totally with you on the 'strategy guides being too vague'!!! Hanging Waters was one of the hardest levels to find them all on (not to mention it was just plain hard to get to the end)! But to make it easier, maybe you could let me know which ones you <i>have</i> found...so, hope to hear from you real soon!
Z||000001||dolphingirl||10-26-2000||08:05 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Hey.....ya out there? I'd love to help you out on the vitalit thing, so let me know where all you've found one in the Hanging Waters level! k....<IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"><br>
Z||000002||That guy with the hat||10-26-2000||08:31 PM||||Ho boy lets see if I remember...hmm...<p>I got the one in the top of the mountain just before Mutaclone.<p>I got the one in the higher path leading out of one of the hollow rocks.<p>I got one where you leave abyss of inferno and then you swim into the cave and there's one near the bottom behind the rock.<p>I'm afraid its been so long that I don't quite remember where that other one I got was(or maybe I have a lazy brain).
Z||000003||dolphingirl||10-26-2000||09:15 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||OK! Yeah...understand...it's been a while for me too since I last played that level...so I'l try to remember them all...<IMG SRC="smilie46.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="idea"><p>Hope these help & I'm not repeating what you've found...sorry if that becomes the case.<p>1. Yeah! If you're using a strategie guide to find this one...chances are that it'll take you right by it...! When you first enter the first stage of Hanging Waters it will automatically move you through this tube, and stop you before the first Jelly Wall. <i>Don't</i> touch any of the controlls until you come to a stop. Then turn ecco to the right till you're aiming dead center for the water bubble. (See, strategie guides will tell you to just ignore the bubble since it only contains a Help Glyph! <IMG SRC="smilie4.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="very mad"> Not true!!!) The vitalit is in the center of the bubble, near the floor, inside a plant!<p>2. I believe you found this one...in the top tube on your way out of a floating rock.<p>3. :uhou2: <p>4. <IMG SRC="smilie49.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="uhoh"> <p>5. <IMG SRC="smilie49.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="uhoh"><p>6. Number 6, 7, and 8 are in each of the boss levels. This one, in Fire and Ice, is at the very top where there's a water level to poke your head out to fill up on air. Be very careful though, because if you jump out you'll probably die...<IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"><p>7. This one, in Abyss of Inferno, is down near the very bottom. You need to swim all the way down, and along the outside edge is a little ledge. Go just underneath that, and swim in a circle around the whole pool till you come across it.<p>8. You've probably found this one since it's in the area you need to be in in order to pass the level. It's inside the big rock you break open, that when going through it, your sense of direction is all messed up.<p>***Tell ya what, I'm going to go to that level right this instant and figure out where I found 3, 4, and 5! Then I'll be back to fill 'em in since I can't quite remember right now! Okee-dokee.....! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
Z||000004||dolphingirl||10-26-2000||11:32 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Allrighty Then....I've just played through the <i>whole frickin'</i> level, including the boss levels, and I think I remember now...<p><IMG SRC="smilie46.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="idea"><br>3. Ya know the pool underneath the way to get to Abyss of Inferno, well there's a tunnel/cave that leads to another little area. Take that path (same one you'ld take after clearing Abyss of Inferno) and the vitalit is behind the big rock mass (with a green tube coming out, and leading to the ground).<p>4. After beating Abyss of Inferno, and going through the cave to jump over the rocks atop, you land in a fairly small area with tubes goin' every which way! Before jumping into the bubble to continue, look near the floor...it's between a fairly large rock and the wall.<p>5. I think you already got this one, but I'll explain anyway...it's just out of the pool that the huge bird drops you off in, that's just before Mutaclone. Specifically...can't quite remember (maybe behind a rock formation). But if I remember correctly, it's fairly easy to find!<p>So...there you go! I sure hope it helped you to find the one you're missing!!! Please let me know...k!!! <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"><p>BTW...thanks for the challenge of going through the level again to remember where I'd gotten all the vitalits! That level is sooooo awsome!!! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
Z||000005||Trace Kyshad||10-27-2000||12:53 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||ARRGG!! All these cool sounding levels, and where am I? "Process that never stinkin' ends!"<p>Ah well, it's only a week since I got it, and here comes the weekend, hello Vitalis, goodbye bad future etc etc
Z||000006||dolphingirl||10-27-2000||06:52 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Trace.....don't even sweat it! Take your time through the game, and I promise the wait will be more than worth it! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
Z||000007||That guy with the hat||10-28-2000||03:30 PM||||Oh! Thank you Thank you Thank you! I bet the one I missed is the one right at the very beginning! See my strategy guide says to look for it near "the first puzzle near a plant", but when they said puzzle, I figured they meant the rising bubble thing. But then when I gave up on that, I thought maybe it was yet another misprint in their guide and thought maybe they meant near a boss entrance. AAAAGH! Why did I waste my money on this guide?! Oh yeah, because I wanted to find that Dolphin Soccer thing(which turned out to be REALLY lame). It did help me find some vitalits, but not many.
Z||000008||dolphingirl||10-29-2000||01:58 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Awsome!!! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  I'm sooo glad I could help you! So, does this mean that you've got 100% of the vitalits? If so...doesn't it feel great that not a one is left out there hiding!?!
