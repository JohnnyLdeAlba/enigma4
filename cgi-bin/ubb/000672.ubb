I would suggest you position ecco to the side of the glyph just so your nose is touching it and hit it with your sonar, wait untill the glyph has moved away, back towards and then past you to behind you, hit it again is it moves from your tail towards it's starting position, keep repeating this right and the glyph will speed up and eventually break free and fall...

Just go to a glyph, hit it with yer sonar, wait 'till it comes back to your nose, hit it again, and repeat that process until it falls off, whereupon you follow it to the bottom and mave it with your sonar to the glyph the dolphin at the top brings you to. When it starts circling with the other glyph, go and take another, bring it down, and take the last one down.  Then use the sonar or touch the glyph or both (I don't quite remember which,) and when it makes a tone and transfers some circles to you, swim over to the rocks at the lower right of the level and use yer sonar on them.  They'll rumble and fall down after hitting them with sonar for a while. Then, just swim past where they were to the exit.<p>Glad to help, Sepher!  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
