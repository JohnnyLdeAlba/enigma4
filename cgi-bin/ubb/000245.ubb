In Ecco One, you have to go steal a globe from the Asterite in the past to give to the Asterite in the present.  But, if Ecco hadn't stolen the globe at all, he wouldn't have to in the first place, etc.<p>Can anyone explain this?

If one views all the posssible outcomes for every decision/action that has been or will be made, it is logical to assume that there are an infinite amount of realities and timelines to fit those realities that may or may not coincide with other alternate realities.  I know, its hard to explain, lets say that adolf hitler's mom drank a lot of liqour whwn she was pregnant.  She then gave birth to the totalitarian leader of nazism we all know of today.  but what if she smoked a lot of cigareetes instead, causing a stillbirth. Hence, no Hitler would have been born and no world wars would have been caused, at least not the second one.  On the other hand, what if she consumed no substances and she gave birth to a smarter, more diabolical person who successfully implemented his plans of a world under his ideal?  and in effect the mothers use or non-use was caused by an abusive father she hadc as she was growing up, you understand, the laws of cause and effect.  Now what if there was a version of reality created by EVERY diferent combinations of these cause and effect realities, and that there is an infinite number of potential realities all existing alomg the same timeline, with each new reality forming a separate branch.  It is quite possible that a time machine jump from one reality has effected billions and billions of other realities in the process, one which happened to be the reality that ecco 1 was set in.  So no matter what, ecco had to travel back in order to help the asterite help him.  Then agin, this time jump of ecco's will probably affect another billion billion realities itself as well.  I just remembered a few sentences ago that may help in this.  All Dragon ball Z fans will understand this better if they recall the situatuion of Trunks and those androids and how cell came to be.  This time stuff is quite hard to picture, but it is quite an interesting practice in theory
