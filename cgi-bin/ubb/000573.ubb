It will be even better online.  There are three types of people, hunters, rangers, and forces.  Hunters specialize in swords, rangers in guns, and forces with magic.  I won't go more in depth about the races, which by the way are preset(no newman ranger!).<br>You have a creature following you around as in many RPGs that actually does seriously help you, and you train it also.  There called MAGs and can perform a lot of actions.<p>I'm interested in forming a team with some people herebut no one here has responded so far....

I can re-post it here if you like. I'm not much good at Japanese so my own attempt of a translation probably wasn't too accurate.
