My name is Pharphignewton, which is short for Edward Jericho Fortesque-Pharphignewton-Bob.  I like things that interest me, and I hate anyone who thinks with a closed mind.  Sex and color are two stupid reasons to hate anyone.  I do hate one thing, though:  my job at McDonald's [insert angry words here].  Why can't people just put on their extra ketchup themselves?! Anywhoo, hi, hello, how are you, merry Christmas, joyous Thanksgiving, and other words.  Have a nice day, and I appreciate you listening (reading?) to my mindless gabbing.  goodbye, now, and may you all be well and dream of golden doorknobs! <IMG SRC="smilie9.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="glowing">

Any help would be appreciated.  Also I know I'm just stupid for asking this, but how do you put on a face pic once you have one?
