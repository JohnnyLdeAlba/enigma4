A||||26||Cortex Vortex||my leaving of this place
Z||000000||Cortex Vortex||02-02-2001||04:11 AM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||People i have decided to leave this place because of coral and psysonic moslty i might not be back for a few months or maybe even years. coral and psysonic think i'm so childish and starting a flamewar on a topic i posted here but if you look at it closesly they are the ones staring the war so for my leaving you have those two to thank well i guess this is goodbye for me i will be posting here for a few days untill i finally go well bye.

Z||000004||yogoat||02-02-2001||10:38 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||Psy, you're a good friend to me, but lay off of Cortex.  If you're having problems with him, just ignore him.  I'm not gonna stand by and watch you drive everyone you have a problem with away.  If there's still time, cortex is STAYING.  I hate to be harsh with a good friend of mine like you, but this is going too far...and the same goes to you, Coral.  I don't necessarily give a rat's ass if you leave or not, so I probably won't lighten any up on you...and you too, cortex!  Just don't read what psysonic and coral have to say.  You don't need to hear their bullshit.  And Psy-Coral, really.  Sometimes it's best to keep the thoughts to yourself, and if you don't like him, leave or shut up.<p>"Are you <i>sure</i> men can't get pms??"

I cannot believe this!<br>Was I possessed by the Devil or what?!<br>I WAS acting like a 2 year old! I WAS acting like an idiot!<br>I cannot believe that I actually did those horrible things!!! I was such a bad mood and I took it out on you, Cortex.<br>I am a bad person now. <br>I can't even type I'm so horrified!<br>I'm so sorry, Cortex.<br>I apologize for everything wrong I have done.<br>I was being a complete retard!<br>I am so sorry.

Well, Cortex said in a different post that he is sorry and I think he understood now. I don't understand why he is leaving now though... It is all right for me when he stays now, cause he seems to understand that his posts were offensive, and guys, didn't you ever think too, that his posts were annoying and aggressive? Is it now really only Coral and me who are the asses around?<p>Cortex, I have to apologize if I offended you, like I said always before, I don't want to make people leave anymore, even if it seems to be so. You seem to have understood that you weren't always acting nice so I forgive you. I hope it's all right now, I didn't want to make you leave. So please stay and be cool!<p>I hope it's all solved now again!<p><br>Well, anyway, I'm ill and that is why I might not be around here for the weekend. I guess I will look around anyways... Seeyas

Z||000015||Coral||02-04-2001||06:09 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Well, fine then!<br>I'll just beat myself right now. So if you'll excuse me, I have a house to jump off of!
Z||000016||yogoat||02-04-2001||07:12 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||Can I jump off, too?
Z||000017||Cortex Vortex||02-05-2001||02:50 AM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||Well ok i think i might stay for a while listen since i'm not a geek i'll forgive you right now quickly so here i forgive you guys and cotal i'm not the person to beat you up if you appolagies so take the punching bag away cause anyway i already have a real punching bag at my house people even though i might be back i won't be ablle to visit much because i'm in intermidieate school or shall i say junior high so there i forgive you two.
