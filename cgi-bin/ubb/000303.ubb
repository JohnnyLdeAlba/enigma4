And Blackfin, is there any chance of getting Sigs up and running, or do I have to post the image in everything I reply to?<p>As for Face pics, you can ask someone to do one for you, then upload it to your site/webspace, and then use UBB code or HTML to post it in your message.<p><img src="http://redfireknux.homestead.com/files/ez/vortex.jpg">

Crestoe can draw a face pic for you.<br>I just want to draw pictures of peoples dolphin.

I want one... but I don't know if Crest will want to draw a face pic for me since he's already doing a picture of a the dolphin I made... (just outta the kindness of his heart he said my dolphin sounds cool, I didn't ask him to draw it...) You could try one for me! Want a description?
Z||000005||Coral||10-28-2000||02:06 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  No not exactly. I don't want to make a face pic, but a picture of someone for Blackfin's fan art. And yeah give me a description and I'll try and figure out how to get it on the fan art.

I don't watch that show but Charisma does. I'll have to ask her, ok. Do you want your dolphin jumping, like mine (poking head out of water), or underwater?<br>I feel like I work at McDonald's. Want fries with that?
Z||000014||Charisma||10-29-2000||02:15 PM||kailin79@hotmail.com||Hey, Friecco.<br>  Let's discuss DBZ. I absolutely love that show.<br>  Who's your favorite character?<br>  Mine's Vegata. *sorta*<br>

Z||000023||Friecco||10-30-2000||08:26 AM||nikovic@brockfan.zzn.com||Yup!!!!!
Z||000024||Coral||10-30-2000||04:58 PM||ntraver@epix.net||I never knew Frieza had a big bulg thing on its head that was purple! I drew it wrong! <br>The outline is purple and there is a big purple stripe down the middle and everything else is white. Is that okay because I like that better.
