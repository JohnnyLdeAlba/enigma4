Due to the rush currentlly a lot of features I had planned to implement are missing such as the 'smilies' and the custom icons.  I will complete these features in about a months time.  If you want to read any of the post in the old forum they can be found <A HREF="http://www.ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz/forums/The_Undercaves_-_Forum">here</A>
