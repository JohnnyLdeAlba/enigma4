Therefore I'm changing it to something a little more... Sci Fi<p>The Vortex's initial plan for securing the food supply to Earth has failed. They have lost a Queen. The Vortex Hive will not accept that a puny blue green planet has denied them their answer to food shortage, and plans to try again, with a bigger fleet.<p>Vortex scouts, though scattered, remained on Earth. Those that escaped the vengeful Dolphins managed to secure a message to the main Vortex Hive. Informing of Earth's Hero's loss in the Tides of Time. Wasting no time, they set a course to Earth. With the mission to destroy the Atlantian TIme Machine, and secure Earth as 'The Second Hive'<p>As the main attack fleet assembles at the Vortex Homeworld. The Asterite calls out for another savior, to lead Earth, now that Ecco was lost. <p>The Call was answered by a single, lone, Dolphin.<p>Summoned before the Asterite, a new hero begins her quest. The legend of Ecco always within her mind. She begins a journey, from the doomed future of Earth, to the Vortex Homeworld itself! In an effort to stop the vile creatures from destroying all life on Earth, and removing any hope of ever restoring the legend of Ecco.<p>And so the story begins...<p><br>Like it?

Z||000003||Trace Kyshad||12-07-2000||11:16 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||I pondered with the idea of using a Non-Dolphin character for a leading role, but then I left it for a while.<p>If anything, there'll be a chance to fly one of those Flying Dolphins of the future, in defense of Vortex Airbornes
Z||000004||Histronic||12-07-2000||09:24 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||That would be kewl!  Ecco should make an appearence and come back to help, perhaps.  You can edit his sprite so he has scars and stuff from living in prehistory.
