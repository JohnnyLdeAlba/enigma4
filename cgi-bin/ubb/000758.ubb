A||||15||Miana||YO! Mama Miana is back!
Z||000000||Miana||04-13-2001||02:02 PM||trixie2@mindspring.com||Okay then. =)<br>yeah I haven't been around, and I won't bore you with excuses. As I always seem to be saying them -_-*<br>But other than that, I have two announcements the first one is that last Friday was my 16th birthday. =) Not that anyone impaticularly cares.<br>the second one is that, I've been asked if I would continue with story based on my nightmare. I said that I wouldn't because I'm not sure if I would still do any on Ecco the Dolphin. Reason is, is that I fear that if I get too gory, or too gothic, or depressing, or whatever.., I offend a lot of people. Also that my ideas are a little different as well.<br>So I ask if any would still be interested with what I write? And if enough say go for it, then I'll try my best to write it out.<p>So if you want to read, just tell me.<br>Peace to everyone, and it's great to see you all again!!! =)<p>~ Miana, Guardian of the Time Stream

I know you and I don't really know each other, but I've always enjoyed you on the forums. I think that's cool if you're back! Oh, and:<p><b><font color=00FF00 size="+2">Happy Birthday, Miana!</font></b><br> <IMG SRC="http://www.animfactory.com/animations/holiday_events/birthday/birthday_cake_confetti_md_clr.gif"> <p>Belated, I guess... <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> ...but still! And 16?! That's a fun age to turn! And about your writing...well...the little I've read was great! Don't worry about who you'll offend, because artists will often do so...it's the nature of it. Some will like it though...and that's what's important! I say "go for it"...definately! Anyway, nice to see you back Miana, and hope to see you around more now!
