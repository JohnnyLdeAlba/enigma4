Z||000000||Arkonviox||10-01-2000||04:37 PM||www.arkonviox@prodigy.net||I was thinking if it would be well worth the trouble to make my homegrown ecco game 3D.<br>I'm interested into getting a 3D modler so I can use in making it. One thing is it wont be any DOF thats for sure for reasons that I want it to work on everyones computer but imagine the new chrono trigger begining and that may be what my game looks like you know the press start screen. Tell me what you think and if anyone knows programming tell me if its too much trouble, I'm learning physics to help do this project so thats a start.

The physics are the easy part. I don't know your level of programming but making the engine and getting it to run quickly and cleanly can be tricky. <br>But to tell you the truth I think that with a bit of effort you can make a very sweet looking 2d game. Maybe using some 3d code to make sort of a scrolling 2d effect with high detail images would be very nice. The other thing is are you doing this on your own or with other people?<br>Personally I'm sick of everything needing to be in 3d and only being good if it is in 3d. I still like good old 2d games! Anyways that's my 2 cents on the matter.

I personally would reconmend a 2D game for now and prehaps try rewritting it in 3D after you finish it.
Z||000004||Arkonviox||10-02-2000||02:05 AM||www.arkonviox@prodigy.net||I've been debating the idea since I got ahold of a graphics modler for programmers and all that other stuff. But I do keep forgetting it's not an easy task to do 3D but! I have seen people do it on there own!!! Maybe if I can get ahold of some routines to help me out and as you said blackfin do it like DOF's passage from genesis style then have maybe one 3D level which I was thinking of where ecco fights a battle similiar to the end of sonic adventure when sonic has to face perfect choas. Well see what happens I need more time Oh and archcomet my skills are very beginer I know standard C but never programed graphics and for multitasking OS's ive had a little exposure but I will work to getting direct X and game concepts soon!<p>Wow it's nice to see alot of programmers but I need to ask is anyone else working on big projects???
Z||000005||Delphi||10-22-2000||08:50 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Big? *laughs quietly* No. Not big. I'm working on stories. A kinda small story is in the works right now. I don't have the dedication to work on a big project...

However, if you want to dive into 3D game creation, you may want to look at JaMagic,<p><img src="http://www.clickteam.com/website/images/jama/jama_sea.jpg"> for one picture, and for reading more,  go to http://www.clickteam.com/website/jama/about_cadre.htm

I'm best at QBasic (lol), but I'm learning C++ and Direct X programming. I'd like to help with one of the numerous ecco games being developed right now, but the creators are so secretive! I can't find anything out.<p>I've got some of my stuff at http://www.angelfire.com/me2/xcrispy/<p>X-Crispy
