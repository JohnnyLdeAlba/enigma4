I have just one question: What do you use to color your pictures, and what are your techniques?  I thought that your color style would be perfect for the new comic I'm developing.  If you reply, it would be much appreciated.  Really.  Seriously.  You absolutely must.  Thanks

I learned the program when I went to college, and now use it on my home PC. Even bought a expesive book about the program but never use it. I just learned on the fly...  <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge"> <p>Lots of the dragon stuff and dolpin stuff also is done with acrylic paints on all sorts of stuff. Canvas, masonite, paper...etc. Some are also done with water colors or colored pencils. <p>I hope that helps...at least a little bit.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
