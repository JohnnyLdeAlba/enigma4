I'm so glad you won! It's so cool <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> Now it's proved that you are one of the best artists around here. And that Vantid's picture has missed by only point it also proves that she's one of the best artists! But you deserve it, Rep! You really deserve it to be the winner!!! I'm so proud of you <i>*sigh*</i> Congrats! ^_^

My drawings are like 2 year old's scribbles compared to Reptyx's and Vantid's pictures.<br>Someday, I'll be the one of the best artists.<br>I still need LOADS of practice. I just drew a really cool dragon today! I'm really proud of myself!!!<p>Back to the topic.<br>Congrats Reptyx!!!
