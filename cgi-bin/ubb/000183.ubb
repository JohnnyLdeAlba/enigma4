Appaloosa has made games for other consoles but ecco isnt going no where because appaloosa made ecco especialy for sega. But I could be wrong, I may have them contact me one day after my game is finished or I may have to contact them to see if I can make bucks $_$ now theres a new face for ya barbar!

Thus Ecco could appear on *gasp* the X-Box.  Appaloosa will probably keep this game to Sega though, and most of Sega's developers are doing the same with series that have been in the past exclusively for Sega.
