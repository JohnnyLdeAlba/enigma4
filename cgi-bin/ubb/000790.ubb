There's only so much you can do with a Dreamcast controller, but maybe there's a better way to control a 3D game like Ecco with it.<p>The current system uses the analog stick to look around vertically -- press Up to look down, and Left to look left. To actually move, you have to turn first, then keep tapping the Swim button.<p>What if you used the analog stick to move around horizontally? Press Up to move forward at varying speeds, and Left to immediately turn left and go that way. You'd then use two of the buttons to rise and sink. This way you'd get analog control over movement speed, and would be better able to see what you're doing in situations like the shark battle or secret soccer level.<p>What do you think?<p>(I could be studying or sleeping now...)
