Most things in this alternate future are different, and that includes the seagulls and the sounds they make.

I find it very difficult to get frustrated about this level because it looks so incredible AND I think its a lot of fun! My only problem with it(if you can believe this) is I think its much too short! I play it over and over and over. The long vacuum jelly tubes after Ice and Fire is indeed the hardest part(and also the least enjoyable), but wait till' you get to the squid and the switches! NEAT!
