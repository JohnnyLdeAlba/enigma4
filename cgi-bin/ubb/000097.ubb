A||||11||PsySonic||Ecco 2 Beta: Interesting Things/Guide
Z||000000||PsySonic||09-14-2000||03:31 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||OK, Just a small overview of the interesting things in the Ecco 2 Beta (or call it a guide through the game till the level i can't get through):<p>- The intro has the large Vortex Queen head from Ecco 1 falling through the sky added<p>- I guess the intro background where the Vortex Queen is a small fireball is changed<p>- Also in the intro the dolphin family swim together from the left side to the right side (in the Home Bay), at the last few seconds Ecco alone makes some jumps (just like in the intro of Ecco 1).<p>- Let the Demo run and you see the Tubes of Medusa level. It's at a pretty finished level, only the tubes aren't moving.<p>- Also in the Demo a TOTALLY NEW VORTEX FUTURE LEVEL is played!!! This is VERY GOOD amount of information! You see Ecco in the familiar designed Vortex future but it has new items. The Flashes are still there. But there are some ends of windpipes or so and when Ecco sings at them bubbles come out of them (blue bubbley and red bubbles). I think they do the same like Health Shells. And at the end of this demonstration ECCO MEETS A METALLIC SHARK which seems to be the LEVEL BOSS! I hope to find out about Cheat codes or Game Genie Codes to enter this level!<p>- The first playable level is also a never seen level! You have to ask the dolphin which swims left and right at the bottom of the ground for help. He will guide you through the level to the end! YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE END or you can't pass the current at the end of the level! Also interesting are the bubbles of the currents, health shells etc. - They're really BIG! This level was meant to be the FOURTH STAGE - kill yourself by drowning and see the intro page!<p>- The second level is a 3D level. It's also pretty finished. Only the shells look strange and when you get a ring you won't be zoomed towards a new area but remain at the place where you hit it. Perhaps the rings were actually not meant to be teleport rings. They also affect the Air Meter at the top left. If you miss rings the Meter will low and if you collect it will refresh. And it takes a long time till you have passed the level! Also the bubbles are strangely coloured...<p>- The third level is a Beta version of the Final "Two Tides". It calls itself in the Beta "Third Stage"... Not much to say since it is close to the Final, but when you enter the area where rocks fall from top to bottom there is an earthquake like in the final "Fault Zone". And at the end of the level you meet a dolphin which says something like "Who are you, if you want to go straight on, give me a fish". The Beta-"Give-Me-A-Fish"-Dolphin <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> And the "Give-Me-A-Fish"-Fish is bigger and easier to find than the final fish!<p>- The fourth level is another 3D-Stage. Not much to say, only that there are Jellyfish and something really strange: FLYING SHELLS! I guess they had been replaced with the final eagles because the programmers hadn't finished the eagle sprites.<p>- Level 5 is the Beta version of "Moray Abyss". And it is also very close to the Final One. Enemies and Boss are the same as in the Final version (Fortunately you can't drown or die <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> ). When you've defeated it, also the two spheres of the Asterite come out and he says something very strange what actually dolphins tell you about health shells - he seems to be even more confused in the Beta <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> You don't exit the level by swimming up into the teleport ring but by swimming to the right side into the teleport ring.<p>- Level 6 is maybe a Beta of "The Eye" but I'm not sure since I haven't played it for a long time. No enemies or other sprites, only you and the background - AND: The first two spheres of the Asterite again! But they don't do anything than swinging... In the top left corner is a teleport ring, if you enter it you go back to Moray Abyss (Not the actual level "Asterites Cave" where you build up the Asterite) and you can also defeat the monsters and Boss again. If you drown in the sixth level you're sent back to "Mooray Abyss". There seems to be no way to pass this level without using codes...<p><br>OK, I hope you enjoyed this (especially the ones who are not able to play the Beta). I hope we can get to further levels soon!<p>Bye, Psy

In this beta there was a level which you need to find yourself, that had a glyph puzzle like the normal ecco 2, which was in cystal springs. Find this puzzle and solve it then lightining will come from the glyph and a dolphin will appear out of time. I guess this was trellia, the dolphin of the future, before it was done.<p>-Another thing to notice is a dolphin in the bad future which is robotic and has a piercing nose.<p> <IMG SRC="C<IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well">a.JPG">  <p><br>
Z||000002||Seaman||09-14-2000||05:08 PM||www.seaman@vivarium.com||Well so much for the image but anyways psysonic thats not shark it is a robotic dolphin of the dark future.<br>
Z||000003||Histronic||09-14-2000||05:46 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||I, for one, did not like the opening scene.  The Vortex head looks like stock footage from a B-Movie to me.  (Please don't start a flame war.) <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">  I think it is impossible for her to crash through the burn of Earth's atmosphere naked, without a spaceship or even a suit or something.  I think that Appaloosa realized this and took it out.<p>As for the robotic shark debate, I think it is just a creature from the Vortex homeworld.  Why the hell would they make a robotic shark?  It could be like the current Vortex Queen's pet.  I wish I could get a better look at it, but the scene cuts off in the middle of the fight.  It looks like Ed at Appaloosa is going to get a TON of emails.<p>A few other things.  The beta doesn't accept the debug code from the final Ecco Two.  If it did, we would be able to explore the ROM thoroughly, like was done with Sonic 2 Beta.  (Note for Sonic fans: Someone is recovering the sprites from Genocide City!)<p>Speaking of Genocide Cities, I really like the look of Ecco Beta's Dark Future, but it doesn't look like it would be entertaining to play.  I like the final version's better.<br>--<br>Histronic

Z||000005||Eao||09-16-2000||09:27 AM||collprin@warwick.net||wow trella futue!  can you send me the save state (if useing Dgen)  oh and you can swim threw rock in 'the eye' but when you do the globs dissapere.
Z||000006||PsySonic||09-16-2000||10:18 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Reptyx, how do I die in Moray Abyss? Or could you also send me a savestate?<p>Seaman, I don't think it's a robotic dolphin because it's an ENEMY - when Ecco touches it, he loses energy!
Z||000007||PsySonic||09-16-2000||11:23 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Reptyx, I got into this Trellia Future Level (for all those how didn't find out yet - after you defeated the boss and the asterite appears you simply have to drown yourself!).<p>This new Trellia level is really interesting. First: it is LARGE! it's a large system of underwater tubes which are all diagional... but that's not the main point of the level! when you swim right at the beginning you will find 4 glyphs arranged in a square. when you sing at them they do the same as in the final "Crystal Springs". And when you loosen one from its place and take them to the underwater cave at the right side of the glyphs there will be this gruop of glyphs which move around the small star like in Crystal Springs. Then when they are all together the will go into each other (also like in CS) AND: *FLASHES* come it the one appearing glyph and A *DOLPHIN*!!! I appears like trellia does in the final and it also acts like trellia when Ecco meets him first - he sings to him and then they go into the future. And most interesting of this: After the time (and another 3D level *ugh*) you appear with this new dolphin in the beta level which actually comes after Moray Abyss. And the dolphin says to you: "We are now in the *GOOD FUTURE*".<p>This is all WEIRD!!! This Sea of Green type level was supposed to be a Good Future Level... But actually you get FROM a final Good Future like level into a final Present like level...<p>Oh man, this really is totally crazy!
Z||000008||Reptyx||09-16-2000||03:51 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com||I've got a savestate for KGen, and one for Genecyst...<p>Have you noticed they use the same music on every level? They could at least've picked a better song! <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="roll eyes"><br>
Z||000009||Eao||09-16-2000||04:02 PM||collprin@warwick.net||i tryed drownding myself.i got the same thing.<p>also, when you drownd in The level with the unreachable sphers, you seem to get a "second" life, i did that and i saw one red globe, this happned once.  Also on the sonar map, there are yellow spiky things.indacating an enimy...when nothing is there.
Z||000010||PsySonic||09-17-2000||02:50 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||I think they didn't import so many background musics because the final wasn't meant to have Ecco 1 music. Maybe they imported this song just to see how the atmosphere is when you play the game... I think there were two songs from Ecco 1 - One from "The Vents" and one from "Ridge Water", but it could also have been "The Lagoon". I mostly play the PC version so I can't remember...<p>I saw these yellow circles which indicate enemies but there are no on nearly all sonar maps - I think they're only bugs like they appear all over the game. E.g. in the "Two Tides" level when you solve the first barrier glyph and hit the ground on the right side of it you get hit.<p>Have you noticed that when you drown in Moray Abyss that the screen turns red and you get to somewhere else in the level? Only when I drowned after this weird procedure I got into the Trellia level...<p>What was that for a red globe? When I drown in the level after Moray Abyss I get into Moray Abyss....
