Z||000000||dragonboy||11-14-2000||07:58 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||a simple question.  any variety at all, bottle nose, orca, river, etc.  I would like to be dolphin, to swim the currents of the unknown seas, to play around with my podmates, and move around in a truly 3d environment, any direction, any time. all things have their drawbacks, i know, but to be dolphin, what an experience that would be.

To be able to swim, and do flips out of the water like they do would be incredibly awsome!!!<p><i>*drifts off to dreamland*</i>

There aren't even words to describe how cool that would be! Although I don't know if I'd want to be a dolphin for the rest of my life. Being a human has its advantages, such as the ability to manipulate things around me with my hands, and the vast knowledge that humans have access to.<br>I don't think humans are "bad" because I don't believe there is such thing as a "bad species". Organisms just do their best to survive, including us. But if there was such thing as a "bad" species, it would certainly be us!<br>Dolphins have a level freedom that humans have not attained. Spending days swimming, diving, jumping, playing, and just being curious would be wonderful.<p>X-Crispy

I'm curious how dolphins feel when they communicate and how they think and stuff. And of course how to swim like I dolphin through endless seas...<p>But actually I'm more the hedgehog type <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000008||dragonboy||11-16-2000||07:47 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||do you have a real hedgehog, psy?  my family had one three years ago.  it was a funny, prickly little guy who only liked my mom and sister (cuz they spent more time with him).  I admit he was cute, but he spent most of his time sleeping under his log. 
Z||000009||Coral||11-16-2000||08:54 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://arknoviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Yeah, it would be cool to be a dolphin. I would like to be a spotted dolphin. I think I would make great dolphin because I like to swim and I sometimes eat sushi. I have no problem with that.<br>Although you have to be extremely careful because of sharks, drift nets, and Japanese fishermen. Other than that, it would be awesome to be a dolphin for at least a week or 2.

They are wild here in Europe but I see often some in garden or on the roads in the warm summer evenings when the roads are warm (the hedgehogs are either flat or alive <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> - mean ). And the have short spines, I've seen pictures of hedgehogs with long spines and I remember I saw one in the zoo...<p>But I actually also don't want to have a hedgehog. I wouldn't have enough time for him...

I've dreamed about it soooooo much... and I even wrote an Animorphs story so I could be one... LOL<p>PS if you don't know what Animorphs is, it's a series of books written by KA Applegate about kids who turn into different types of animals to fight evil aliens. GOOD BOOKS! Read one. I recommend #4, because they turn into dolphins in it!!!!
Z||000012||blackfin||11-20-2000||09:43 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I love the Animorph books, I've most of them.  Everytime I get one of them I just drop everything and read it straight away. <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
