Z||000007||PsySonic||01-14-2001||05:21 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||I tell you what my problem with you is:<p>When you and Crestoe were banned everything got fine. Well, OK, not at all, cause you kept on making fun of us (speaking of "Blundercaves 2000") and other things I read on your forum. Well, but wierdly it got all fine when your site was down. How comes that? I wonder... Everybody was calm, we had nice threads here, even I posted regularly. I forgot about you, yes, after a really bad time for me when everytime you spoke to me I got into a bad mood, I had a nice time. And when somebody said your name I thought, oh yeah, the guy who drove one of my best friends (Silverfin) away, but that was all, it got fine after seconds. And the best thing always was: I was quiet sure that Blackfin would never let you return!<p>It isn't you *now* who annoys me, I guess you might be fine now. It is that everytime I see your name it always reminds me of the bad times in this community. And I'm really afraid that these times return. Even if not, you will always remind me of the bad times, of Silverfin, of the flame wars you always started, of the war of the websites, those are all memories I get when I see your name. And that makes me feel bad. I guess you can imagine that I don't want that and if I stay here I will always see your name, I don't want that. Maybe I would get used to it, but there are other things right now in my head and you added to them won't do me any good.<p>And even if Blackfin is watching you now, how does that make it better. Imagine, you go wild again, Blackfin will feel bad again, thinking again about months if he should ban you or not, then he does, you'll laugh about him and us or make fun of us or whatever, that will make us all a bad mood again.<p>I don't understand you Blackfin. I told you all this some days ago and you seemed to understand that, now seem not to, you've let him in again, the circle of nightmares has been started again. I think you won't ban him now again out of no reason, so there is only one possibility for me: to leave.<p>Of course I'll still look in this community sometimes. I won't say anything, though. I think I'll also stay in chat to see if some nice people are there to talk to. I can't leave this community so promptly. But it won't be the same like in the last month, that was the best time for me in this community I think. I really enjoyed it! And that is why I like all of you who were here in the last month until this here happened. I really like you all and I'll miss you all!<p>And now I only have to say a last word: Bye!
Z||000008||Cortex Vortex||01-14-2001||05:43 AM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||i know how you feel psysonic i was kind of getting used to arkon being away now he's back i forgot all about him and i don't no weither it's good to have him back or not but i think  it's good that he's come back but i'm not sure.
Z||000009||PsySonic||01-14-2001||08:34 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/psysonic.jpg"> <br>OK, I've thought about this again and I've come to a conclusion for me about this. I'll stay here again, so I won't leave this place even though Arkonviox and Crestoe are here again. I don't forgive you all the damage you've done here, though, Arkonviox. I don't know how I will deal with you from now on, I think I'll just ignore you.<p>We will see for how long you can pretend your "new, nice" identity, I guess in some weeks or months you'll become the normal Arkonviox, the one we know and hate, but we will see.<p>The reason why I stay here is this strong community, and the way I love to be here! That is why I can't just go away from, even though how much pain you'll give me only for being here. The people here come first for me!<p>But it might also be that I stay here because I got to Hanging Waters an hour ago and I'm kind of happy about this level! I love it! YES! <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>Sorry for the irritation, pals, but I think some or most of you can imagine why I reacted this way.<p>You all have me back now ^_^

Z||000013||dolphingirl||01-14-2001||04:55 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com|| <IMG SRC="http://arkonviox.com/fp/2dolphingirl.jpg">  PsySonic, I'm sorry you feel that way. I understand why you do, but I think it'd be a bit harsh if you left just because Arkonviox and Crestoe have come back. So, I'm glad you decided to stay.<p>I know you don't understand blackfin's decision, but that's what it was...his decision to bring them back. And about forgiving them, that's okay if you don't feel you can do that, right now. But maybe, hopefully, there'd be a slight chance of you doing that on down the road, after you've seen him change. Even if you never do forgive him, that's fine too. I'm sure you both will just stay out of each others' way. And he has agreed to do that, if necissary.<p>But if you ask me...I think it's safe to say that I know Arkonviox very well...perhaps, better than anyone here! So I think you're wrong...scratch that...I know you're wrong when you say, <i>"We will see for how long you can pretend your 'new, nice' identity"</i>! Pretend?!? Let me tell you...he's not pretending! And that's fine if you don't believe me now, infact I'm sure you're in disagreement right this very second. But, I think it would do you some good to just give him time, and then you'll see...he's not pretending.<p>I hope my post hasn't made you mad PsySonic, because I like you...you're very cool! I like chating with you too...it's fun! I just thought I could give some insight about the matter. I think it's great that Arkon and Crestoe are back...but you see, that's my opinion, and we're all entitled to our own. The hard part is keeping the respect there, even if you don't agree. So I sincerely hope that the way I feel for them, won't make you turn your back on me. I just hope you will stay, like you say you're going to do, and maybe for now, you two can just steer clear of each other. There's no harm in that now...is there?!?<p>Okay, I'll shut up now... I just had to get that out... <i>*dolphingirl sighs*</i>
Z||000014||Cortex Vortex||01-14-2001||05:16 PM||andrej@brockfan.zzn.com||i hope psysonic is mad that's behaving like a little child psysonic people change psysonic your expecting arkon isn't changed but he is for now even if you think arkon is faking it take advantedge and be friends so if he is not changed then you can say i don't care i was only pretending to like you and you can even tell me i told you so and crestoe you don't have to be mad at me i like you guys i think people who think you havn't changed are wrong and anyway i don't care if you changed or not it's the same for me.

However, i feel that in the 4 short days ive been away this site has changed from lighthearted and fun to some dark and serious soap opera with a bad ending coming up. I know ive probably missed these "flame wars" and the origin of all this animosity, but ive only just found this website and this community and i worry about its future stability with these new posts. anyway, hi arkon im glad to finally meet you.
