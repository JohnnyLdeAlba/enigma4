Mere yards from shore, their fins and heads lift above the water as they pass by(saw an orca once). Its really neat, but I don't know what kind of dolphin they are(mover, circle or crimson? Just kiddin').<p>Also I heard this dolphin story(Its True!) in Europe somewhere, I think its Itally, there is this group of dolphins that hang around the Meditterainian(is that right?) Sea. So one day, a kid on a boat fell overboard and he was drowning. Then a dolphin swims over and lifts the kid up so he can breathe and carries over to the shore. He sounds like a nice guy eh?
