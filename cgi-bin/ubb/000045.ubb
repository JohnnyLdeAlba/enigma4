I am stuck at the end of level 9 of DOTF because I cannot go through the rings properly in order to reach the gem on top of the cathedral.  Is there a trick for this?  Is there a way to proceed without doing this?  I have been trying for hours and am getting very frustrated! I can go through the rings quickly.. I just never get high enough to reach the crystal.  Any help is appreciated!

Get the power of vigour (it's at the end of the canyon), swim under the rings so that you can look up them and see through them all in a staight line, then swim up through them as fast as possible (don't charge, use the other button to slowly build up your speed) and all going well you should hit the gem...
