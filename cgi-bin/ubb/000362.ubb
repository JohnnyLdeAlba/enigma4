But I wouldn't say it's the greatest thing out there...! I would have to say though, that the snowboarding game, SSX, is incredibly awsome--better than all the previous snow games!!! However, I've heard that the sport games aren't really all that. So in general, the game system is pretty cool, but I wouldn't go all out crazy trying to get one. I'd give it a little while, especially for the game developers to take advantage of all the system can offer. That's my opinion though...<IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">

Z||000004||dragonboy||11-05-2000||03:50 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||yeah, there is no greater evidence how the bain of materialism is very strong, negative force than at christmas time.  anyone remember the cabbage patch kid year, or tickle me elmo?.  now its playstation 2.  I heard it can play dvds too, be used as a modem, and be used as a word processor somehow.  but i'm not sure
Z||000005||Charisma||11-05-2000||06:50 PM||kailin79@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonvox.com/artwork/fcharisma.gif">  Yeah, people are being mugged on the street!  My cousin said that if we wanted one we'd have to wait after Christmas. <br> Oh, I've heard you could also play DVD's too, but we'll have to wait and see.

The Plastation 2 can play DVD movies, however, it's not quite as nice as a player you buy specifically for that...which SONY has already admitted to. But it does play 'em and the picture is still a heck of a lot better than a VCR! There is a hook-up in the back of the console for a modem, but it will be a while (heard something like at least a year) till it's available, and you'll have to purchase it (unlike the Dreamcast that comes with a modem). Not sure about the word processor thing, but it's possible seeing how there are USB ports on the front of the console. And again, you'll have to purchase the accessories needed....but that's what I know on the issue.
