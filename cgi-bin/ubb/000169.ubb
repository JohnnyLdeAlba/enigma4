A||||7||That guy with the hat||In regards to what Dragonboy said before about the foe or vortex...

They look like they are not built to handle much and they have a very unsophisticated spoken language(if its even that). Despite what Ecco the Dolphin(the one on this messageboard) said about how we probably would look equally strange to them, I don't think that really changes the argument that they seem much to unintelligent to have constructed such things that look so much like they were done maybe even by human hands. Perhaps there are humanlike creatures from where the foe or vortex come from, but if that is so, why would they consent to have a stupid(stupid in the sense of unintelligent) beast like the foe/vortex queen to be their supreme ruler? It just don't add up!<br>

She could create different breeds of the same race, as we've seen with both the Vortex and the Foe.  Many are different in appearance.  Some would probably be worker drones or the like.  Some breed may have some intelligence.  The Queen creates all of these though, and that's why she's the queen.

I always nitpick on the reality of shows or books.  I think there may be a far out explanation for the foe/vortex's technological advancement.  maybe they attacked another species and took over their civilization and along with that, their technology.  I guess i'm ecco-obsessed.

Z||000004||That guy with the hat||10-05-2000||12:15 AM||||Actually we do see one worker. The caretaker arm creature in hatchery(I hate that level). I'm pretty sure its not mechanical even though it makes those *click whirr grind* noises. if you look closely after you kill it, you will see some bones sticking out of what looks like bloody flesh. Maybe its bionic?

Z||000007||Ecco The Dolphin||10-05-2000||07:51 PM||eccodolphin@hotmail.com||Actually, most Vortex do have hands.  One sometimes see the hands if they look closely.  I have the Sega CD(Mega CD) version and in the video glyphs the normal Vortex warriors do have hands, albeit ones with sharp claws.
