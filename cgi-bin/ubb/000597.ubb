I could also bid for the game but it is very expensive (nearly as high as the original price) so I will let and just show you the scans <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>Here they are:<br> <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/ecco-japanese1.jpg">  <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/ecco-japanese2.jpg"> <p>Unfortunately they are very small and cheap scans but at least you can see some great (and new) artwork!
