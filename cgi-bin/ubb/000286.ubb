I wondered, also, if maybe you could have a log-in screen before we got to the forum, because sometimes, if you are writing a lot of messages or replies, writing out you're username and password can be a little tedious. Just a suggestion, there is probably a reason you have it like this. Other than that, this is undoubtedly the BEST Ecco site on the web.

It works like this (just an example):<p>user/name: some crap like that<br>password: ************<p>The Gator asks you:<p>DO YOU WANT GATOR TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU TYPED IN?<p>Just say "YES"<p>so whenever you come here or anywhere else just click "FILL IN"<p>P.S. the GATOR should automatically appear<br>and ask you.<p><br>(It even fills out the forms for you, like<br>Name, Address, E-Mail... stuff like that).<p>Here's the Website:<p> <A HREF="http://www.gator.com" TARGET=_blank>www.gator.com</A>
