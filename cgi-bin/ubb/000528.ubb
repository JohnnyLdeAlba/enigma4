Back in Spetember, the eldest female dolphin at the same mall died because she had a coin fetish and would swallow small objects that patrons would throw into the pool. <p><br>*Sigh* this is quite depressing, they should really release the two remaining animals or move them to a better facility, ecspecialy after this...

How would those people like it if they had coins shoved down their throats!!!
