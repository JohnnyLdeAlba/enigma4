Z||000001||dragonboy||11-02-2000||09:09 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||The best person to help you do this would be blackfin. what you would do would to email him (blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz) your picture of your dog.  i hope you know how to do an attachment to email!  then black will put your picture on his photo page (not accesible to see without his permission) so your pic will have its own URL.  If you want black to post it for you, he will.  but it'd be best if he gave you the url and you post it up.  it posts just like your face pic in html,  <IMG SRC="url">  you know, that format.  the only reason i did coral's was cuz she was anxious to have it put up as soon as possible and black told me her pic's url.  I use my expage site to hold my pictures for me, but it seems not everyone can see pets on my post.  oh well.  if you have any more questions, email me or black or respond to this post.

You have a cute dog, Debaser13! Kinda reminds me of my own--she's black too and has some of the same color markings (i.e. sandy colored feet and the white-tipped tail)! I'll have to put her pic up too sometime! Thanks for sharing; I just love dogs! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
