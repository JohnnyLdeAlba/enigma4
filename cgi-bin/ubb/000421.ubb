Z||000000||Riveler||11-23-2000||10:39 PM||riveler@uol.com.br||Yay!! finally!!<br>today (23/11/00) mr. postman brought me a little piece of heaven:<br>my Ecco - Songs of Time soundtrack. It is amazing and I liked all the songs... but none of them seem to be the ones played in games. Why?? I just love the time travel song. I have two questions to do, one about dolphin and other about... well you see:<br>1-- I found the word "porpoise" into the disc chart but in my dictionary this word is missing. What does it mean?? it´s a dolphin synonym?<br>2-- what´s the meaning of the "thanksgiving" hollyday? I´ve seen this so many times in movies and cartoons but I can not "catch" the real meaning?<p>Thank you for the attention, friends!<br>"oh! happy day..."

Thanksgiving used to have a very noble and caring theme.  It was about the sharing of resoirces and general interracial care as the indians and pilgrims illuistrated the first year they met each other. but as you know, that didn't last too long as tye white trash "puritans" became more in love with the land and resouirces than their fellow man <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> well, iys still not too late for us humans to realize the truth
