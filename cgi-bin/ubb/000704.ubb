How are you supposed to p*** those stupid purply things in the Channel of Death without dying for the first time? Everytime I try, I'm subjected to Ecco's annoying, make-me-wanna-throw-the-controller-across-the-room screaming!!! ARGH! I tried the walkthroughs, by the way, and none of them helped... so if you can clue me in, yeah, I'd be appreciative.<p>On a side note, I AM NOT DEAD, IN HIBERNATION OR OTHERWISE IMPAIRED, I still exist, just been picking High School courses, that's all, and, you know, living and such... (lol)

Now, go to that purple fence that you cannot cross, and where there's a clan dolphin on the other side.  Clan dolphins have armor and spikes on their back, just to clue you in.  Now, do a 180 while looking at the fence, drop to the floor, and swim along the right side of the cliff while at the floor, and you <i>should</i> see one of those invisibility thingies.  Grab it, then wait around until you see the big blue fish open his mouth, then swim inside him.  You then beat the level, and you'll advance onto the next.  You're welcome <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

Well, from what you described, it looks as if you are trying to exit the level "the hard way"! See, there are two different ways to finish the level. One, you can lead the school of red to feed an old dolphin, so his son will lead you through that "Channel of Death", as you put it. That's a long strech that is full of these barbed plants! That's the hard way to finish the level!<p>The easier way, is to let something take you out of the level for you -- <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ! In the part of the level with all the fish, is a huge fish, bigger than ecco himself! What you need to do is go to the gate where you can see past it, to the next level (far end of this area). To the left of the gate, is a crack in the wall that hides a Power of Stealth. Get that, and once you're invisible, swim into that giant fish's mouth when it opens...and he'll take you out of there!<p>Hope that helps ya out Delphi...and let me know if you're still stuck...okay?! Good luck to ya... <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">

I was watching a National Geographic show and they showed this animal that looked exactly like the plants excect that...well, it was an animal and it was swimming around. Im thinking taht the creators used that animal as a model for the plant since we all know that they used Nat'l Geo footage for the game.<br>Hmmmmm..... <IMG SRC="smilie25.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="freak"> <br>

It's in the Dolphins Nighmare part of the game...so of course it'd look great! All the levels in that section of the game, if you as me, look the most impressive...I mean, c'mon! Hanging Waters?! How spectacular!!! <IMG SRC="smilie9.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="glowing">
