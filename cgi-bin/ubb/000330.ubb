But my friends were round, and first they wanted to see me die. So I sonared the brute, and just sat there waitin for him to gobble me up. But the pathetic mongoose just swam round me in tight circles, his mouth open, trying to locate me but not getting the angle right. So I TRIED to swim into his mouth, and he turned repeatedly. So I just trapped him then let him eat me. He got more vicous then and did. Why was this weird occurence? Maybe he was just fullup.....
