You see...I'm trying to build a new website. Unlike my first few sites, I'm building this one using Microsoft's FrontPage program. Anyhow...I'm having a really hard time trying to find a host that's: <br>A) Free.<br>and<br>B) Has no banners or pop-up adds.<p>Space isn't an issue. Wheither it's 10MB or 100MBs don't matter to me. All I need is a good host. I have checked out several places, but they either have no FTP or HTTP access or they just plain suck. I want to put this site up SO bad, but at this rate my dolphin site is just gonna sit on my hard drive 'till Hell freezes over! <p>Any help or advice would be welcome at this point!<p>  <IMG SRC="smilie12.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="worried"> ....help!  <br>

Z||000002||DolphinJoy||06-25-2001||04:15 PM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||Snap!  I use Microsoft FrontPage for everything..my latest website, http://www.animamundi.org.uk , was made using that.<p>Anyway, hosts...  I don't know of any host in the WORLD that's free AND doesn't have adverts, but I know of a cheap one.  One website of mine is hosted through AQ , which is cheap but a little unreliable.   Try going to http://www.aq.co.uk .<p>BTW, love your site as it is!  I've left messages on your board before (under the alias "Trellia.")  Thanks for answering all my queries!<p>-Megan/Smeg/DolphinJoy/Trellia/Treefin.......

Your only hope would be to go for one of the smaller hosters, but generally they tend to have SERIOUSLY  ****  bandwidth. I had a site on Cybercities once (this was years ago, they've probably changed) and not only could I only access the FTP once every full moon when there wasn't an R in the month, nobody could ever access the site except after midnight on Tuesdays. Well, that's what it felt like. <p>Personally I'd recommend Spree if you're intending to have an artsite with lots of stuff on it. They don't make you use a homepage builder and you can set the thing for your personal preference: annoying popups vs. banner. Yes, there is a banner. I challenge you to find a decent free host without one. <p>Spree SAY you can have 10Mb, but it used to be 999. I'm not too clear about this or why it's changed, but I've got like five or six sites up on this account, including one that belongs to a friend, and nothing's happened. It used to be the remote-link host for Arcana, too, and Spree never complained about all the bandwidth that was eating up (1000+ fanfics hosted on Spree and remote-linked from Freeserve... fun for all the family to maintain). 
Z||000004||BlackDragon||06-25-2001||05:30 PM||blackfox71@yahoo.com||Well, thanks for the info anyway.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> freewebspace.net has quite the amount of free hosts listed. Not many support FrontPage however....oh well. Guess I just have to keep looking and hoping.

Z||000006||DolphinJoy||06-25-2001||06:23 PM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||I've been fighting against that site a while now, and the best thing we can honestly do is IGNORE IT.  DO NOT e-mail this site, in fact, DO NOT even look at it. All these sad, disgusting people want is attention..if they stop getting hits and e-mails, they will simply get bored.
Z||000007||Tazarr||06-25-2001||06:30 PM||hyprknuckles@aol.com||well..<IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well">My friend started a petition...if we reach 500 emails and send it to this US petition and what not site (cant remember name) They might shut it down!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> 
Z||000008||DolphinJoy||06-25-2001||06:43 PM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||Kool!  Hey, where is the petition? I'd like to sign!  Do i know your friend ( I know tonnes of Animal Rights activists online, we may have met...its a small web!)
Z||000009||GTK||06-26-2001||12:26 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Actually, I thought that site was kinda funny.. ^^; It is SO not true. Pokes fun at poodle-clippers and other people who make animals into what they like to see. 
Z||000010||Tazarr||06-26-2001||02:30 PM||hyprknuckles@aol.com||Okee...@_@ I feel like a fool...Tell me how you know it is fake...
Z||000011||DolphinJoy||06-26-2001||05:01 PM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||The worst part of that site is that it trivialises and promotes animal cruelty..and that cannot be funny.  <IMG SRC="smilie4.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="very mad">  How can we expect people to treat cats, dolphins or any other living creature with kindness and respect with this sort of attitude portrayed on the net?
Z||000012||GTK||06-27-2001||02:02 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||That's the whole point, you see! You read this Bonsai Kitten page and you feel completely sickened by it... it's supposed to make you think twice about animal cruelty and behaviour people claim isn't cruelty but useful or cool (like breeding broiler chickens so they grow so fast they can't walk, that sort of stuff). The last thing it does is promote it--you don't seriously think you could actually do that to a kitten? It wouldn't grow into a star-shape, trust me... As for knowing it's fake: read the "guestbook" entries. The exploding kitty one is particularly unbelievable. <p>Nah, this isn't a real site, it's just a hard-hitting joke. It's a little TOO real for most people, IMHO, but it IS a joke. One that speaks volumes about the way we respond to information on the Internet.

See:<p>http://ananova.com/news/story/sm_203667.html<br>and<br>http://netscape.zdnet.com/zdhelp/stories/main/0,5594,2692699,00.html<p>If you search for "Bonsai Kitten" in Google, the site itself appears under "Humor."<p>One of these says the US now has a law banning the "depiction of animal cruelty." :checks Congress' Web site: Yes, it's true. But if it's a *fake* depiction, it's nothing but free speech, and to outlaw it is unconstitutional even if it's sick humor. Petitions are the right way to handle this sort of thing, not laws.<p>We Americans always have trouble remembering that the First Amendment exists specifically to protect offensive speech.

Z||000020||yogoat||06-28-2001||09:37 PM||||I don't see what's wrong with using page builders...It's a faster way to do it, and if the site looks okay, then there's no problem...I don't use one, though; I program HTML.
Z||000021||BlackDragon||06-28-2001||10:12 PM||blackfox71@yahoo.com||The only reason I'm using a program is franky, that I'm tired of all the html, which I have used on my angelfire site since the begining. It takes so freakin' long to get things the way you want, and since I work full time, my free time is at a premium.<br>My website(s) are art based after all, I prefer having time to do the art rather than toy with the dang code. <IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well"><p>One last thing, I don't think that FrontPage sites look all that bad. My friend has an Anthro'/furry site on FurNation and her site looks cool, she uses the program. If your at all curious check it out sometime. She's a really good anime and furry artist. <p>http://www.furNation.com/Celesse     <br> <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
