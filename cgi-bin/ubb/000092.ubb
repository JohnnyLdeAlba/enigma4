But we don't really know much about your likes or dislikes since you don't really post that much.  as far as I'm concerned, you're quite welcome here.

Z||000003||The Entity||09-13-2000||06:43 AM||boblamont@mac.com||Well, you're all pretty nice. I'm not good at describing people, however.

You've kept the rules abd been good and made some interesting posts but I haven't really seen enough of you to comment...  try asking me again after you have made 100 or so posts and I might think of something to say...
