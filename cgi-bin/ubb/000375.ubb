You know what you should do to get your picture scanned?! Go somewhere, like KINKO'S (I think you have them where you live?), and you can use their computer and scanner! Make sure you bring a disk though, so you can save your scan to put it on your computer (you can buy the disks there too)! I went there before I got a scanner, and they were great about helping me! Hope you figure something out though!
