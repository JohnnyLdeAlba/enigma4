Sure it'll be a great system n'all...what with all it's capabilities...but it lacks the good strong game production ellement that requires a gaming company to thrive. So unless they land some great deal for games...all they'll have is an extremely strong system, with a few good games.<p>Sega though, has not teamed up with one company in particular. Heck, Sony has just picked up 7 of Sega's game titles to be release for the PlayStation2 (one of them being Ecco The Dolphin). It's been known that they're working with Nintendo as well...so I highly doubt the X-Box will be the system for the intended Dreamcast games...maybe a few...but from what I've read they'll be pretty much spread about. It's a shame...but...what can ya do?!
