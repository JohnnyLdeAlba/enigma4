He reduces their brains to mush, by crashing, Bsod'ing, deleting things and displaying really confusing messages which apparantly are errors but don't explain anything and much more...<p>However, he has yet to reduce me. Ha! I laugh in your face Bill, You shall not stop me! *MSIE crashes... AIM crashes... IRC crases... Explorer crashes... Control Alt Delete doesn't work...
