Don't believe me, hit the Game Developers Tutorial Central (For all you peeps looking for C++ programming), and with 6 months of http://www.gamedev.net you'll be churning out excellent games, like a few people I know.

I'm thinking about using Click and Create.  I was shoveling snow one day, and I had this great idea for maing jumping physics in click.
