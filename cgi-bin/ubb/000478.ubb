Z||000003||blackfin||12-11-2000||03:46 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||You can get the music off a pirated disk but it is in a format that there is no program to convert to mp3 or to play currentlly.  So the only way to make mp3's off all the tracks would be to record the music off a running game.

And it also features not all the music from the game.<p>So, the best bet is to record in game, not paused, and make sure there's no noise.

I've recorded music from the end credits, and from the levels 'Four Ways of Mystery', 'Passage From Genesis', 'Pathways to Nowhere', and 'Sleeping Forces of Doom'.  Fortunately the last two are short enough that I could record them with no interruption, on one breath of air.<br>However, the Atlantis theme at the end of the level 'Roaring Forces' (after the eel chases you) is too long to get in one breath, and you have to make noise getting air.  Currently I'm trying to splice some different takes together to get the whole song.<br>That's pretty much all the music you can get without the watery turbulence noise in the background.

I think sooner or later some hacker will write a program to either convert them into mp3's or to play them so I think that one day we will have a solution, it just may take time...
