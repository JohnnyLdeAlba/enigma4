I think that's a very big thing here, a story can't look good without commas, periods, and capital letters.  If you write your stories the way you type on the forum, you're screwed...But I haven't really seen you right much, so I can't really tell if you're good or not.  My suggestion is to go for it, I mean, why not?  I've been meaning to do a little writing myself, but I'm way too lazy.

My story got screwed cuz all the artistic italics, triple periods, and hyphon got lost when i sent it ti Blackie.
