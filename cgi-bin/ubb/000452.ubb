Z||000003||Eao||11-30-2000||08:08 AM||collprin@warwick.net||YEAH!  I've been checking the Vidio game music archives for them and noonw made any...pthhh they did sonic oness, psy prolly happy with them....but no Eccco-llalala.
Z||000004||Trace Kyshad||11-30-2000||08:31 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Well, Me being a Midi Composer, step out from the shadows here. I'd love to do one, really! (Makes a change from all those Sonic Mids I made/working on. However if it wants to be good, someone needs to find me an Mp3 of the track they want... That way I can get it close as I possible can.<p>And just for show, if anyone wants a sample of my work, check out<p><a href="http://redfireknux.homestead.com/files/lucidity.mid">Lucidity (Sonic Epoch : Fangame)</a><br><a href="http://redfireknux.homestead.com/files/music.mid">Tikal's Theme : SA (Not yet submitted to VGMusic.com) <a><br><a href="http://redfireknux.homestead.com/files/music/chao_remix.mid">Chao Theme Remix : SA (Submitted to VGmusic under the Alias Red XVI, EI Me)</a><br><a href="http://redfireknux.homestead.com/files/music/ekko.mid">Some strange attempt at a Remix of the theme from Ecco Jnr</a><p>You get me MP3, I get you Midi, trying to remember Mutaclone's theme while fighting or the ability not to pause and rewind is somewhat tricky... I've always like the small tune for Hanging Waters myself, and the intro music

I was sitting here listening to every one of those up there...like...<IMG SRC="smilie19.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="eek">! Man, I loved them all...they were totally awsome!!! I wish I could fool around with that stuff--midis! I have been playing the piano, since I can remmeber, and love to compose songs on it! I just wish I knew how to do all that "computer/midi" stuff...<IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">! Trace, would you happen to have any suggestions of literature I could possibly get my hands on, so I can read up on how midis work and are created??? I'd greatly appreciate it...oh goddess of midis!!!
Z||000006||dragonboy||11-30-2000||06:55 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||give me mp3s or digital any day.  midi's aren't as emotionally involving.  like the stairway to heaven on arkon's site is a very poor representation as to how it really sounds (i'm not busting on the site, i just like better sound qualities).  i know some of you like it out there so you should try to hear the orginal whenever you can.
Z||000007||dragonboy||11-30-2000||07:08 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i also wanted to add something.  now that you have much more free time black, you should now get those mp3s from dotf and post them up here. some of the trcaks have a natural ending, but some go on for a long time.  if they don't have a natural ending you should have about 5 minutes worth of track time for each. if you want i could time the music tracks to dotf and find the best ending time.<br>
Z||000008||Arkonviox||12-01-2000||02:18 AM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com|| <IMG SRC="http://arkonviox.com/artwork/faarkon.gif"> <br>midis are better for websites or did you not know that? mp3s would be imposible to use as music for anysite thats why i have them up they take one second and play great! do you have quicktime? oh yeah you dont have a computer...
Z||000009||blackfin||12-01-2000||03:28 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Dragonboy saying that I have "free time" is somewhat misleading in my case, I ALWAYS find so many projects to take on that I get my self rushed off my feet but I will attempt to work on the mp3's when I can.
Z||000010||XCrispy||12-01-2000||06:23 AM||xcrispy@ameritech.net||Those are amazing, Trace! Awesome! You are really good at what you do. What program(s) do you use to create your midis?<p>X-Crispy
Z||000011||Trace Kyshad||12-01-2000||08:07 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||I use Massiva, freeware and not brilliant, but no price, compared to that of CakeWalk or Noteworthey.<p>As for the whole Midis v MP3 thing, hmm. I've learnt much about Music on the internet. Whereas MP3's number in MegaBytes for size, you give a man a Yamaha Synth card and a Midi and you'll get CD Quality Midi files for less than a 10 Kb. MP3's are good for writing to CD's and occasionally soundtracks to games, but Midis are much more flexible, easy to write, and VERY powerful when composed by a master (Read : Not ME)<p>Recently, I found a collection of Midis specificly for Yamaha XG-100, D/led them, played them, and the quality was astounding. So much so I made MP3s of them, so hey!<p>Besides, instrumentals beat the original song 75% of the time anyway... and some Midis are actually better than the real thing (Dj Bobo's "Freedom" I can compare to)<p>Thanx for the positive comments
Z||000012||blackfin||12-01-2000||02:10 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I can give you any estimate of times yet Trace but I will have mp3's sooner or later for you...  I want more awesome midi's by you....
Z||000013||Delphi||12-01-2000||07:18 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Trace, if you could, you can go to the links page on this site, go to Tim Follin's place, that "Burial Site", and listen to the DOTF demos. They'd give you a good idea of how to do the tunes, and I would worship you as a God if you could do the "Lakesexcerpt" for everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!! <p><IMG SRC="smilie41.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rainbow"><br>And those midis are amazing, I totally agree with Dolphingirl!<br>COULD I USE THE ECCO JR. ONE ON MY SITE? I'll give you all the credit you want, and I'd be eternally grateful!!!
Z||000014||Delphi||12-01-2000||07:20 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Oh, crap. I just found that site doesn't work anymore...<p>*SIGH*<p>Or something...
Z||000015||blackfin||12-01-2000||10:27 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||eh? Tim Follin's website was working the last time I looked...
