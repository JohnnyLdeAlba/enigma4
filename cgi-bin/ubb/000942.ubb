A||||24||PsySonic||Arkonviox has the site, and I knew he would use it to get fresh power
Z||000000||PsySonic||06-30-2001||08:33 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||This site is handed to Arkonviox now for one day and I already see the results...<p>You plan on adding new sections, no matter if it will be Crestoe or you, or whether you will away for a long time, you are already planning on changing this place... And that sucks!<p>This place is Blackfin's place. He hands it to you and you make it Arkonviox' place. I have to ask, is this right? I can't believe it!<p>And I know it, Arkonviox main point in adding things to this site is to satisfy himself, his ego or whatever you call it. He has already considers that this is his place. And I already see Blackfin fading away more and more...<p>People, open your eyes and think about it. Don't you think so too? Don't you also recognize that all of BLACKFIN's work will sooner or later be forgotten? What I mean is, it is his stuff, he set this all up in the past year, and it belongs to himself. When Arkonviox and Crestoe and whoelse <i>*glares at Dolphingirl*</i> will update this site, it won't belong to Blackfin anymore.<p>Every new person who will visit this place won't see Blackfin anymore, and even if his name is still on the site, Arkonviox does the updates, Arkonviox is the webmaster, Arkonviox is webmaster of Blackfin's work and he will use it only for himself!<p>I know him very good, I know Arkon for nearly a year now, and I know he doesn't know what he does. He has no respect for Blackfin's work, he will only suck it up into himself to hear the people shout "wheeeewww this site is great - it's made by Arkonviox - He's the best".<p>And again, I see you have forgotten Blackfin already.<p>Don't you all think so too: It would have been the best if this site stays as it is, with no new webmaster?<p>I would never have taken Blackfin's site, cause I knew what I would do to him, but Arkonviox doesn't respect it.<p>People, open your eyes! This place is Blackfin's, it should never belong to somebody else!<p>Even if you still think now "I will never forget Blackfin, cause he did all this", in some weeks he will be forgotten, and every new visitor won't even recognize who he is.<p>Is this right? I want to ask you - Do you really want this place this way?<p><i>P.S.: And no, it's not only because I'm sad about this, THIS IS FACT! Arkonviox, this is my point of view, my FULL point of view, and take it as CREDIT! I know this might turn into a fight, but then it is at least for a good thing, a fight for Blackfin's work!</i>

And I am on your side of things here *no, I'm NOT taking sides, just using a form of speech*<p>I still will harm Arkon ALOT if he changes the site too much, we like it as it is, sure, add a FEW secons and keeps updating with fan things, or news about Ecco or something.<p>But I really don't want the site to change.<p>~.~<p>The dolphin still depressed about Blackfin leaving, Whitefin
Z||000002||Whitefin Dolphinius||06-30-2001||10:09 AM||loutus_leopard@hotmail.com||*clears throat* <p>Arkons topics give the power thing away, just by the names.<p>The new webmaster and owner of The Undercaves...  ~ The Undercaves<p>I'm the new webmaster at The Undercaves....Creepy, huh? ~Arkonviox.Com<p> <IMG SRC="mad.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="mad">  <IMG SRC="smilie3.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="mad">  <IMG SRC="smilie4.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="very mad"> 
Z||000003||Crestoe||06-30-2001||11:34 AM||crestoe@arkonviox.com||You have both been clouded by ignorance, Arkon did not take this site because he wanted the power of it, it was handed to him by blackfin himself! And wether you'd liek to admit it, there is nothing you can do and Arkon is not giving up so easily, he hasnt even done anthing yer you stupid mother f<a>uckers!<p>I am sick of you ppl thinking that Arkon is here to ruin yourlives, this site is just DHTML, JAVA, and PERL you sh<a>it heads! CHILL!!<p>It aint real life so aint sh<a>it going to happen!  
Z||000004||PsySonic||06-30-2001||12:06 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||Blackfin didn't know about the actual situation, since he has hardly been here. He didn't know that it would turn out this way! That is why he handed it to Arkonviox.<p>And I'm pointing out that this site is too worthy for anyone to take. I hope Arkonviox will recognize this and leave this site alone again, but he won't do it, cause now he has the source of Ecco fans and can rule them all. That is the thing he never was able to do, cause there never came any worthy newbies to his website and i guess that pissed him off! Now he has control over every Ecco fan and he enjoys it, he is so selfish! That is the fact and it makes me sick to think about it Crestoe! Believe it or not, that is the way it is, and if you are on his side you are as bad as him! He gets sugar pushed into his *** and you support it, it makes me so sick!
Z||000005||Histronic||06-30-2001||01:12 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||It is a very shocking thing that this happened, i must agree.  We DO have to preserve blackfin's work, and just because Arkonviox owns this place and plastered his name all around doesn't mean he doesn't want to do it.  If I were Arkon, I would sign all of the pages Blackfin did "blackfin" and all of the pages Arkon did "Arkonviox".  Then, you could all get along happily knowing that blackfin is still going to be known, Arkonvox and Crestoe will be happy to have a site for their game AND a general ecco site as well, and I can be happy because we can boot the g rating!  I was one of the people blackfin personally sent email to, and he seems to be sad he has to leave, NOT because Arkonviox owns his site!
Z||000006||GTK||06-30-2001||01:14 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||*holds hands up in a pacifying gesture* <p>I'm not getting involved in any fights between Arkonviox, Crestoe or anyone else. But I would like to mention that I agree to some degree with Psy's comments... and I know that several people are already unhappy with the state of affairs. The Undercaves should, quite simply, stay as they are, if only because this was blackfin's site in the first place. 
Z||000007||yogoat||06-30-2001||01:50 PM||||What's the harm in adding a few more sections? If he leaves the layout the same but just adds some stuff, then it'll just be fore the better...I don't see how adding a poetry section would hurt anything, I bet blackfin would've gotten around to it sooner or later.  You guys must just hate arkon or something; there's no need to be this pissed off about things...
Z||000008||GTK||06-30-2001||02:26 PM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Eh, I've nothing against Arkon. And it's not that there will be new sections... it's the possibility that blackfin's hand in this site will be entirely extinguished. I certainly wouldn't want to see major changes to layout or anything. If Arkon can stick to what you suggested, yogoat, 's'all good ^_^ 
Z||000009||DolphinJoy||06-30-2001||03:11 PM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||We're all upset about Blackfin leaving...but there's no reason to take it out on Arkon.  Blackfin wouldn't have left him in charge if he didn't trust him.
Z||000010||PsySonic||06-30-2001||03:14 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||Good point, Joy. But it still doesn't change the facts I described up there... <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">
Z||000011||yogoat||06-30-2001||04:51 PM||||Yeah, I'm pretty sure he'll just so what I said...if not, then it's time for yogoat to create an ecco website...
Z||000012||Histronic||06-30-2001||08:29 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Just because this place is under new government doesn't mean you have to leave!  You people are way too sensitive.
Z||000013||Arkonviox||06-30-2001||09:07 PM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com||The only reason i will be adding to it is to make myself more at home Arkonviox.com will have things this site wont and this site will have things arkonviox.com doesnt....<p>I will trie to credit as much as possible to blackfin like copyrights and walkthroughs and stuff....I was thiking of a page dedicated to blackfin and even a good history to this website so people can understand what where all about here...<p>The honest truth is if you got a finished project such as this site you dont let it die in the dust and blackfin out of more people rather see his work continue to evolve especialy since people come here more over arkonviox.com and especialy since this place is a success...i will be marly adding onto it and making some fixes but not anything to change the look even i will trie to preserve the feel....<p>Talk all you want or even whine i do rule the intire ecco community for now and underline the for now part cause i want one of you to try to create the success of the MAJOR TWO and see if you can out do there succcess...your right psy there isnt anywhere for people to go but i will give all those who i hate and such a second chance...just know that i rule this site ...you are welcome to express how you feel as long as you dont make anyone mad psy you have been making me mad but noticing its your opinion your free to exress that but take note that i dont want you to rub it so much in my face how much you think i suck cause qiet frankly im tired of hearing it
Z||000014||dolphingirl||06-30-2001||10:59 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||My goodness!?!?! What the heck happened in here?!? <i>*sighs*</i> First off, Sonic...I didn't think my friendship with Arkon would jeopardize ours! You obviously don't agree with something I'm doing. But who are you to judge how I feel about the whole matter...!? You don't know how I feel about blackfin leaving...not one bit!!! I'm terribly upset about it...he was such a near and dear friend to me! But what can you do...mope around, whine about it...what will that accomplish!? Nothing...it can't bring him back. He's made it clear he's not coming back. As much as I would like to change that...I cannot! I spoke to him the night he made the decision to leave...in chat. It was him, Arkonviox, and I...and I was able to see what went on. If only you all knew Arkon's true feelings about the matter. <i>*shakes her head*</i> And he shouldn't have to spill them to everyone either...but geesh...how little credit you give him!?!<p>PsySonic...do you honestly believe blackfin didn't know what he was doing when he gave the site to Arkonviox?!? I mean really...c'mon!?! Blackie's a smart guy...he knew exactly what might happen. I saw for myself, blackfin telling Arkon that it was his now...and to do with it what he wished. Blackfin created this masterpiece...and no one will forget that...I know I won't, and will do everything in my power to see that it's not forgotten. I think yogoat's suggestion is a really good one...and I wouldn't be surprised if Arkon already had that in mind. Heck...his idea about a whole page explaning all this...is a marvelous idea! I hope he does it too! I think blackie deserves to be recognized as such!<p>There's so much I wish I could say about Arkon...and the way things were when blackie handed the site over to him...<i>*sighs*</i>...but it's not my place to do so. If you guys would just stop bickering, and just give him a chance, Arkon really isn't about messing up this great site at all! I don't feel there's anything more I can say...but...Sonic, please...as your friend...don't be mad at me for the other friends I've got. I would never do the same to you.<p>Please guys...lets not keep this an on-going fight like it seems to be turning out to be... <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> ...for blackie's sake...pleeeease?!
Z||000015||Crestoe||07-01-2001||03:47 AM||crestoe@arkonviox.com||Alls you had to do is shut your loud, gay fu<a>cking mouth Psy!<p>But now i got beef with you vory son-of-a-bit<a>ch! Take this as advice my friendless friend who i am not friends with at all: Get a real life you f<a>uck!<p>Dont like what i said, i dont like this sh<a>it you say either, punk!<br>Now thi  ****  is broken and you cant do nothin to fix it. You had to bi<a>tch about the whole thing! No wonder alotta ppl think you suck! <p>Oh sure, you may be on everyones side like you think you are, but you havent changed obne little bit: Your still a snibbeling spineless coward!<p>And ofcourse im on arkons side, you dont realize that this site WOULD die with no webmaster but your brainless a<a>ss says it can! Man are you hella dumb!
Z||000016||Eao||07-02-2001||09:56 AM||collprin@warwick.net||uhhhhhh...........Black is gone from the cyber world and need to re-assemble his life...after turblent thngs..........he mentioned the megz situation, and all hell broke loose, so i guess he's joiing the real world and get more cracking on his schol work and stuff.<p>withoout somone here it wold become one of those pages......that las had an update 2 yrs ago........*shudders*
Z||000017||Delphi||07-02-2001||12:35 PM||sailor_delphi13@hotmail.com||KNOW THIS:<p>By anything I now say I don't wanna start another  *****  fight.<p>Now...<p>I'm sorry, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. If Blackfin gave the site up, then oh well! Who is everyone else to say what he should and shouldn't have done with HIS site? <p>Arkon now has what he wanted in the first place, and he has it with Blackfin's blessing. I sat let him go ahead. This place hasn't had any real action in a while, I think, so I wouldn't complain about anyone sprucing it up.<p>When I stop to think about it, and realize that I've been coming to this site for about a year now, and actually think about all the  ****  that went on here, I'm kind of amazed that this place is still up. <p>So whatever. Whatever goes on is none of my business, I'm sure. <p>But uh... people? Maybe realize that this is a website, like Crestoe (was it?) said, and not real life. Stop fighting about this stupid  **** . Stress kills.<p>(shrugs and walks off)
Z||000018||PsySonic||07-02-2001||02:41 PM||psysonic@t-online.de||Yeah, Delphi, you are quite right there...<p>I'm sorry guys, sorry for shouting at everybody, but you are all right. I guess I took this place too serious, my real life is not very well at all. So, yeah, Crestoe, you are right and even by shouting at me you said it in a way quite correctly.<p>I dunno, I actually sweared that I never wanted to take any sides, but I somehow supported Blackfin even more before he left, talked with him about the actual situation and went a little Anti-Arkon again. That was just because I went so mad when Blackfin left.<p>Well, I realized that I really also have to sort out things in my real life, but I won't leave you guys. And I want to say I'm sorry about all of what I've said in the past days, I took that way too serious! Let's all take it as a warning what can happen when you take the internet too serious!<p>But I guess that I'm not the only one here who has to think about his personal sitution in this community, huh? Otherwise the situation wouldn't be so extreme...<p>So, sorry, Arkon, Crestoe, Dolphingirl and the rest I've hurt so bad, I will stop complaining about that whole thing. This place shall be about Ecco, and not about our stupid lifeless ourselves, huh?<p>Hope you understand me. That's about it, I guess another pointless fight shall be stopped now.
Z||000019||dolphingirl||07-03-2001||04:24 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||<i>*hugs her friend Sonic*</i><p>That took extreme courage to stand up and say what you just said there, PsySonic...<IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well">...I know it couldn't have been easy. I understand why you did what you did...and I don't hold it against you in the least bit. I'm very stressed out that blackfin left us...but over time, I've found that when something stresses you out like this, the best thing is to get it off your mind before something happens you wish hadn't. Case in point. I'm sorry things here are the way they are...for if I had it my way...blackie would still be here, posting his usual posts. But, what can ya do...nothing...it's not in our hands now...it's in Arkons, and was placed there by blackfin himself. I just hope his memory will live on in this site...till he returns once again... <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"> <p>Hope to see ya around in chat sometime, Sonic... <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

Z||000021||Vortex of time||07-03-2001||09:42 PM||eaglestar211@aol.com||I see what your saying Psy, but i also see Arkonviox's point. Hes not out here for power, hes just trying to 'expand'. I just hope all of Blackys work doesnt get ersed, since he worked so hard to get it like this
