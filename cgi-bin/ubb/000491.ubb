A||||6||Debaser13||Just need a few suggestions....
Z||000000||Debaser13||12-12-2000||10:14 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||O.K, I'm sure everyone knows about my old site; that great hulking wreck of Geocities save space, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter. Well, I'm moving, kinda, and I'd just like to hear what all you good good people think of the new page so far. So here it is, my plug *of sorts* :<p>www.geocities.com/tonberryhill<p>Could some of you just take a look and tell me what you think? I want it to be better than the last, you see, and feedback is BEGGED for.<p>And one more thing : Fanfics. I take all kinds of fanfics, so if you've got an Ecco work in progress, read over my guidelines and send it in. Plleeeaaase.
