A||||1||Reptyx||Starting on another part of Hanging Waters
Z||000000||Reptyx||09-03-2000||11:27 AM||reptyx@hotmail.com||Some time ago I asked if there was a way to start on part 2 of Hanging Waters without beating Ice and Fire again, and both SilverFin and blackfin said you couldn't. Well anyway, I beat Hanging Waters and the game too, eventually. Now if I beat Abyss of Inferno, quit the game on Hanging Waters, then start the game again and select Continue Game I come directly to part 3 of Hanging Waters! (bleah! about time now! ^_^)<p>I couldn't use Continue Game after I had come to Dolphin World Championship until I beaten the game, because I would always be taken back to DWC. Has this happened to anyone else?
