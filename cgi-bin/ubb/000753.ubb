As you might know, I also own a site ( <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup"> spam attack <IMG SRC="smilie25.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="freak"> :  <A HREF="http://www.sonicspeedway.de.vu" TARGET=_blank>http://www.sonicspeedway.de.vu</A> ) and when I started with website building I taught it all by myself with a handy program called "HomeSite". You can download it here, it's FREEWARE <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">  <A HREF="http://saturn.spaceports.com/~hauke/progs/homesite.exe" TARGET=_blank>http://saturn.spaceports.com/~hauke/progs/homesite.exe</A> . Fool around with it. It's got many buttons whom you can add tables and frames and all that stuff with. It's very easy. It's even got a "start up" button you can make the first step for your site with <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> I also started with that program - it's very nice and cool and I use it till today!
