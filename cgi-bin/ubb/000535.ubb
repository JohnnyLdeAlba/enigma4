I wanted to find maybe Knux or Tails, but I couldn't... *sigh*<p>I had some good Sonic stuff... let me see *rummages through her memory* erm... I had... Sonic 2,3, 3D Blast and Knuckles for Sega, Sonic one and two for Game Gear, a HUGE pile of those shitty Archie Sonic comics, the McDonald's toys, some Sonic thingie that had gum in his head, and a Game Gear shaped gum holder thing that had AWESOME gum in it plus these li'l hint cards for the Sonic games for Game Gear. And I loved it all. <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">
