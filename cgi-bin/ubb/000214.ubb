Z||000000||Debaser13||10-11-2000||02:06 PM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||I've just learned there there is not only one wolf sim game out there for the PC -- but TWO. And to make a long story short, I NEED THESE GAMES. I've wanted to play a wolf sim since I was small *no joke* so this is a dream come true.<Br> <br> Sadly though, every link I go to seems to be broken or sold out of the games. So if anyone would have any information about how to buy or locate the PC games "Wolf" or "Fading Footsteps" I'd be eternally in your debt. Thank you. <Br>

Go on www.ebay.com and click on search and go to number search. The number is 460825366. It said on the descrition "a wolf interactive game". I hope that is the right one.
Z||000003||Debaser13||10-11-2000||04:45 PM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||Yeah, I found "Wolf" on Ebay for like six bucks. I'm most definitely getting it, and thanks for the help. If you see "Fading Footsteps" could you alert me too ? Thanks.<Br>
Z||000004||Coral||10-11-2000||04:52 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Your welcome. I'm still looking for Fading Footsteps.
Z||000005||Coral||10-11-2000||08:37 PM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  You're in luck, Debaser13!!!! I found it!!! Go to http://www.defenders.org/giftshop.html <br>I hope that helps.
Z||000006||Debaser13||10-12-2000||03:11 AM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||Thanks, Coral, but..........the link they've got dosn't seem to be working.....hmm.<Br> <Br> Ahh well. I'll just get that nice cheap copy of <i> Wolf </i>. It's more than I ever expected to find anyway....<Br>
Z||000007||Coral||10-12-2000||06:11 AM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  That's strange. The link works for me. Maybe you typed it wrong or something. Anyway, I went to that website and clicked on Fading Footsteps and it brought me to some online store. I'll keep looking, ok?
Z||000008||Debaser13||10-12-2000||02:22 PM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||Hmmmmmmmmmmm.......Just put the link you used up here and I'll try it again, eh ? <Br> <Br> And have you played FF7 yet ? <Br>
