It really sucks for those who can't just go out and buy the system it comes out for--like most of us! If it comes out on PS2 I'm covered (or any other previously released console)...but I wonder if it'll be released for one of the new ones commin out here in the near future, such as the Gamecube or X-Box. What a shame...what a shame...it can't just be one of the games that Sega releases in the next 18 months...huh!<IMG SRC="ohwell.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="oh well">

I really hate THIS happening! I can't even be glad about that there will come another game cause I will have to wait for the new console being cheap enough for me to buy it! Couldn't SEGA at least bring out the next Ecco game on the DC? Why did I buy this console? Only for one Ecco game and probably two Sonic games? I really hate that happening. And what if SEGA decides to bring out Sonic and Ecco games on different consoles? I couldn't buy them all... This all really sucks ass!!!

Don't you think so too? Not even bad enough that SEGA stopped production of the DC, now it even stops the Ecco sequel on it! Please write what you think about it! Blackfin, couldn't you just make an announcement somewhere on your site so every Ecco fan who visits your site could just be informed (email addresses of Appaloosa and SEGA) how he can help trying to make SEGA produce another Ecco game on the DC? I know there might be a small chance of winning but as real Ecco fans we have to at least TRY! That is our DUTY!

I WANT MY FU**ING MONEY BACK, SEGA, IF YOU ARE READING THIS!!  I'll sick my terminator on you!
