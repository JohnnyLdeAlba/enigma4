Z||000000||That guy with the hat||09-15-2000||08:21 PM||thatguywiththehat@hotmail.com||I bought the Versus strategy guide for Ecco the dolphin DOTF. I bought it to help me find the Vitalits I was still missing. I had seen it before and saw that they pointed out where the vitalits are on maps so I bought it after I beat the game. I am disappointed. They point out the GENERAL location, but are incresingly vague as to their exact locations. Example: Hatchery: The map shows an inaccurate picture of the eggs, points to one and says, "Inside an empty egg here.". They say zilch about your needing to use the power of sonar to lift the egg and opening it. Also, they don't mark enemies or other dolphins on their maps. They say they have "insanely detailed maps", but that is a lie, they're just kinda' colored in. And they don't have a map for hanging waters(my favorite level), they said it would be too hard. As a result they have to just try to describe what to do and where vitalits are as best they can and because of that I am still missing just the one vitalit in Hanging Waters and they're so vague I don't know where the blazes it is! The format is cumbersome and redundant nd it has definetely bagged more than its limit in typos and in task description they sometimes don't go into much detail. Its not good.<br>Could somebody help me with these Hanging Waters Vitalits.
