I have found most of them in just about every level except for 2. I know its sad, but it's true. By the way Hanging Waters is the best level in any game ever created. Part 3 is the best. I am very happy, but I want those vitalits! I want them now. I also want a sequel I want it now!<p>P.S. I ate sugarcubes for breakfast. Yum!
