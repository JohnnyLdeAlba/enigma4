Z||000007||dragonboy||10-31-2000||09:25 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||alright, i must admit to everyone.  I watch pokemon.  So what, it gives me another show to watch saturday mornings, and its interesting at times.  Although i did like the first couple of seasons the best.  I like charmander the most because he looks like my pets. <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> It would be fun if they communicated with me as well as he did.  charizard and charmeleon are Dragonite too.

Z||000010||blackfin||11-01-2000||01:45 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've watched pokemon a bit (mainly to see what all the craze is about) and I did play the game a while ago, but I'm not really into it.
Z||000011||dragonboy||11-01-2000||01:57 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||no, not crazy.  i just like to watch it.  I think the show has an appeal to me cuz i love animals, and it would be nice if they animals i talk to, would talk back in some way as well, other than just squaks, barks, etc.
Z||000012||Coral||11-01-2000||03:58 PM||ntraver@epix.net||  <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  My favorite Pokemon are Flareon, Vaporeon, Zapdos, Articuno, Jolteon, and Mewtwo. Those are the pokemon that I raise to fight. I have never lost a battle. Although, I'm not pokemon crazy, I am Jolteon crazy. The reason why I like pokemon is because I rock at it!
Z||000013||Charisma||11-01-2000||06:01 PM||kailin79@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcharisma.gif"> <br>That's an understatement. I'm not really into Pokemon I just like some of the characters. I happen to like Digimon. And, of course, DBZ.<br>
