A||||3||SnowFox102||I need help in Seeds of Poison!
Z||000000||SnowFox102||09-26-2000||08:47 AM||snowfox102@cs.com||I'm stuck in Seeds of Poison! I used the Power of Sonar on all the eggs stuck in the tunnel, but I can't figure out what to do next! I tried using the Power of Sonar on the sheilded eggs that fall down occasionaly, but that doesn't do anything! Help!
