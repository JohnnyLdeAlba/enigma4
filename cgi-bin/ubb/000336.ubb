Up top is kirby, my iguana, laying in his food (cute guy)  and below is walter, my water dragon, sleeping on kirby's tail.  they never fight, except kirby chases walter away if he gets too close to his food <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

Z||000013||dragonboy||11-01-2000||01:53 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||they each have their own separate cages. but on weekends, or when i'm around a long time, i take off the cage doors and let them run around the room.  walter likes kirby's cage more cuz its bigger.  (by the way this pic is a little oldm, i completely remodeled it 3 months ago)
