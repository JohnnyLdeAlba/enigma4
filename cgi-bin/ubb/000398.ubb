Z||000003||Trace Kyshad||11-19-2000||05:53 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Well, when I got Photoshop, it came with a twin package called Adobe ImageReady, which speciallises in Gif Animation. It's pretty much Photoshop for Gifs, which is a handy thing ^^ I was thinking of doing some animations, but animation ain't an easy thing. Things like Lens Flares and Such are quite easy to do, along with things for webpages like Overlays, buttons, slices, rollovers, etc.<p>Thanks, glad you like it, and hope her does
