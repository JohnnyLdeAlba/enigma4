Lots and lots of them. But if you try to sing to them, they just ignore you. In fact, they never even adknowledge that you're there. Odd, eh ? <Br> <Br> I wonder why the programmers put them in...? Personally it just made me more depressed to see a happy pod of dolphins when poor Ecco's was lost.<Br> <Br> Ahh well. Just something strange to look for. Did anyone else notice them ? I always liked to think that maybe they were just.....happy memories of Ecco's own pod or something.What's your theory ? <Br>

Z||000002||Debaser13||10-09-2000||10:25 AM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||Yeah, and that gives me an idea for a fanfic.......<br> <br> *Plots* <br> <Br> A ghost pod, anyone ? <Br>
Z||000003||Coral||10-09-2000||10:29 AM||ntraver@epix.net|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fcoral.gif">  Yeah!! At least add something to that fan fic section. I might write something to if I have time.
Z||000004||Debaser13||10-09-2000||10:54 AM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||I plan to write more chapters for "The Happening" if I ever get time, but this plot intrigues me. I think I'll go work on it right now....  there is WAY too little Ecco fanfiction ; there needs to be mucho more.<Br>

Oh, damn them, then! I love to talk to other dolphins... <p>I think maybe the programmers put them in becuase they just wanted to fill the level with critters. They don't have anything important to say.<p>I also jump with them, Coral. It's fun!<p>Fanfic away!!!
