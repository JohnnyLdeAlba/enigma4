Z||000003||Trace Kyshad||11-07-2000||05:37 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Thanks all, finding all the vitalis should be fun (ARG!) but at least I finished it, worst comes to the worst I could always sneak a peak at a walkthrough ^^

They couldn't be <i>more</i> vague about some of them! Anyway...good luck!

Z||000006||Histronic||11-12-2000||10:31 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Those vitalits are hard to find.  The only one I have left to find is one in Master of Forgotten Skills.  The walkthrough is wrong, I think.  Could anyone give me a guide to that level?<p>I used a walkthrough for the game, though.  My resolution is to never use a walkthrough in Ecco 2, except to get vitalits. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000007||Ecco The Dolphin||11-13-2000||09:17 PM||eccodolphin@hotmail.com||Yes, I've found that walkthroughs can seriously detract from any surprise in a game, making it more of a chore to play.<p>Good job on fnishing Ecco!  Now the hard part, finding the vitalits....
Z||000008||Histronic||11-14-2000||07:50 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiture.gif"> Oh, I found it!  I found the last vitalit inside the tunnel you enter the level through!  Now I continue on through the game to... Process that never ends.  I still need to get a vitalit for that level, I can't find it because the guide is WRONG again...
Z||000009||dolphingirl||11-14-2000||04:22 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fdolphingirl.gif">  Horay! Good job Histronic! Now, for that vitalit in Process that never ends...I bet I know which one you're missing! It's probably in the tall, cylindrical room where the two lasers are zapping those rocks! You need to go to the floor, swim around the bottom till you see a crack in the glass, go through it, and you'll find it near the ground! Hope that's the one you're missing, if not...let me know! <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000010||Histronic||11-14-2000||06:39 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||I think I got that one already.  I got the ones in the fourth and fifth air chambers, one near the tunnel, and one in th cylendar room, but I'm not sure I swam through glass to get it.
Z||000011||dolphingirl||11-14-2000||08:31 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fdolphingirl.gif">  Ok! Yeah, well there is two vitalits in that cylindrical room! One is just under the conveyor, by those tube like structures, then the other is farther down. It looks like you cant go any lower, but you can through the crack in the glass! Hope that helps?! <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">
