That means I don't always see people when they first log in, but I am there!  If you would just wait a few minutes i will check the chat room and will notice you so please don't just log on try to talk then Get no response and log off again, if you wait I will respond in a few minutes when i notice you are there...  Please don't log off link that..  I have missed to many people that way...

Z||000004||blackfin||09-14-2000||05:50 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Thank you,  It was getting very frustrating just seeing that people had joined and left just a few seconds before you checked back to see if there was anybody in the chatroom...  Especial when they were people you especially wanted to talk to...  Plus the fact that the time difference makes me miss a huge number of people when they are on...  It was getting very frustrating...

Z||000007||Archcomet||10-03-2000||09:35 PM||archcomet@hotmail.com||I do that also, I just leave mirc up almost all the time, but if you scroll up so that when a new msg appears it's below where you can see it mirc does a system beep, that's how I've been catching ppl.
