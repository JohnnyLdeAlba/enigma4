Suddenly, he noticed an EXTREMELY odd Jelly Belly. It was mauve with neon green spots and a glowing white interior. Gali wasn't the kind of mask to look a gift Jelly Belly in the mouth, so he ate it and was immediately transported to Princess Fishy-Poofle's castle.

Miss Fishie said, "my stomach hurts" so she took knives and stabbed her stomach eighteen times with a butter knife until--EDITED OUT FOR THE LITTLE KIDDIES--.  "That stupid gali retard @#$% @#^$ @#$^ #@!#$ !#$^ gave me indigestion the brat" Fishie said as cows stampeded through her room where she mysteriously was after fishes swam back and forth suddenly she was in water with lightning in it electricuting everything so they all were fried then yogoat came down and ate them all but they regenerated in his stomach so he blew up and they swam around. <p>Next?  (Yes, it's 10:30 and bored as the place down under)

He then entered a portal back to the Monster Rancher world and vowed never to eat a Jelly Belly like that one again.
