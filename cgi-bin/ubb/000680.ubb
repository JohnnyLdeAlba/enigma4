Everyone with PSO post your character's name, level, ship, and block. Then well start the unstoppable team "Ecco"!!!<p>I'll go first<br>Gustaff<br>Lv. 22<br>Arith<br>Blk-1

But I don't have it either and it's too expensive for me to connect to the Internet with the Dreamcast here in Germany so I let it be...

Lot's of people have told me to get it...and I'm actually considering it. So, Gustaff, as of right now I don't have the game...but if I do end up getting it...I will have to let you know!
