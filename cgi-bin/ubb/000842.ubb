You know how you can go directly to the time machine and all that...But there's a passageway to the right of the 'passport' glyph. I've explored the remainder of the level here, and it's a whole lot of...nothing.  <IMG SRC="smilie3.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="mad"> Nothing meaning jellyfish, pointy crystals, currents, statues, more of the same Atlantis theme. I honestly don't know what this part of the level is supposed to be...It just looks like they threw some stuff in here either to confuse you, or to fill in the empty space... <IMG SRC="raiseeyebrows.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="raise eye brows"> <br>Nevertheless, I'd like to know if anyone has any clue as to what this all means. Seeing as how I'm trying to work out FinTex's background, and I've decided her pod resides in Atlantis, I'd like to know if there's some secret level in City of Forever or something. (Speaking of FinTex's background, who likes the music in 'Pteranodon Pond' and the other prehistoric levels? I'm making it her theme music. <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge">)
