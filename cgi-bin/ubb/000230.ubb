When you go to get the dolphins some fish what the hell is that big fish doing there?!!?  it's even on the title picture of the level, so I think it's gotta be for something.  Even in a walkthough it said get the Power of Stealth and swim into the fish"s mouth!  That fish is really annoying me and i want to know its puprpose.  I also figured out a funny name for the fish~Spew!  It eats all the other fish then it looks like it"s barfing the other fishes out!<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>"Laugh, and the world laughs with you!  Cry, and you get wet.
