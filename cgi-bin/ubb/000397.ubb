Z||000015||Coral||11-23-2000||09:10 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Ooooo I can't stand animal cruelty! Let me tell you 2 stories about animal cruelty that happened over where I live.<p>My mom's friend owns a stable where people board their horses. I came over for the first time and she got a new horse there. His name was Chance. His original owner starved him almost to death and somebody else bought Chance and took him to the stables. He was a bag of bones but I fell in love with that horse. I would beg my mom to take me there to visit him and give him apples and stuff like that. After visiting for a few days, I found out that Andrea (the person that took Chance from the farmer) wasn't paying board. She owed Kim (the stable owner) $500! I offered to buy him but she wouldn't sell him. Kim told her that she needed to get Chance's bloodwork done but she refused. After weeks of working for money to buy Chance he started to get sick. 2 weeks later he died. He collapsed in the barn and wouldn't get up so they had to put him to sleep. Chance was foaming at the mouth for a few days before he died so they had to remove his head for testing. I doubt he had rabis! After all that, Andrea said he would get a proper burial. Well, her and her boyfriend dumped his body on the side of the road! We think that he had diabetes or something like that but Andrea wouldn't get his bloodwork done. We could have saved him if she did.<p>An animal shelter manager was abusing the animals in the shelter and me, my mom, and some other people were fighting to get her out of there!<br>We finally got her out but I'll tell you some of the things she did to the dogs and cats there.<br>She would lock dogs in her basement and never clean up after them or let them out. She wouldn't feed them either!<br>As soon as a new dog came, she would most likely kill it.<br>When you ask if your lost dog is there, she would say "No there is no golden retriever here. Sorry." even though there is and she would kill it.<br>There are so many things she did but I don't want to say anymore.<br>

It's a shame that most people just shove off their relatives like an old shirt.  Maybe if these cruel people get placed themselves in a home, they would learn how to treat others.  Too bad it would be too late for many people.

That's so very sad, Coral. But I think Pharph (i'll call you that for short...<IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">) has a very very good point. His subject almost hits too close to home (my grandmother recently died in one of those damn homes), which is sad to have to say. Pharph, that was good to point that out, since I'm sure that not many would have. Anyway...

Z||000029||dragonboy||11-27-2000||12:13 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||i'm so sorry to hear about that coral, both the horse and that bitch animal shelter lady.  if our dog ran away and was killed by her, i'd would beat the living shit out of her nonstop every day until she was nothing more than soggy pile of flesh.  excuse the anger, but what she is doing is flat ouyt wrong, and to treat a horse like that, letr alone any other other animal, just is too sad to even think about.  I used to treat animals bad when i was about 8 years old.  i had a real god-complex, like i was superior or something.  i'l never forget some of the bad things i've done.  maybe because of my past actions, i am now such a strong advocate of animal rights and i love them so deeply, even the mean ones.  but i can never forgive myself for some of the stupid things i've done in childhood
Z||000030||Debaser13||11-27-2000||01:06 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Animal cruelty makes me feel worse than human abuse. Animals can't speak out when they're being mistreated, and it kills me to see it. <p>Did you hear about those guys who broke into that cat sanctuary a few years back and beat like twenty of the poor kitties to death? Freaking <B> BASTARDS</B>. I hope they all get used as girlfriend bait in prison.<p>Nothing, <i> nothing </i> makes me as mad as animal abuse. Nursing homes just make me sad; I can't stand to go inside them. All those poor old people locked up like animals themselves....yikes.

I think you guys should start with a "New Topic" to continue this animal/human cruelty. Pleeeeaaase, the next person who wants to comment on that subject...could you start a "New Topic"...perhaps "...Continuing on the animal cruelty subject..."? And in no way am I criticizing this subject either...I just think it'd be more appropriate to continue the discussion on a thread of messages of their own...<i>*dolphingirl is just trying to prevent something...*</i>
