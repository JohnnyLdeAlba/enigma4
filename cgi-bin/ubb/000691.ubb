I have stumbled into the games room and now cannot beat "The Clan"  at Dolphin World Championship football. Does anyone know how to get out of this game to get back to the normal level 21 because there is no way to win this game of football in a lifetime.

The game is found in the room where the inspector dolphin is. Behind the wobbly wall is the power of stealth. At the back of the room on the floor are two large orange pads,touch the right hand one and you are thrown into the game.

I loved that thing, hammered that Clan guy to oblivion, and that ball kept flying off any direction <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>To get there, it's the level POwers of Levitation. Go to the room with the inspector Clan Member, a round room with an air supply in the centre. Simply search for a wall that looks out of place. You can go through it! Grab the Invisibilty and swim toward an orange glowy part of the floor (I forget where it is, somewhere in the room)<p>And you're there... I think
