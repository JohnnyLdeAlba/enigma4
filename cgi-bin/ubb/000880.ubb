Z||000003||death fin||06-15-2001||11:53 AM||bradley5@yadtel.net||radio head rocks
Z||000004||Debaser13||06-15-2001||02:59 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Yep. I'm a huge fan. Got all of their albums except Pablo Honey, and my BF has that one.<p>I personally like "You And Whose Army?" better than "I Might Be Wrong," but that's just me.<p>Did anyone else happen to think that the video for "Pyramid Song" looked an awful lot liek the "Man's Nightmare" level in DOTF? The greenish water, I think. Quite interesting...<br>
Z||000005||yogoat||06-15-2001||07:38 PM||||Deathfin, really, how old are you?  It's just in total question...<p>And base, I've never thought about that...I just thought the Pyramid Song video was a sunken city, and that was it...nothing like Man's Future, but that's probably just my ignorant way of looking at things =)  I'd have to say, though, my favorite song would be "Talkshow host" or "Idioteque".
