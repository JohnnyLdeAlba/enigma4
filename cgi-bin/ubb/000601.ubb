Z||000000||Histronic||01-20-2001||10:45 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard.gif"> I was looking around the archived media at ign.com, and I noticed a few thingies that need addressing.<p>1.  In one of the movies, it shows Ecco swimming around Atlantis AS A FISH, meaning that Atlantis was supposed to be played in well, a fishy state.<p>2.  A screenshot shows the Circle dolphin as a pure white dolphin instead of decorated.<p>3.  A screenshot shows Ecco by the crane in Master of Forgotton Skills without the labor harness.<p>As we can see here, Ecco was probably going to be a much different game than the one we all know and love....<p><A HREF="http://histronic.tripod.com" TARGET=_blank>SonCo Boulevard</A>

Anyway, yeah, i was wondering why the clip "a slow trip through atlantis" shows him as a fish. Also, on that soccer game, the clip has music, but the game doesn't. Anyway, i htought so too Histronic. 
Z||000007||Debaser13||01-22-2001||09:08 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||I'm guessing that the white dolphin is the one from the Four Ways level.....other than that, strange.
Z||000008||Trace Kyshad||01-22-2001||02:17 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Wierd... <p>The football game, what's the point? I managed to win (It ain't as easy as I thought), and got rewarded by being sent back to the DC screen... Go figure?<p>Still, it's entertaining

But since we're on the sub-topic of that soccer/football game, can I pretty please aska question...? Ever since I went to that sub-game, every time I start up ecco now and choose to "Continue Game"...it makes me start at the begining of that stupid soccer/football event! It's annoying! At first I couldn't win since it was so hard, and I thought by winning, "Continue Game" would start me where I needed to be. But nope! I was wrong...even after beating that dolphin at his lil game, to this day, I always have to choose "Load Game" in order to continue my game...! I know that may not have made sense, but has this happened to anyone else? <i>*dolphingirl needs to know so she won't go insane*</i>

I don't know if my "Continue Game" function ever started working again...<i>*shrugs*</i>....oh well...thanks for the reply though Reptyx!
Z||000012||blackfin||01-22-2001||04:41 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||That soccer game did the same thing to me, it's almost like it never got finished or something....
Z||000013||vantid||01-23-2001||08:01 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Well, I didnt have that problem.  As soon as I beat the soccer game, the powers of levitation level was loaded and i got sent back to the beginning. That didnt matter though cuz ive already beat that game anyway. Wasnt DOTF supposed to be hard? The only trouble i had was with perpetual fluidity.
Z||000014||Reptyx||01-23-2001||05:01 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx_h.jpg"> <p>The preview movie that shows the white Circle dolphin has very cool music that wasn't used in the game! the video that shows Ecco battling the octopus has unused music too.
Z||000015||Histronic||01-23-2001||08:09 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard.gif"> I know the white dolphin was Circle because it shows him singing the Hymn of Unity.  As for the football game, I was one of the few lucky enough to get it without consulting the cheats section <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">  I had to use the walkthrough to beat Power of Levitation, though....  Oh well.<br>I only knew about the Atlantis clip, but as I remember, I also downloaded anothe rclip where the whale asks Ecco to do tricks.  I could be mistaken, but I think it was the adult who asked it!
Z||000016||blackfin||01-23-2001||10:54 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||fasinating....
Z||000017||vantid||01-24-2001||08:47 AM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||You're right Histronic...I saw that whale clip yesterday but I didnt even pick up on it. Which clip has the white dolphin? Also, the soccer ball in the clip is red and yellow in the video while the game has a regular black and white soccer ball. And we all know about the lieing glyph at that crocodile boss...I bet that the programmers either forgot to arrange it to where you have to follow riddle or ran out of time...DOTF seems to be only 98% complete and has way more bugs and glitches than most other games I've played.  <br>

Z||000019||Histronic||01-24-2001||04:36 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard.gif"> The glitches probably came from the fact that they used GameWorld builder.<br>The white dolphin isn't in a clip, but in one of the pictures.  I think it is titled "A bit of storyline" or something like that.

It shows Ecco talking to the white circle dolphin and then swimming into the tunnel towards the crimson. There clip continues in two other files which show Ecco staining his flippers in crimson, talking to the crimson dolphin and then the dolphins sing the Hymn of Unity and Ecco swims inside the shrine.

I though I followed it when I beat it... or have I missed something?<p>Oh, and your artwork... it's very, very <i>very</i> cool!! ^_^

Anyway, as soon as I find one, I will scan those pics for ye, they are awesome!<p>And yeah, Vantid, your artwork is sooo cool, WOW! <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup"> <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup"> <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup"> <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup"> <IMG SRC="thumbup.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="thumbup">

Z||000026||blackfin||01-26-2001||03:50 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||no but you can use the giant spikes to kill it if you want, (hit the spikes on the roof with the power or sonar so they fall on him...)
Z||000027||Histronic||01-26-2001||05:32 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard.gif"> What did you think it was there for?<br>It is easier just to ram him, I think<br>
Z||000028||blackfin||01-26-2001||08:09 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||yes it is, thats why most people never find the 'real' way of killing him.
Z||000029||Reptyx||01-28-2001||09:17 AM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx_h.jpg"> <br>you don't have to pay attention to what that glyph on Perpetual Fluidity says either, the one that gives the color sequence. But I guess you do what it says anyway, even if you don't keep track of in which order you turn the colors and just go after the water level and which doors that need to be opened instead.
Z||000030||yogoat||01-31-2001||06:13 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||I had the real way of beating him...You see, not many people noticed it, but if you just swam into the beast, he would puke out one of those metasphere things that let you turn into other people...soo, I touched it, and immediately turned into the Crocodile Hunta.  I swam onto the king croc and made it cry for mercy!!  then I turned back into ecco...And that was the <i>real</i> way of doing thangs!<br>
