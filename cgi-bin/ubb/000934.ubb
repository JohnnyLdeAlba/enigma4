Z||000000||vantid||06-29-2001||03:55 PM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||Okay some of you may remember this from arkons OLD forum, the join in da story thing? well im gonna start it again, except on MY planet Etain with NO human influence what so ever...no technology, no humanoid anthro furried yadda yadda. So if yer character is not human, please throw em in...and i want to keep this serious pleeze...something dark and beautiful and with flare...no jerry springer an alla dat. okay, here goes.<br>"Where is the edge of the world?"<br>The young dolphin gaezed at the other figure with eyes like blue star sapphires.<br>"Its there..." the othe said, indicating the direction with a flick of his head. "..and there, and there, and ther." He pointed in each of the cardinal directions.<br>The young one frowned in consternation. "But..." he didnt understand. "but there cant be an edge. The world is round...everyone know that." He looked at the other.<br>"You so sure?" He  **** ed an eye ridge.<br>"Yeah...of course. Spheres are infinitely round. There is no edge...no end at all. It just keeps turning forever."<br>"Ah" the other nodded. "And you know this because thats a rule of mathematics....numbers are infinite and such. But you see there is a loophole to infinities. There IS a finite to the infinite."<br>The young one shook his head vigourously. "no no youre wrong" he exclaimed, his voice full of the childish excitement to prove an adult wrong. "Because numbers are forever...they never and even between 0 an 1 its infifnite cuz you can divide and divide on an on and never stop."<br>The figure smiled. "And you believe there is no end to infinity? That it all goes on forever and ever? So tell me...what is infinity?"<br>"Easy...that which goes on forever..." It sounded very lame.<br>"Forever?! Is that all you can say? Forever?"<br>"Well, yeah...." the young one furrowed his brows, confusion misting his gaze.<br>The other looked at him sharply. "Why is it you cant give me the tangible number? Hmm? The figure 8 on its side? No! You can give me one..." he held out a flipper..."you can give me two..." he held out the other flipper. "You can give me 200 fish or 9 million krill or 1838474999402 and a third atoms but you cant give me infinity?"<br>The young one stared dumbfounded. "No...no...of course not..thats...thats impossible. Its just a theory..."<br>The other took his belittling stare off the young one to gaze into the depths of the sea.<br>"You limit your mind to what you can comprehend.. Do you truly believe that the mortal mind can fully grasp the concept of the infinite?" he asked in a soft, gentle voice. He looked at the young one. <br>The young one said nothing.<br>"No child, we cant. And theres your loophole. To find the end of infinity and the edge of a sphere. Forget these ideas, these theories and open your mind. The world will begin to cahnge before your very eyes" The other looked at the youbg one. <br>The young one  **** ed his head. "So...is it possible?"<br>"To find the edge of the world?"<br>"Yes..."<br>"When you find the edge of the world infinity will be at your disposal. IF you find it....only IF you truly want to."<br>The other gave the young one a long. dark look before backing into the inky blackness of the ocean.<br>"Hey! Wait!" exclaimed the young one.<br>His cry echoed in his mind....ceaseless...<br>**********************************<br>With a mental gasp N'nian opened his eyes. He stared into the sea for a moment, stranges, slighly tilted delphine eyes wide with shock. HE blinked, and shook himself. *that  ****  dream...again* he thought. He closed his blue eyes for a moment. His eyes were odd in the way that the darkness of his pupils were glazed by the blueness and that the outter edges were tilted upwards. <br>He had met that dolphin as a child so many years ago. Yet all that he had said remained in his mind for all these years. Why? And always dreaming about it...<br>N'nian swam to the surface for a breath of air. It had been two days since the attack on his pod...the demons had taken and killed the Navigator and her sister. They had been torn apart and put back togethre to serve the okulahari--the badness, the wrong. <br>N'nian sobbed once to himself. At the surface he looked into the depths of the sky, getting lost in its etherael plains. So far...so much distance... He had never found the edge of the world... But he now wished he could. What if they came back? those demons? N'nian shuddered. His pod was now only five...he, Taskin, Vinyassa, Dalgh, and Quartz. He sank below the waves, relishing the lapping of the waves as the water closed over his head. He could hear Vinyassa calling him with her sweet hollow voice. He trurned on the rolling waters and swam to her.<br>
