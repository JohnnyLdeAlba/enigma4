Z||000003||SilverFin||11-05-2000||02:51 PM||stenellas@yahoo.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ctv.es/USERS/stenellas/post-omega_dolphin3.gif">  The game name it's Diver's Dream. Called Dolphin's Dream  in some zones. It's for playstation, and it's from Konami. The main characters are a french man called Jean, diver with some Dolphin affinity, an old man who was responsable from the tresaure safety, and a nice gal. The target of the game it's recover a tresaure crown from a sunken ship, a titanic-looking huge ship. You can recover hundreds of little tresaures on your way and sell them to upgrade equipment (you begin with no equip).<br>The game has some different zones to explore,  and the ship it's divided in some zones too.<br>Dolphins are appearing some times in the game, you help them, and they will help you. This mpg it's the alternative ending. I never saw it before... I was testing a utility to play psx video and I found it.
