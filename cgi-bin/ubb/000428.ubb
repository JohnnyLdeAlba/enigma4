He once was a human being before his crimes as a stinkin barbarian who tryed to marry a queen led to him being cursed by the god apollo (a dolphin god of the sea in my story) The curse was he'd spend the rest of his days with his queen as a dolphin lost in the sea.<p>Xoivnokra lost his queen evetualy and when he died spent his days guarding her sacred crystal and searching for her as well as feeding off of souls for an eternity<p>Xoivnokra did have a son who both didnt have nothing in common. The two only have one thing and that was they both could not die. Because the father himself was already dead and the son was an immortal!

There is a greek story where appollo turned into a dolphin, but i don't remember it, anyways you could say he was the god of dolphins.  sorry arkon, the role was already filled before you came along!
