A||||4||dragonboy||question for those who know mp3 and digital audio
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-08-2000||05:52 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||Does anyone know if it is possibly to turn an mp3 format into digital.  What I'm trying to get at is that I want to record mp3s onto a cd that I can play on my stereo.  Now I know you can hook one's computer into a stereo and record analog-style with a cassete, but I like cds better.  I'd like to make my own ecco DOTF soundtrack.

Wow, you must be some kind of patience god if you can wait. Nah, take your car, take 3 or 4 good tapes, no, all your best tapes, some money for buy some junk food at dirty gas stations and launch yourself in a great big quest for a cd-recorder. Discover the hidden plesaure of driving far from home, discover how feels the true trucker every day. Run on a straight highway while you see the sunset in the far mountains, roam in unknown roads in a endless search of adventure... hurry, get your car now and become a road warrior in the next four hours.<p>If all that doesn't sound great and cool to you, wait for your sister.
