Z||000026||dragonboy||11-01-2000||03:06 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||hey debaser, have you read anything on lunar: eternal blue for playstation.  How different is it going to be compared to the sega cd version?  The lunar<IMG SRC="crookedsmile.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="crooked smile">ss was very different from the original, and was very enjoyable.
Z||000027||Debaser13||11-01-2000||03:43 PM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fedebaser.gif"/IMG SRC> Unlike Lunar : SSSC, it's not going to be changed as much, although the translation and graphics are being redone, of course. It's still supposed to be looking great, though.<p>It's supposed to be coming out November 29th, and I've got mine pre-ordered, via my mother. Can't wait; it's one of the big games of the season.
Z||000028||dragonboy||11-01-2000||06:44 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||cool, thanks debaser.  i did hearb that the game is gonna be larger, so ieven if the story is going to be the same, i hope its expanded.  Hopefully i'll be getting this at christmas, along with the next zelda, and ff9.  I'd get these earlier, but why not have my family get them for me since i am not the richest guy.  dragonboy is a poor college student <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">
Z||000029||Coral||11-01-2000||07:37 PM||ntraver@epix.net||I'm getting Zelda Majora's Mask! It looks so cool!

But thankfully I have kind relatives who are dying to get me gaves, so I sent a long LONG list of RPGS for Christmas. I'm really looking foreward to BOF4 too, the artwork looks amazing......
