A||||26||HazardousRaptor||Does DOTF fit the Ecco storyline?
Z||000000||HazardousRaptor||06-14-2001||06:57 PM||hedgehog@nb.net||Why am I even putting this in the shape of a question? I personally feel that it does. And I can explain why,in case your not convinced. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><p>In DOTF,it is said that for 500 years,man and dolphin have lived in peace and unity.<br>For many,that signals that it CAN'T be the origninal Ecco,because he would be dead by then,right? <p>Not neccesarily. Consider this. In the end of TTOF the narration states that Ecco "Has dissapeared into the tides of time..." so Ecco could have just travelled 500 years into the future!<p>What about the beutiful,good future ecco traveled to in TTOT? He must have traveled even farther that time. Like 1,000 or more years.<p>That would have allowed enough time for dolphins to evolve large fins,and telekinetic powers. And the abilty to fly.<p>There are other issues...Like the Foe and Vortex. But I can't really think of theorys, Does anybody have any?<br>
Z||000001||yogoat||06-14-2001||07:54 PM||||All I can say is this...Earth is having a lotta problems!  The foe, then the Vortex...<p>Someone please prove me wrong, because I refuse to think over a lot of what I'm saying.  It's really hard to keep track of time things like this...Anyways, Tides of Time had a lot of glitches in it with it's theories...I don't believe the multiple future thing.  It's either one or the other, they should've thrown out the Good Future one...and...Ah,  **** , I forgot what I was thinking about!! *tries to think everything through, and instantly falls on the floor unconscious*
Z||000002||dolphingirl||06-14-2001||10:17 PM||bigglesworth00@go.com||I don't know what I could add to the theories that you've already explained, other than...I found it fascinating what you described HazardousRaptor! Perhaps that was the first time it had been explained so simple to me...and I actually understood every last bit of what you said (even having not played Tides of Time)! So...kudos to you and your wonderful explanation of events... <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> 
Z||000003||GTK||06-15-2001||01:14 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Having been a member of the Zelda fan community for quite a while, I've seen what happens when people try to find continuity in games that were never meant to be chronological. The Zelda saga is the best example of this as the story "grew up" over the years. There are at present eight games and about four or five theories as to which order they come in! <p>Ecco isn't Zelda, though--since there are only three games and they were made over a much shorter period, it seems more possible that they could fit together. Regarding a possible Ecco timeline, I do allow that the Foe are very different from the Vortex and are presumably not the same ones. It could well be that Ecco returned to the future after ToT... the only problem I have with that is that, of course, our delphine friend doesn't have any of the powers he had before, such as infinite air (now wouldn't THAT have been handy...). But eh, that's probably poetic license. <p>Well done for a well-constructed theory, HR ^_^ Still, I'm not using it for Tidesinger. Maybe it's an alternate-universe after all... 
Z||000004||GTK||06-15-2001||01:16 AM||gtkelpie@hotmail.com||Oh yeah, while I'm thinking about it--wouldn't there be some sort of legend going the rounds about Ecco if this was the future? 
Z||000005||DolphinJoy||06-15-2001||07:13 AM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||But there is legend..remember "Anguish of Dearth," when the Keeper of Stories tells u the story of the traveller?   Isn't that Ecco?<p>My theory is that "Ecco" is actually a great great great grandson of the origional Ecco we know and love.  Think about it...we have Ecco Jr, who's probably the son of Ecco.  Plus, the stars on the head of DotF Ecco are different to the other Eccos.  Moreover, Ecco is re-taught new skills in in DotF that he learned in the other Ecco games.<p>-Treefin
Z||000006||blackfin||06-15-2001||07:32 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I have an entire story written to link the games but that is reserved for my game when ever I have time for it, unless people would rather I spoil it and just tell you it as a story now?
Z||000007||Trace Kyshad||06-15-2001||08:28 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||The thing is, the "Great Exodus" (As my fanfic will call it) when Man and Dolphin kind just packed up and left, leaving the other Dolphins to protect Earth, the story simply states that "And it was this time, Ecco appeared"<p>So take this, yes. At the end of ToT, Ecco got forwarded far into the future... right to the point where Man and Dolph leave.  Because of the Vortex's existence back in the dawn of life, the true Dolphin existence never existed, (The future with flying Dolphins). The V Queen had corrupted the timeline by existing back in the jurrasic or whatever age, therefore the "good future" would never exist.<p>Another theory would be that, quite simply, the reason the dolphins of the future in DotF don't fly is because the future Ecco visited in Tides of Time was faaaaaar beyond 500 years. Humans had gone, the Earth remained with giant landmasses, and the skies, of which Dolphins could not travel. Evolution takes it's place and allows Dolphins to fly, and builds them skyways and such. This theory also denotes that Dolphins could have reached this tech far earlier if the timeline had gone the way of "Dolphin's Nightmare" (The Clan, Hanging Waters) etc.<p>Anyway...<p>That's my thoery... or at least one of them, the other will be told in "Search for Genesis", me upcomin' Fanfic
Z||000008||DolphinJoy||06-15-2001||08:50 AM||ecothedolphin@hotmail.com||Actually, there is this strange connection between the Dolphins Nightmare and Trellia's Future isn't there?? The Hanging Waters are really like the sky waters of the good future, while the Clan dolphins do bear an uncanny resemblance to the Future dolphins (long flippers, larger than average, large dorsal fins) 
Z||000009||yogoat||06-15-2001||11:05 AM||||Hey, sorry if I'm posting things that have all ready been said, I just want to say this before I lose the thought of it!<p>in DotF, we well know dolphins can't fly.  Correct?  And in the advanced future of ToT, they CAN fly, correct?  Well...in the good future, there's no guardian, yet there's an asterite.  But in DotF, there's no asterite but a guardian, meaning the asterite must have died if this did fit the ecco storyline.  But he couldn't have died, because in the good future he's still there.  Therefore, that part doesn't fit the ecco story line...at all.<p>And about ToT itself...I just found out it's the most boolsheet I've seen in a while.  Now, I've never played through this entire game myself, so I'm kind of guessing on things.  But, it's impossible for Trellia to come to Ecco when he hasn't restored the Asterite yet.  And why not?  Because if Ecco's Present played out in time, it'd end up as a vortex land.  And Ecco found out about the Asterite's problem fromt he future asterite...which looked just a little bit too cool.  So THEN the good future was available, but only because someone from the good future came when it wasn't available.  Just a little glitch I found out about...
Z||000010||Alastor||06-15-2001||11:48 AM||snaredrum181@aol.com||Well, In all reality, thats the glory of "time" related video games. Unless there has been one that I missed, very few video games portray time in the way that we as humans understand it. Think Chrono Trigger (if anyone here has played it)  <IMG SRC="smilie43.gif" HEIGHT=25 WIDTH=24 BORDER=0 ALT="silly"> , which has the heroes going into the future, and finding out about the end of the world, then, going into the past to stop the end of the world. If this was real, then when they killed the killer, they never would have found out about him in the future, therefore, never having cause to go back in time to stop the killer because they never knew about him. (whew) lots of typing.<br>Therefore, creating a big freakin paradox.<br>there. I have got to go, so hope you got all that.<br>
Z||000011||Trace Kyshad||06-15-2001||12:04 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||What Alastor said made perfect sense to me (Big heavy Sci Fi/Trekkie here). <p>That's the thing about Time Travel in games and movies, there's much debate on how it would go about. Say for example, the present would already be affected by something you do in the future (Example - Bill and Ted, when they meet themselves near the beginning of the film, and later on go back in time to be the BnT who met the original BnT... yeah!)<p>However, technically, if what Alastor was taken into account was true...<p>At the beginning of the game, Ecco would go to Atlantis... and that'd be it. Unless you go for the theory that Ecco only destroyed the Foe queen in an alternate Timeline, therefore the Foe Queen in the original "Isle of Tranquility" timeline still exists.<p>You know, this does make sense...
Z||000012||Reptyx||06-15-2001||12:06 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com||er... sorry for ruining your theories, but the Time machine can only be used to travel into the past. (That's why Ecco can't use the time machine to get to the Vortex future.)<p>As for the sky-ways, they were apparently created in the "great eruptions", whatever that is, which probably happened at least ten thousand years ago.<p><br>"There is no way to travel to the future with the Atlantean time machine. The time machine can only move you up the stream of time into the past"<p>"The floating islands were born from the great eruptions"<p>"Ten thousand years ago, we swam above the surface and rose above the land"<p>(Of course, there are ways around that... the Asterite could've been wrong about the time machine, the sky-ways didn't necessarily come into existence at the same time and in the same way as the floating islands, ...)
Z||000013||HazardousRaptor||06-15-2001||02:23 PM||hedgehog@nb.net|| **** ,you have a good point,there Reptyx.<p>Okay,let me try and explain this one.  <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="roll eyes">  Don't worry,I'm good at this... <IMG SRC="confused.gif" HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="confused"> <p>Suppose,just maybe,the Time Machine had some unknown ability that only Ecco could unlock? True,the Atlantians could not,but what if Ecco somehow found a way for it to work,and reverse the effect. It's not that much of a stretch,really.<p>As for the great eruption,or whatever,that could have simply happened wayyyyy into the future,and when the islands filled with water,it encouraged the Dolphins to evolve.<p>There,solved yet another problem.

Z||000014||blackfin||06-15-2001||04:42 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Changing the purpose of items is a stretch in my opinion, Appaloosa said you can't travel into the future with the time machine so you can't full stop in my opinion, my story takes it's own path, it has a split timeline that changes the timeline from the old ecco to the dof one and explains the goft globes and a few other things, in fact I think I've got most loose ends tired up ^_^
Z||000015||Trace Kyshad||06-15-2001||05:45 PM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||It makes sense really...<p>Take this. The past HAS happened, therefore you can travel back to it<p>The Future HAS NOT happened, therefore you cannot travel to it.<p>Maybe Atlantians followed that idea
Z||000016||yogoat||06-15-2001||07:28 PM||||*rubs trace's head*  You're a genius, man!
Z||000017||Whitefin Dolphinius||06-15-2001||07:28 PM||loutus_leopard@hotmail.com||*nods* I think Trace is right. The Atlantians probly thought that way to also protect the future. <p>But as I remember at the end of ToT, It said something how Ecco had lost himself and the time machine in the stream of time.<br>I think that he WAS sent into the future. This future was before the future of ToT.<p>Lost already with what I'm saying?<p>Anyways, In DoTF they had the guardian. Did anyone else think that either<br>1. The Asterite Evolved into a greater being.<br>or<br>2. The Asterite CREATED the Guardian, as if he knew something was going to happen.<p>Ne, I'm saying this and I've never played DoTF, I only have a film of the Prologue on my iMac.<p>So, what HR said about Ecco going into the future could be right.<br>Hmmmm, I am so itching to e-mail Ed again to see how the storys link up.....<p><br>Whitefin
Z||000018||HazardousRaptor||06-15-2001||09:21 PM||hedgehog@nb.net||Very nice theorys,Trace and Whitefin! Honestly!  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <p><br> 
Z||000019||HazardousRaptor||06-15-2001||11:21 PM||hedgehog@nb.net||Now,let's see if we can think of theorys for other 'mysteries'.<p>The asterite,for example. Was this guy,simply,in his cave minding his own bussiness while Ecco was out risking his dorsal fin?  Seeing as how the DOTF ending mentioned that "Intelligence built them the Gaurdian" and therefore,seems unlikely the Asterite built it. BUT for all we know,the Asterite certainly could have *helped*.<p>Or Big 'A' Could have simply been 'incapacatated' at the time. Perhaps he lost his 'marbles' again?  <IMG SRC="laugh.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh">  <IMG SRC="smilie37.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="laugh">   <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <p>One has to admit,bringing The Gaurdian his crystal shards was simular to bringing the Asterite back his orbs.<p>Then again,we were never really given information as to where the glyphs come from. (I never played the first Ecco,so if there is and I don't know...) So could the the Gaurdian send it's glyphs back to help Ecco,so he could help him in the future?<p>Okay,that's our next topic,let's crack it!<p>HazardousRaptor....Needs to pay for her copy of Ecco:The Dolphin. <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>"That which does not kill me had better be able to run away  ****  fast."<p>"Raptor.<br> You run with the wind.<br> Raptor.<br> You strike unseen.<br> Raptor.<br> You keep the balance.<br> Raptor.<br> Truth, you have sought.<br> Raptor.<br> Goddess of the hunt.<br> Raptor.<br> Protect thy young with your own precious life.<br> Raptor.<br> Darter through the clustered trees.<br> Raptor.<br> Wolfine in all habits and appearance.<br> Raptor.<br> You are wise.<br> Raptor.<br> You stay with your pack.<br> Raptor.<br> So much we do not know.<br> Raptor.<br> Let us not know...Together.<br> Raptor....<br> Will you run with me?"<p>- A folklore chant/song on Moubius (My fantasy world) where raptors are worshiped,and sentient.<br>

Naw...but really, that was an incredible thread of messages to read through. All the different theories people have about it...fascinating! I agree mostly with what Trace, Reptyx, and yogoat said. Sounds the most logical. All the other theories were great to read too! Really is crazy how many versions of the storyline you can get going! <IMG SRC="smilie8.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="sick"> Anyway though, blackie I can't wait to hear your story...what with all the lose ends pretty much tied up! <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face"><p>I'd contribute something...but my head's really spinning now...plus it's late...and the aspect of "time travel" shouldn't be thought of at such hours of the day...heheh!
Z||000021||blackfin||06-16-2001||08:36 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Well my story is a while away from public realease, I don't really want to spoil my game I've decided but at any rate when I gave one of my earl drafts to Arkon and crestoe to read they seemed reasonablly impressed with it and you know they are hardlly my biggest fans <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000022||PsySonic||06-16-2001||09:37 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Oh well... talking about time travel is always so confusing... When I played Ecco DotF i had the feeling that many happenings were taken from the first games. Mabye it's a parallel universe?<p>Anyway, Hazardous Raptor, in Ecco 1 on Genesis the glyphs of the library in Atlantis tell Ecco that the Atlanteans built the glyphs especially for him. So, that's about it.<p>That's also wierd, cause in DotF they are parts of the guardian and connected to him. The only connection would be that they were made in Atlantis...<p>But even though, the Ecco TOT good future could not happen after Ecco DotF, cause dolphins united with humans in DotF, built the guardian and explored space and stuff, so that should have been mentioned in Ecco TOT (which would be of course very unlikely). On the other hand, like somebody else already said, those flying dolphins should be in Ecco DotF. Maybe they died out?<p>Anyway, I liked the theory with the Vortex queen changing the stream time when she was sent into the past best. Maybe she killed the Asterite? Maybe the whole Ecco DotF timeline has happened because of the Vortex queen changing thing in Earths antiquity...<p>Uh, there are so many theories, they really make your head spin  <IMG SRC="smilie44.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rolling"> 
Z||000023||blackfin||06-17-2001||08:12 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||THats my idea, but I can't say much without spoiling my game, I think that the Vortex queen altered history in the past (I find it a hard idea she could just appear back there and do nothing) it also involves the Atlantians (renember they escape to the past, I explain what happened to them as well, I cover the asterite and also the 'gift' globes that the foe steal from dolphins (I don't believe that you can take something away like that but if it was somethig added in artficially.....)  but really I'e already said too much... you'll just have to wait for the game.. <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">
Z||000024||Trace Kyshad||06-17-2001||10:10 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||My story doesn't link into DoF at all, for various reasons. Basically humans went the way theyt were going and pretty muched left the Earth alone in search of other resources, leaving it behind completely and leaving it to the DOlphins, some of which tried to gain and use Man's technoledgy for themselves...<p>Basically, Ecco turns up and wonders why this isn't quite the future he'd seen before, nor does he know how he got there.<p>Needless to say, there's many plots which all narrow down to a certain race extracting their revenge from their defeat millenia ago...
Z||000025||dolphingirl||06-18-2001||03:42 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com||Well, those are all fascinating story ideas guys! I can't wait till the finished products come out...whenever that may be! <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">
