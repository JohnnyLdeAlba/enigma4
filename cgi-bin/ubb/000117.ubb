Notice that you must help him through dangerous areas, its almost as though he can't see his enemies and thats why he needs you to help overcome them. Go back to those levels if you must and tell me if you think he's blind, the only things that make me think otherwise are that you'd think he'd tell you if he was and he knows that there is a window in the torture chamber. But otherwise I think he might be blind.

A dolphin's sense of sight and hearing are equally dominant in a dolphin's brain.  so they can perceive by not only reflected light frequencies (sight) but also reflected sound frequencies (hearing, i.e. echolocation) as well.  But if a blind dolphin ascends the water level,his echolocation will prove ineffectual since their emitted frequencies dissipate in air almost immediately.

Perhaps he's blind and he thinks the enemy might hear him using his echolocation and would give away his location? But then you'd think he would use it in the caverns level as the dolphins already know where he is so it doesn't matter if they hear him or not. Also, he knows exactly where the tunnels are in that last part of caverns of hope. Or perhaps he's not blind at all and they just needed those sections to be difficult. In entrapment that makes enough sense because he's probably just weak and can't proceed without you. Also notice he is quite small and perhaps has difficulty withstanding attacks? You'd think that in caverns of hope he could at least dodge around the enemies as best he could instead of cowardly fleeing back to the beginning(what kind of resistance leader is that?). I'm really not to sure.
