Z||000002||That guy with the hat||10-16-2000||07:28 PM||||Umm... no thats not quite it I'd have to show you a picture of me, but its not scanned or on any site yet. Not to sound rude or anything, but its not a yellow hat or that kind of hat at all. Its actually a baseball cap, a black one with a blue brim and the SEGA logo on it(OK I don't actually have a hat like that, but if I drew him with the hat I do wear ALL THE TIME, no one would get it), and I'm a darker green than that. Remember, the echidnas don't have visible ears. Don't anyone worry about making a face pic for me. I'll do one by my own self. Besides, it will save a lot of trouble.
