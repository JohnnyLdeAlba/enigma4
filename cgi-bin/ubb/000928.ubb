I'm going to see wild dolphins too in a few weeks, at Cardigan Bay, Wales.<p>Seeing wild dolphins is infinately better than seeing them at one of those dolphin prisons (such as Sea World, Marineland and hundreds of others).  You'll be seeing them on their own terms, behaving naturally, able to come and go at will.  Unlike those poor captive dolphins, removed from their natural home and incarcerated in concrete where they must jump through hoops/// <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">  <IMG SRC="smilie3.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="mad">  I'd urge everyone who really loves these animals NOT to visit Sea World...you'll only be supporting the capture and enslavement of these wonderful, intelligent creatures.  Go out and see the real thing, in the ocean!  Trust me, its not difficult...there's far more places in the world where you can watch wild dolphins than captive ones.<p>So have a wonderful time, I'm sure you will!!!  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">

But I'm land-locked in Ontario Canada....the only way I could afford to see dolphins would be to go to Marineland and that will NEVER happen. <br>I went to that place a few years ago. I spent two thirds of the time crying cuz of seeing the Orcas and dolphins jumping around in a little pool (a VERY little pool at the time)...I was SO upset, and the worst part was that no one else could see the reason WHY I was upset. All in all, it was a terrible experience and I'll NEVER do it again!   <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown">

Z||000006||Queen Zeal||06-28-2001||10:21 AM||bradley5@yadtel.net||i never knew sea world was such an evil place. well i'm going to my dads house in texas next month, and that's when my family is going to sea world, so i'm lucky i don't have to see something so horroriffic as captive dolphins and whales. i feel so badly for thier families. some day i hope all marine life parks will become illegal to run and will have to be shut down. lets all pray that we will be alive to see all parks like that are closed down. bye, have a good day<br>
Z||000007||Histronic||06-28-2001||10:52 AM||john__cool@hotmail.com||Perhaps if the dolphins rebelled....<br>Anyway, that's very fortunate dragonboy, but I read that wild dolphins don't hang around humans very long!  Only a few minutes at a time.

Whales too! Something to do with the water getting warmer? I may go to Caldy Island sometime over the summer, where there's regular dolphin/whale watching trips and so forth. Anyway, I'll scan some photos if I get any decent ones and then everyone can see 'em ^_^
