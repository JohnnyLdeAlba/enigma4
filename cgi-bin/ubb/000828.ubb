Lilly: E.C.C.O" and to be honest I never thought that there could be so much coincidence in the world.<p>First I only found a site which showed the cover very small... There:  <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~falcone/covers.html" TARGET=_blank>http://home.earthlink.net/~falcone/covers.html</A> . The cover really got me there, I thought, a CD called like our favorite hero won't be enough, it even has dolphins on it!<p>But when I did some more research I found a site which showed the cover larger, has a tracklist and even some music excerpts! There:  <A HREF="http://www.w2.com/docs2/b1/ecco.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.w2.com/docs2/b1/ecco.html</A>  Now ain't that cool?!? Listen to the music, some of it really sounds like the Ecco music we know and love.<p>So, that's all from me for... uhh... I don't know...<p>I'm sorry guys, I like all of you pals, but this time also had to come for me "oldbie"... I will still look for you now and then, especially for > you > Reptyx, and please don't be upset, guys and gals, there are always new people to come, now that you also found that new community.<p>Keep on visiting my site <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> *tzk tzk  <A HREF="http://www.sonicspeedway.de.vu" TARGET=_blank>http://www.sonicspeedway.de.vu</A>  cough cough* <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"><p>Well, and now, I think, I should a last...

We meet again.<p>Some years ago I was looking for research material for a dolphin-related story, and found a book by a John C. Lilly ("Man and Dolphin") in a used-book store. It messed up the first several versions of my story, because the guy's beliefs are, ah, unsupported by facts. (I hear he has a son who's into telepathy and other nonsense.) Anyway, I had no idea he'd done music; it's almost certainly the same guy. And this doesn't mean the music can't be good.
