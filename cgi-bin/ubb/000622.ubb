You accomplish this by searching for the other four gems, and bringing them to the Guardian. Each one puts a ring above the four small temples. Go and jump through the rings, and each one will make one of the accelerator rings complete. Then to activate them, you have to go inside the big temple and sonar each of the four glowing globes. That turns each accelerator ring on.<p>Then, go to the very bottom the ground, a bit away from the first ring, and start pumping the A button. Get lined up right with all the other rings, and as soon as you pass through the first ring, just hold the A button down. You may have been charging with the B button through the rings, in which case that won't get you anywhere. So just swim with the A button, and with a bit of practice...you'll eventually get to that "hard-to-reach" fifth gem.<p>Hope that helped...<IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">

I never actually used vigour for these rings, actually I only used it to pull that stone into the hole easilier... I think I needed 15-20 times till I got it for the first time... And after that also for many times...
