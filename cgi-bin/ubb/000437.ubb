I know this has absolutly nothing to do with any relevant topic that has even been said before and should indeed carry a off topic warning and all the respective notices that what I'm about to say has nothing to do with anything at all but...<p>Has anyone played 'Escape from Monkey Island?'

I'll look at your current face pic and the pic at your web site, but if you have any special wishes about it ( especially about color and such), let me know.<p>This can be interesting... <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p><p>
