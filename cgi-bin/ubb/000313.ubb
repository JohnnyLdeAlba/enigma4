I went to Florida (KeyLargo) and went to a place called Dolphin Plus (or Dolphin +) and they give you a choice of two swims. 1. Structured: You will be given a handler and two trained, tame dolphins. 2. You will snorkel in the harbour/salt river type of thing running along side with semi-wild dolphins.<br>We did the structured, as I was 10 at the time and (shame on me) was not very adept with a snorkel. We were assigned two bottle-nosed dolphins, Dinghy and ........ KIMBIT! First we just held our hand on the surface and stroked the dolphins as they swam by, then we held out our arms and the dolphins sort of tail-walked upand we grabbed their flippers and they sort of jumped up. Then we threw out a ball and they fetched it. After that, we one by one (1 family per trainer and two dolphins) got in and were pulled round by holding the dorsal fin, and were pushed round as we lay on our fronts and they pushed our feet with their beaks. Kimbit dragged me out and wouldn't let me back! He got hold of my feet in his mouth, very gently, so it didn't hurt, but those teeth are actually very sharp (I'm glad I ain't a fish!). <br><IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"><br>PS just in case you wondered, the dolphisn weren't forced to do it, (the people nextto us were nervous and therefore the dolphins did not do so much as swim up to the surface. You are also given a safety talk before hand.
