ARGARGRGG!!!!<p>Well, I'm making good progress ^^ But you'd think the Clan coulda just handed me the thing and saved all this bother, <p>needless to say, you're gonna here a lot of screaming from central Scotland now and again as Ecco rockets toward the ground...<p>So does it get easier?

There are several hard parts, I found the three tubes side by side with currents and jelly gates the hardest. Isn't it freaky when you are in tube with a curent pushing you along real quick and it suddenly plummets down? I feel so ill. Just a tip to stop dying being so boring.....acrobatics in the air. How many back-flips can you do before Ecco whacks the ground?
