A||||9||Pharphignewton||Speaker on sexism
Z||000000||Pharphignewton||11-25-2000||09:52 AM||mailbox@aol.com||Last night, I went to a talk on sexism with my friend.  It seemed odd to me how she began her lecture.  First, she told a joke on the stupidity of males, then a blonde joke.  I found it interesting that she was neither male or blonde.  Anyways, she spoke on how women are contnually treated as inferiors and need equality.  Although I aggreed with most of what she said, I still couldn't believe that she began by insulting over half of her audience!!  Her joke on males was the one about how someone had a brain transplant and the female brain was less expensive because it was used.  Although it seems funny, it would become offensive if ou switch "man and woman" with "black and white", or "christian and jew".  As you can see, I believe in equality, and am impossible to offend, but I can't help but feel that this woman had sabotaged her talk from the start, from simple jokes that were best left unsaid.  Anyone care to comment?

I just brought it to mind because I thought it was wierd how hypocritical the speaker was being by beginning a lecture on how everyone should be treated equally reguardless of color or sex by telling jokes that would turn off the very audience she was trying to talk to.  That's all.

I have read up on mot religions and spiritual practices and have formed my own path in a manner of speaking.  But it is interestingto note that at the very core, al religions are basically the same.  maybe its time we stopped caring about the differences, and start foicusing on the similarities, don't you agree?
