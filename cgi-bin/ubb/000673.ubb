Z||000000||Cool Jane||02-15-2001||02:43 PM||andreajjj65@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> Huntington Life Sciences(HLS) near Cambridge is Europe's largest animal conract lab. They have been investigated several times.Animals like dogs(even Beagle puppies), cats,monkeys,rabbits,fish,birds and Guinea pigs are all cruelly caged behind HLS'srazor wire fence. Reports and even footage show:<br>1)500 animals die in there every day.<br>2)The animals are force fed drugs(through a  pipe) straight into their stomachs.<br>3)Beagle puppies are punched during poisoning experiments.<br>4)NO animal leaves HLS alive.<br>5)They are left to die in small, dark cramped cages.<br>6) They themselves admit that 75-95% of testing is useless. <IMG SRC="smilie13.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="crying">  <p>I am not totally against animal testing because someone very close to me has cancer but can someone out there tell me that this is murder!

Test Group C will be our control and they will live in tiny metal cages in the vehement sun of Death Valley throughout the experiment with sewage water and waste particles to munch on.

Z||000030||vantid||03-13-2001||10:14 PM||vantid@gmx.co.uk||I might get stoned for sayin this, but animal testing is necessary. Mice and rats reproduce quickly, as well as many other small to medium sized mammals. You cant test humans because it is innefficiant and too expensive. However......worthless and inconsistant tests that are cruel should be banned and offenders should be severly punished. Beating an animal has nothing to do with any kind of legitimate testing. You hafta be incredibly stupid to not know what a beating will do to the body. AW, now im getting all pissed off...that had better not be censored...miffed off.
