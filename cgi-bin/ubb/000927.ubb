A very funny man.<p>Just something I remembered late at night while trying to write.

For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.  But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons."<p><p>

(The first being mice, which had been doing subtle psychological experiments on humans for decades.)<p>The story:<br>He talked about his nonfiction book "Last Chance To See" -- appropriate title -- and his search for endangered species. One of these was the Yangtse River dolphin in China. Because the river is filled with silt and visibility is poor, the species evolved to lose its eyesight, relying completely on sonar. And then a certain species started putting loud machines into the river... The species is in trouble.<br>Anyway, Douglas Adams went to China to find the Yangtse River dolphin and record its sounds, but found that his crew didn't have a waterproof microphone. Someone suggested that they could waterproof the device with, ah, a certain birth-control product. So Adams wandered through nearby towns, not knowing Chinese, trying to explain to the giggling female store clerks what he wanted to buy. Before he was done he'd had to resort to pantomime and deal with a manager who insisted he knew a more effective product.

Its all about communication between humans and dolphins, and in one part that..er..birth control product is used for the same application.<p>I recommend "Dolphin Song" to anyone who loves dolphins.<p>I'll have to look out for "Last Chance to See,"  never heard of it, sounds really good!<p>
