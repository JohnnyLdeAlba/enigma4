Z||000000||blackfin||11-03-2000||08:27 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I've looked over the ideas people had earlier and I've come up with an outline for how I plan to run an art competition, I'd like any ideas people have on the outline for the competition below.<p>The competition will be drawn in 3 months time, (to give everybody plenty of time to get an entry together), everybody who enters will be able to enter one picture.  Each the person can only enter once (i,e. no entering more pictures under another name) The judging will be done as follows, every person who enters a picture will be part of the judges.  Each entrant will pick their 5 favourite pictures (you can't pic your own picture), the pictures will be ranked 1 to 5 (i.e. your most favourite to least favourite), the picture you rank as your favourite will get 5points, the one ranked 2nd favorite 4points and so on, the 5best pic will get one point, the points from everybody will be added up and the picture with the most points will be the winner.<p>The pictures can be anything at all, aslong as it is related to ecco in some way.

Z||000003||blackfin||11-03-2000||09:20 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||One for the time being, but I'll probally run more if the first one is an success.

Z||000005||blackfin||11-04-2000||07:45 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I don't think I can give away webspace as a prize. Since nobody else seems to have any more comments, I'll finalise things and launch the competition soon.

Z||000013||blackfin||11-08-2000||09:44 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I'll take those ideas into consideration, but what I am currentlly thinking of as one possibility is a custom status on the forum for the winner e.g.  "status: Best Ecco Artist"
Z||000014||dolphingirl||11-09-2000||03:10 AM||bigglesworth00@go.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/fdolphingirl.gif"> <br>Eventhough I will not be entering the art competition (sounds cool, but there's one problem~~can't draw worth a crap!), I think that the status of "Best Ecco Artist" would be awsome! If I were entering, that'd be a cool thing to win! Afterall, no one else would have that status...<IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">

I know I can come up with somthing but I don't want to! I just want to see my bro Crestoe win! Unfortantly he can't color worth crap! lets see what he's got in store!
Z||000016||Debaser13||11-11-2000||06:12 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Personally, I'd like to see a fanfic competition. For those of us who aren't artistic in the least, but can write slightly.
Z||000017||blackfin||11-11-2000||03:27 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||A fanfic competition is not a bad idea, I'll think about it.
Z||000018||Vortex of time||11-15-2000||08:45 PM||seastuff211@aol.com||I was ondering if i could clean up my picture n the computer. Its on lined paper and I would link to take those lines off. I will not do anyrhing else to it. plese answer.

How can I tell your any good? I'm not saying your any bad eithier just I want to see what kind of writer you are! I'm not trying to promote my site But you know that fanfiction section may end up as a game! All I ask is if you find any time add to it just once would be good enough!
Z||000020||blackfin||11-15-2000||10:17 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Vortex - yes you can, use of computers is alowed provided you do all the work yourself...
Z||000021||Debaser13||11-16-2000||07:30 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Sorry, I didn't even know there WAS a story section; I was kinda in a hurry. Besides, I thought everyone could read my stories here in the fanfics section. But if you want me to put 'em on your MB, sure.

Yeah basicaly i have a fanfiction storie in my forum which everyones been adding on to so far its 20 pages in length! I also posted it up in my stories section on my site but its also in the forum as well.

Z||000029||Debaser13||11-17-2000||07:38 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||No problem, just tell me what you think, eh? And I saw the add-on fic, but I like writing slower than that. Gives me time to gather my ideas, you know? I might give it a shot, though....
Z||000030||Arkonviox||11-18-2000||03:32 PM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.arkonviox.com/artwork/farkon.gif">  Your storie was good and I think you should continue with it because I can see it's headed in a good direction! You have alot of great chracters in the that are very unique my favorite was whitecap! and basicaly not give up!<p>For the longest time writing the storie to my game has been very difficult because i wasnted it to be beyond perfect! As you can see my whole sites just basicaly based on my fan-fict ecco! but in time i hope to expand it into an ecco fan-fict site<p>Since I always had trouble on the storie of my game creating the forum add on relly helped me out there in spots of my storie i could seem to jump start! My stories going exactly as I planned it and everyone who adds to it seems to make it better everytime with new things in the storie.<p>But basicaly I think keep going with what you got you have a good idea and look where im at so far with my imcomplete storie I seem to have aimed it in a good direction by having it for everyone to see ad adding to it basicaly leads to critiques who who like it or not but help you in it! and not giving up brings peoples interest to! and I mean big time!
Z||000031||Delphi||11-20-2000||08:51 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||A WRITING COMPETITION!!!!!!!!!! Now THAT'S something I COULD ENTER SINCE I HAVE NO FRIGGIN' SCANNER!!!!! ARGH! IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZYYYYYYYYY!!! (bangs head on desk) I would LOVE to show you guys my drawings!!!!
Z||000032||blackfin||11-20-2000||09:34 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Delphi, there should be somebody somewhere around you with a scanner you can use.  If there really isn't then.  Heck, send all your art to me in a parcel, I'll scan it and send it back to you...
Z||000033||Delphi||11-20-2000||11:45 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||Well, that's a thought... <br>actually, I have two friends who have scanners, but I don't really want to ask them to scan anything for me... it might be a bit much.
Z||000034||dragonboy||11-21-2000||01:00 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||come on!  they are you're friends.  it usually takes a short time to scan something so its not much of a bother.  make sure you save the pics in .jpg format for best quality.
Z||000035||blackfin||11-21-2000||01:37 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Yup, scanning is no big deal.  Just ask them Delphi, I'm sure they won't mind...
