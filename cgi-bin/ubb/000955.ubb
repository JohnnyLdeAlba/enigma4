People, it is amazing to see Ecco inside other game - is almost like to see Eiffel Tower close to the Big Ben. The only problem is the VMU: the memory is too limited. A pic with 14 Kb turns into 28 memory blocks or so.

I had never thought of that...and I think next time I pick that game up again, I'll have to do that! The idea of posting Ecco's face all over the cities...sounds exciting... <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> ...thanks for the info/idea!

I've finally got a DC-modem and send e-mails to myself (no I'm not crazy) with Ecco pictures. When I used the in JGR - ahhhhh - it was a dream in reality: I can see Ecco swimming over the walls - I swear I'm not crazy. Have you ever tried this, guys???"</i><p>this helped me understand the topic better im wondering when you take images in that game what does it do..ive never played that game before

You can create your own graffiti, use the preset ones in the game, or pull any picture off the net (provided it's in the correct format), and even use them as your design to tag the city up with! Make sense? I dunno if I explained it right...but, I hope I did... <IMG SRC="smilie16.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="demented">
