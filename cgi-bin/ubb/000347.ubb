We took her to dog shows and won ribbons with her. We were going to send her to the Nationals and maybe get a litter of puppies from Jenna, but unfortunatly she failed her hip x-rays and we had to spay her.<br>How the heck did you get that pic dragonboy?

Her registered name is White Birch Moon's Blu Crystal.<br>She likes to sleep behind the toilet in the summer, under the computer, on our beds, and on the couch. She's such a spoiled brat too!
