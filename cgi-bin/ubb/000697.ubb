I think it's very fitting, and besides that it's awsome! That's just my opinion though...but I think it'd look cool on every page...good work! <IMG SRC="smilie1.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="white face">

A suckup?! Why the hell would I have any reason to be a suck up...to blackfin?! I guess I'll just have to take my own advice I used to dish out to people, about you...

It turns things into a guessing game...heheh! So you've got 8 "a s s-ignments" (hope that worked) standing in your way of putting that effect on all the pages. Well, whenever...(and not to be a "SUCKUP")...it's a cool effect. You asked for feedback, so I gave it to you!
