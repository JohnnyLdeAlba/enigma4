Z||000007||SilverFin||10-08-2000||03:05 PM||stenellas@yahoo.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ctv.es/USERS/stenellas/post-omega_dolphin.gif">   I made that face this morning, after read arkonviox and bloodfin posts, it was made for the reply posts. A little pic looks like a great idea, and you can draw one in a few minutes, because it's little (my pic it's only 64X64, so i finished it in 10 minutes), but if you want one cooler, just like bloodfin or arkon ones, you need some more time. With photoshop and patience you can do anything yo want.<p>What program you used to do that, bloodfin?

Z||000011||SilverFin||10-08-2000||06:27 PM||stenellas@yahoo.com||It's just an animated gif, nothing special. You can do some of these with little nice programs like Animagic (I used this one).

Z||000020||Debaser13||10-09-2000||07:40 AM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||I kinda liked his look before. I know he's going for a Bowie-esque, Ziggy Stardust look this turn around, but he frightened so many more parents without the breasts.Ahhh well. Dosn't matter how he looks ; it's the music that's the big deal. He's the only popular rock star that's any good anymore.<Br> <Br> Refresh my memory ; was "Long Hard Road Out Of Hell" written for the <i> Spawn </i> soundtrack or <i> Antichrist Superstar </i> ?

And it looks cool <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> <Br> <Br> I'm sure this has been asked a million times, but what's everyone's favorite tune from the Ecco games ? Mine is  either the Time Machine song or the music that plays in Big Water in Ecco 2. It's never played again in the game, but I like it.<Br>
Z||000023||dragonboy||10-10-2000||12:39 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||my favorite track of all ecco games is the music to the library in ecco 1 (cd game)  or if you don't remember its the last track n the songs of time cd.  this particular track has a strong effect on me.  it temporarily carries me away into a an elevated atmosphere that i cannot describe well with words, its like a feeling of sprituality, unity, and purpose among other pervading emotions.  music has a very strong effect on me.  in fact i prefer the beauty of music as to the beauty of images.  so i guess you could say i would rather be blind than deaf.  any way that's my all-time favorite ecco music track, I think its too short as well, so i play it twice or more.  i like music to the ecco games (not really the cartridge games) so ranking other tracks would be difficult.  although the cd music to medusa's levels is not a prefered listening experience of mine.
Z||000024||SilverFin||10-10-2000||01:28 PM||stenellas@yahoo.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ctv.es/USERS/stenellas/post-omega_dolphin3.gif">  That "mask" idea was took from Blade Runner movie, when the replicant girl paints herself with a black aerograph.<br>But the yellow-blue stripes idea was from a Manson pic.<p>About my favorite tracks from ecco1 are, the one called "happy city" on the download section of this web, and ice zone (that two from genesis version) and from the cd version, the one called "lonesome search" and "Motion E". I don't know what levels used this music because I played the genesis version, that names are the track names on the Song Of Time cd.

Engough provocative to be killed for some ppl. on his own country.<br>Perhaps someday Manson will be killed. And then, he will become a mith. The mith of a dead star, Just like K.Kobain or just like John Lennon. <br>
Z||000029||Debaser13||10-12-2000||02:19 PM||tonberry101@angelfire.com||Yup. There's a list of all the rumours about Manson that've been circulated in his book : Some of them are weirder than that. <Br> <Br> Kurt Cobain's my favorite artist, as a matter of fact, Silverfin. Nirvana was the best band of the decade ; I <i> worship </i> Nirvana. And of course, John Lennon was amazing too ; if you don't believe me just go listen to "I Am The Walrus". I wonder if Manson will be as legendary as either......<Br>
