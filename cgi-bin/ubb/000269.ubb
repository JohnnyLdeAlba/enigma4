A||||12||PsySonic||Official Ecco The Dolphin Comic from the UK
Z||000000||PsySonic||10-23-2000||09:52 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Hiya all!<p>I finally got a scanned version (or at least the first two parts of it) of the Ecco The Dolphin Comic which was published in the official United Kingdom SEGA Comic "Sonic The Comic". It's pretty cool - The Artwork is fine, though on some panels a bit rubbish, but it's an official Ecco Comic of the first Ecco game on the Genesis/Mega Drive! And for those of you who like to compare every little piece of the comic with the original game will probably get totally mad, because the story is very often changed from the game. But that doesn't mean that it's bad, morely it is still also cool! But look by yourself:<p> <A HREF="http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/stc_scans/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.stas.net/1/stardustway/stc_scans/</A> <p>A BIG THANKS goes to Abigail Ryder because she is the one who scanned this for me!<p>At this time I still only have part 1 and 2, but I will get part 3 tonight so I'll upload it then!<p>Don't get shocked by the size of the first part, it's around 500 KB - that is changed from part 2 on: only around 200 KB!<p><br>Enjoy these scans!<p>-Psy

Z||000009||PsySonic||10-25-2000||09:32 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Eao, you're exaggerating and pulling the comic through dirt! No cookie for you! *Hands a box of cookies to the rest of the gang* - Anyone?<p>Well, don't let yourself get annoyed by the first two parts, they're the only ones who weren't painted by Steve White! Even though I kinda liked the very first page of the story where the Vortex tornado. But that was also the only thing I really liked about Part 1 and 2...<p>And that sure wasn't meant to be a mask cause it's by the Vortex and they wouldn't probably make masks in their freetime... It was probably a machine, but it was totally crap designed and always drawn from a bad perspective<p>By the way: This story ends at Part 6 but Ecco won't get to fight the Vortex till then. Morely he will travel to Atlantis and get tought by glyphs about our nice Aliens. In issue 60 started another Ecco story, called "The Return of Ecco the Dolphin" where he will finally meet the Asterite, fight the Vortex and free all the dolphins! And all that will be drawn and painted by Steve White! So you HAVE something to look forward to!<p>Part 5 will be up tomorrow (hopefully)

I always kinda imagined a tornado when they would mention "Great winds of water"<Br> <Br> But yeah, the later ones look better. Keep 'em coming!
Z||000011||Trace Kyshad||10-25-2000||11:57 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||"The Return of Ecco the Dolphin" - Yeah! I think that's the one I read all of, but I can't remember much about it. I know the one I read had the Asterite in it.<p>I missed a lot of STC issues, so I can't remember very well at all,
Z||000012||PsySonic||10-27-2000||01:57 AM||psysonic@t-online.de||Hello guys!<p>Just wanted to say that Part 5 is online now (after the problems of my server seem to be solved now).<p>So, go and read this part NOW or sit there and stare into the ceiling <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>-Psy
