It gives a command, you see, and is pretty easy to execute.For example, if I want to make a space between my paragraphs, I'll just put >br< for break in there and I can make spaces. But you want the little tags to be inverted, not outward.<Br> <Br> Or if you want to change the colour of your font, you could do something like >font color="red"< <font color="Red"> this, and then all your text is red. When you want to change the color to something else just do the same thing, only put a / in front of it. <Br> <Br> >/font color="red< </font color="red"> <Br> It's kind of complicated, but you get the hang of it. It'll work on any message board that's got HTML capabilities.<Br> <Br> <i> You could do this.....</i> <Br> <Br> <B> Or this......</B> <Br> <Br> <i> <B> <font color="blue"> a combination of things. Experiment!! </i> </B> </font color="blue"> <Br> <Br> But always remember to place the / when you end the tags, else it'll mess up later posts.<Br> <Br> Does that explain anything?

For use with IE and tables... read source to see how!<table>

It consists of a series of words placed between lesser than (&lt<IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> and greater that signs (&gt<IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink">, hope that helps.
