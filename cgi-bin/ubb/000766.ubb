Well, i somehow managed to be fish and swim around just like in that clip. BUT I DONT KNOW HOW!!! I wasnt paying attention to what i was doing...somehting to do with pressing start and moving the analogue stick during the cut scene at the beginning of that level. I havnt been able to duplicate it again...can anyone else?
