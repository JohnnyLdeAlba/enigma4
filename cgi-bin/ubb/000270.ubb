I'm just curious, because it'd be cool to play some when they're done.<p>Second up, if you're needing someone to make music, can I offer my services? I LOVE the ecco music, and because of it have made many many Mids, mainly for Sonic the Hedgehog fangames (Believe me, there's tonnes of them out there), and they're quite good too...<p>Anyway, just asking questions, so answer away please ^^
