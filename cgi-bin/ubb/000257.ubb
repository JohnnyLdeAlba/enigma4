I don't have it done though. I'm still working on it.<br>A the begining of the story Kinko (Ecco's "biggest fan") and Ecco are playing together then all of a sudden Ecco gets knocked out and can't move. Pod members come to his rescue. They push him to the surface to breathe and they notice that Ecco's stars are glowing like fire....<br>That's when the story begins. I'm pretty sure that most of you have read the storyline in the Topic New Game. What do you think of it so far?
