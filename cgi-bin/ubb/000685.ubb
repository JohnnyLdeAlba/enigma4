A||||11||SpiffyKidK||A small question, give some input, please ^^
Z||000000||SpiffyKidK||02-21-2001||01:21 AM||ambaxter@bulldog.unca.edu||Well, I'm new to the board, so I guess asking this question first is prolly annoying... much like how those stupid fish keep going across my screen and making it wider just for a split second...which is really starting to get annoying...but anyway.. ^^    <IMG SRC="smilie43.gif" HEIGHT=25 WIDTH=24 BORDER=0 ALT="silly"> <br>  Recently I've been starting my Ecco the Dolphin remake games. This will include 1&2, and if I get enough help, 3(Windows and Mac ports)<br>Here is my question to everyone:<br>What does everyone think about this? Does everyone just want a straight copy of the game (graphics, sounds levels), or is the general consensus to remake it from the old, or just start from scratch... etc, etc. Blablabla  <IMG SRC="smilie46.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="idea"> <p>I've got DolphinGirl to help. Anyone else want to help?<br>

Or...you don't know yet...cause you want feedback? Heheh!

You can deactivate those animations when you go to the Main Site and click on "Customize". I also deactivated them cause of the same reason. I think for some time they looked nice and stuff, but sometime it gets annoying...<p>But yeah, tell us more about your game! It sounds interesting! It would be cool to see new graphics, but I guess it would be quiet hard to draw all of the hundrets of dolphin sprites... I would love to help you, but actually I still have to work on my project... <i>*shrugs*</i>
Z||000003||SpiffyKidK||02-21-2001||11:13 AM||ambaxter@bulldog.unca.edu||Well, the current plan is to "remake the first two." But the level at which I'll remake it comes up to those who are gonna play it. This will be entirely a fan based game. Do you want completely new 3D modeled creatures, rocks, shells, etc..., or are you happy with the old graphics. Or would you just want to update the old graphics? (By the way, 3D modeled does not mean the game will be in 3D..it just means it'd look completely different)<br>   Currently, I'm starting to update the graphics, especially of Ecco. I wanted him to be visably different from the rest of the dolphins. I should have an animated GIF of his slightly remodeled self by next week or something (depending on HW). All I can get right now is of him swimming (6 sprites), with some help from Blackie.<br>   When I start the story writing, I wanted to include all of those little differences which the fans want. Perhaps the "metal dolphin" from Ecco 2 Beta, different visual effects for time travel, etc. I was even thinking of a partical vortex for Ecco 1. Even inlude the part in origin beach in which you talk with ecco's ancestors.<br>   Finally, I'd like to try and make an ending for what was supposed to be a trilogy. Ecco 3. This will be a full flung fan game. When we get to this point (probably a year or so from now), I will open up a website strictly for fan input, alpha testing (the very buggy first draft of the game),beta testing ..etc...  if I get to it, I'll make the level editor open to the fans and allow fans to create and submit maps. Story lines will be created and evolved by the all powerfull fans as well. <p>Its all up to you guys. I'm just an avatar to the programming, which should start when I recieve my new computer. I'll make it happen, whatever you guys want. Just be a lil considerate and know that the more everyone decides they want in the game, the more time it'll take to write/test/degub it.

C++++++? <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"><p>Anyway, for Graphics, I remember Psy posted up some nifty pics of Ecco for the PC. The Graphics had been improved and upgraded by the looks of things, maybe you should go for that idea.<p>Or if you want to be original and have slightly more work, go for 3D... (What 3D prog do you have? Lightwave? Bryce? 3D Studio Max (the Ultimate IMHO)<p>I think, maybe add some things. If it's EXACTLY the same as the old ones, then there's no fun. Add say... Some hidden levels maybe? Who knows<p>As far as I know, there's only one other Ecco Fangame I know about (I gave up on mine, that Asterite Engine I showed ages ago was pretty much all I managed. The Actualy movement engine was REALLY Buggy). That's that nifty RPG one who's name I forget right now.<p>Anyway, good luck with the project <IMG SRC="smilie11.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="glasses1"> <p>
Z||000005||SpiffyKidK||02-21-2001||12:13 PM||ambaxter@bulldog.unca.edu||The coding program I've decided on using is RealBasic. Yes, it is a Mac based programmer, and don't boo me. I'm extremely novice at C++, even more novice at the complexities of a gaming engine. RealBasic would be kinda like a quickstart, since it has most of the things I will need already built in (graphicwise, soundwise,etc..). Also it has a nifty feature of being able to develop on two platforms at once (Windows and Mac), as opposed to just one. These are the major reasons I chose RealBasic.  <IMG SRC="smilie40.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH=19 BORDER=0 ALT="book"> <br>   For the 3D modeling aspect, I've been playing around with a free program called "Blender" (www.blender.nl). It is very good and effecient. <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  Also its free!! This is good 'cause my computer and other things I will buy this summer will make me hurt for money. The more free stuff, the better. <IMG SRC="smilie16.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="demented"> <br>   For the most part, I want to fix the slightly skewed storyline. This will probably require adding levels in of itself. <br>To what end I update the Ecco games is really up to everyone.<br> <IMG SRC="smilie42.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="rolling"> 
Z||000006||BigBlu5||02-21-2001||02:45 PM||jsklages@cfl.rr.com||I program in Qbasic...<br>I might be able to help, too.  I've got some neat ideas for Ecco 3, like using the Silver Dolphin from the Ecco 2 Beta in one of the levels, a comeback from the vortex, Sonar Charging function, List of Songs, Character switch, The list goes on and on!  I've even designed some of the levels and their maps!<p> <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile">  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin"> <p>
