Ive known longer than you have that you were gonna provate chat her since the lil b**** keeps coming back to the chatroom with her friend who has more of an interest in FF8 than Ecc, and the only reason i ever came to this site was cuz of the ecco the dolphin stuff it had to offer, i can see it coming back but i also see it slowly fading away. <p>Hey, why the hell not just turn it into an Final Fantasy site, i see everyone here liking that alot. Its become one o the obsessions here which triggers the off topic's whick also piss me off. And im tired of the fights and its triggered my anger to where i just dont care.<p>And each time this happens, i get mad then sum mother has to come here and voice there f***ing usless opinions in here.<p>And they're supposed to be nice but they actually turn they're back on you the minute you ditch.<p>And id say that i brought alot to this site, but mainly ofcourse would be the face pics, which seems everyone questioning that im the one to turn to for those, i mean doing those face pics for ppl makes me feel happy when they are pleased with the job i did. It seems that that has fadded too, i wish it was like how it was in the dayz of the old forum. Itsmay have been a broken piece of monkey crap compared to this new one, but atleast it had more civil dignity then the chat and this forum.<p>Each tiem i look at this forum alls i see is bullshit, also, when i see this site i get disgusted with the things that go on in it.<br>blackfin, you were cool and sensible in the ol dayz, i looked up to ya dude, ya had an awesome site that made the ones i used to look at look like crap. But now you need the help of that s*** to keep yer feelings up. And im sorry that yer life did not go the exzact way you wanted it to but you're a pathetic mess and each time you mention megz i am reminded of sumthing Psysonic mentioned:<p>These lil kids inviting they're stupid friends into the site when they have no existing interest in the damn site at all and im sure that sum ppl are getting annoyed with it too. Hey, wheres Miana? I can kinda see why shes not here: SHe couldnt put up with delphi and yogoats nonsense so she left and every once in a while stops by the site, and she was too much of a nice person to be los from this site.<p>Ya feel meh? Im tired of it, and i trigger fights so ya know what, im outta here...Im gonna be at Arkons site and i'll also go back to the sites where i caan persue my passion of drawing in peace.<p>And as for the ppl who wont be missing me, i wont miss you either, fuck the ppl who say that. I wont miss you, and i wish i didnt have to go either, but i dun have much of a choice. And you ppl leave m with no other option...<br>I guess i should say goodbye to my friends...<br>huh? where are my prechious friends now, i guess ive lost more than just my interest...<br>I will say goodbye to the ppl who are nice,<br>Good bye Trace, Coral, Buddy, EccoChick, Yogoat (Ah, hez not soo bad once ya getta know him <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> ) dolphingirl (Why am i saying by to sum of these ppl, yheyre gunna be at Arkon.com once in a while)SilverFin, Psysonic, Reptyx (Yer Art is really cool, its nice to see ppl who are really good at coloring free hand) and i guess i should say by to blackfin, atleast today we had one average conversation today, and i'll give you credit for making the site to our expectations and all. That abou raps it up for me...<br>Farewell....
Z||000001||Buddy||11-30-2000||07:26 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Bye Crestoe.<br>I know how you feel.My sister and I are getting sick of these fights.<br>Another person is probaly going to leave too.<IMG SRC="frown.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="frown"> 
Z||000002||dragonboy||11-30-2000||08:13 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||well i'll miss ya.  but i know you'll be back when something about ecco 2 comes out.  i think this site has been great since the first day i've been here, and the reason why there are so many off-topic posts is that since there so many people, some people say something interesting in on e of the posts they put uop and then another person responds to the post that was in response to another post...phew!  its a lot like how the human mind works, weird correlations and jumping from one thought to the next. i think its nice how so many of us can feel comfortable enough to talk just about anything and everything.  unless you wish to talk about how you think ecco is sexy and that you wouldn't mind makung,ove to a dolphin, there really is not much more we can say about ecco.  i have been having trouble compliling data about dolphins because there is so much out there, i can't keep up.  so i will help keep the spirit of dolphins alive by giving some information on them.  but i like talking with everyone here about, whether it be in forum posts or in chat.  oh and crest, i didn't know you had such a dislike to me.  How come you never said anything to me in chat?  i can take criticism, i encourage it in fact.  it may help me be a better person.  well, everyone out there, whether it be about ecco, final fantasy, or how your brother is chewing his toenails, it's still conversation and despite what a few say about the off-topic posting and such, just know that we all know each other a bit more to say that we aren't complete strangers.  that's what i think the beauty of the internet really is, the coming together of different people from around the world and the joy of communicating in the press of a button.  so there really is nothing to criticize.  we come together under the name of ecco, and leave with the knowledge of others as our own.

Damn you frickin people, for running off one of my favoritest people on this site!!! <IMG SRC="smilie4.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=15 BORDER=0 ALT="very mad"> Can't you people quit bullshitn' around! GEEEESH!!! Crestoe...I'm not sayin goodbye, cause I'll see you around else where...a place where things are a hell of a lot better than they are here!!! <IMG SRC="wink.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="wink"> Oh, and LionHeart/Lionfin, whatever the hell your name is...are you even a frickin ecco fan, or are you just a FF fan?!? If the later is true...what the hell are you doing here?!?! Now, if you are an ecco fan...I sure as hell hope you won't just be posting shit about FF! <i>*dolphingirl is fuckin mad now...she storms outa this hell hole!!!*</i>
Z||000006||blackfin||11-30-2000||10:05 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||*sigh* Bye Crestoe
Z||000007||yogoat||11-30-2000||11:10 PM||rotten_yogurt@hotmail.com||man, dolphingirl, you gotta buy some nicoderm CQ, for methinks you need a smoke, and bad...people that have not ever heard of ecco are welcome to this site..we scarcely talk about Ecco anyway.  But man, Crestoe, yer leavin?!  Why the hell isn't it someone else...like Arkonviox?!  Hm...Well, I'll see you 'round, man.  In fact, I'm goin' to Arkonviox's site, I think you're essential to this website..like cherries in a cherry pie, without the cherries..it's a pie.  So, if you don't mind, I'll follow you!
Z||000008||Debaser13||12-01-2000||03:47 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||*Throws herself screaming on the post*<p>Oh woe is me, woe is <i>meeee!!</i> How shall we EVER get along without them?!! I do believe I shall faint dead away and die from sadness that you two are leaving -- how will the site go on? After all, it IS run by Crestoe, right? <p>...........<p>Or not. For you see, some people seem to have forgotten whom this site is run by, or that it's a personal site -- no obligation to keep it up; I assume he does it because it used to be fun. <p>And just because people leave the forum dosen't mean it's going to drop dead. Hell, he could remove the forum and this would still be a heavily-visited site, since it's the only good, authentic page that provides Ecco information out there. <p>And I doubt that half the visitors that would come by would care a whit if there was a forum or not.<p>So life goes on, as the song says. If you don't agree, feel free to use this handy funeral pyre I've constructed on-site. Chow!!
Z||000009||blackfin||12-01-2000||04:03 AM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Thanks Debaser as per usual you've hit the nail right on the head. 
Z||000010||Trace Kyshad||12-01-2000||08:00 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||Hmm, I've never been good at replying to MB leavings, You're right about the whole FF thing, I agree there's getting to be more FF than Ecco...<br>Things have been kinda rough and indeed messy past few weeks, but I figured they'd improve. I don't really know the people here well enough to say much, but I know yeh were a damn fine artist.<p>Miss ya!<br>
Z||000011||blackfin||12-01-2000||02:13 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Indeed things will get better, once I get things finished at the end of the year things will be under much more control, currentlly I want to delete anything I have to manually edit the forum configuartions files - needless to say it makes be less than inclined to take action except on something very very serious...
Z||000012||Arkonviox||12-01-2000||02:58 PM||arkonviox@arkonviox.com|| <IMG SRC="http://arkonviox.com/artwork/faarkon.gif">  Debaser we'll just see about that when I finaly leave! Which will me never Mwa ha ha ha ha! be honest Crestoe will be better off in my world and two just you wait when I too hold alot of my knowledge of authentic ecco info yeah I plan to add plenty myself because I am gonna redesign my site for when it comes up in searches!<p>But you know what Crestoe has done alot for everyone and is he says something he's not bullshitting! He has other places he goes to so this wont be a major loss for him...but I believe he contributed alot to this forum far beyound anyrthing you ever contributed! What have you done for us a couple of fan ficts thats all good said and done but hes designed over 30 face ficts for this forum! and I think thats way more than you could ever accomplish ever! So next time you saying something like "oh big loss" well guess what it is a big loss when you noticed this place slowly becomes very lonly and about nothing but final fantasy or anything that drains the ecconess of this site Screw You Im going home!

You've been here very long, and it was your artwork in the fanart section that inspired me to submit my first pic.<p>Your face pics are very cool, I hope you'll change your mind and stay here and make more of 'em. They add so much life and color to this site. I could never make face pics like you...
Z||000015||EccoChick||12-01-2000||04:24 PM||gooseu2@msn.com||Awwwwwwwww  bye crestoe. You ARE still gonna chat  right?   Well at least Arkonviox is staying.    Sorry to see you go  but i will see you at arkon's site.    
Z||000016||blackfin||12-01-2000||10:34 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Arkonviox, you may not intend on leaving but if you don't keep your ego in check you may be leaving the hard way.  You say you think you've done good for the forum?  I think you've done a huge amount of damage as well.....  I don't like having to say things like that but I'm losing my patience.

Z||000018||EccoChick||12-02-2000||04:10 PM||gooseu2@msn.com||Blackfin , no offence really , but you did start some yourself.    So dont kick people off your site, that would be a big kaboom! heh c-ya <br>The Cutist Chick Under The Sea- EccoChick
Z||000019||blackfin||12-02-2000||06:01 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I did start something but I stopped when I relised how bad it was and did my best to fix things up, Arkon doesn't do that he just keeps going and going....
