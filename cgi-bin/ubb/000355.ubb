Her name on her papers is actually Tam O' Shanter, but that was a bit of a mouthful, so we just call her Mollie. All her ancestors were skilled sheepdogs. Two of them were international sheepdogs champions, and one was worth $5,000.00 <br> <br> And she really thinks SHE is a sheepdog. When she was a puppy, she'd stalk and try to "herd" me around the couch -- it was So cute. Now that she's older, she thinks her ball is a sheep and keeps a close eye on it.<br> <Br> Yes, I am proud of my dog <IMG SRC="smile.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="smile"> <Br>

Cute doggie, the dog I have think's he's a SHEEP never mind a sheep dog, he started with a smooth coat as a puppy, but he kinda.... exploded outwords and spends most time lying on the couch demanding 100% attention from everyone in the room...<br>
