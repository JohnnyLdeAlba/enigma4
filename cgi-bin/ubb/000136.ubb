Z||000002||Bloodfin||09-26-2000||11:22 PM||bloodfin@prodigy.net||No,no,no. That was me, I found your sailor delphinus site on geocities when i was creating my anime site. I found the site and said 'Hi!' and then she wanted to know how i found her email and you know the rest. I was wondering why you were mads at me then i finally  got it, and what an idiot i feel like, now that i understand...uh...My bad.
Z||000003||Delphi||09-26-2000||11:58 PM||vampirekiwi@hotmail.com||Okay, I get it.<br>Gotcha!
Z||000004||Bloodfin||09-27-2000||12:34 AM||bloodfin@prodigy.net||Yeah, thats what you said in the Chatroom. I had to watch Arkonviox/Darkorca/seaman/which is it now Gianni, ralk to blackfin and every one else. Sharing his computer sucks.

Z||000006||Cell||09-27-2000||06:56 PM||ssjevot@hotmail.com||Game making isn't to bad you just need patience.  I got an unfinished Mario game, Sonic game, and Gundam game(not Wing the old U.C. ones from the 60's).
