If you ever met me before when I was around alot you'd know I am one to always say something smart assed!<p>I did'nt want to make you mad, I own horses myself!<p>But besides this I here your leaving and theres only one thing I got to say "why?"<p>Why are you gonna let all these sissys who constantly whine about themselves keep you from having a good time? You know all i ever noticed is people who care nothing but themselves everywhere I went! In my real life I tried so hard to please a nice beatiful girl but she'd always throw my to the side like I was some shitty meat! everyone thinks I'm always a jerk someone who doesnt care about nobody and is out for himself to be come big and conquere the world.<p>Most of that is true but One thing isnt and that is I care about more people than myself and if it wasnt for you my forum wouldnt have any visitors! You always made my forum interesting and I know I havent been around much to talk with you guys or anyone in the chat for that matter! I have had such a busy life with working all the time and my stress that I hadn't had time for myself or my site! I work so extra hard just to keep my site appealing it's so hard not having free time! <p>Blackfin I know many think was weak because he liked megz at one time i did to! and I blame myself and crestoe for being the fire to all these fights! mainly crestoe I wanted to make a point in my posts though! I just wanted to point out what people looked like!<br>Blackfin though I have always had respect for even though my brother didnt because he works hard to keep his site interesting he works hard to ensure were all happy and works hard on many different levels! Even though we have 50 chat operators he didnt do it for his depression he did it to ensure everyone was happy and has been trying to do it since he started this site!<p>You know what else is funny some people dont like to see others in love they believe it weakens them! Everytime I get into a relationship crestoe thinks i become a total fruit when I dedicated myself to someone I relly want to please!<p>But..Coral back to my point If you leave then I'm leaving as well and never coming back but I don't want to I have such good friends here like you buddy dolphingirl blackfin dragonboy eccochick psysonic silverfin and alot of people I have learned alot from! It's because of this site and blackfins help I've had so much success in building mine and crestoe too who my site is probably dedicated to! You know if it werent for him I would not be arkonviox because he created the name and character!<p>Coral please give this a second thought! I dont want another friend to leave and never return like blackfins old forum when many of the old regulars couldnt make it here! <p>

His name was the best name to ever sound like Budweiser...*Tear rolls down face* *Sniff, Sniff*<br>Plus we got to have all the Original peoples here!!!
Z||000007||Coral||11-26-2000||07:45 AM||ntraver@epix.net||You guys are making me cry!
Z||000008||Buddy||11-26-2000||07:56 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Hi Ecco the Barbarian! Stop calling me that!<br>I hate beer! It tastes like pee! Not that I had pee before, but I think that's what it tastes like.
Z||000009||Coral||11-26-2000||07:59 AM||ntraver@epix.net||That didn't last long did it? I've only been gone for a day and you guys want me to come back!
Z||000010||Trace Kyshad||11-26-2000||09:28 AM||fussenpepper@hotmail.com||If there's one thing about message boards, its VERY hard to leave them. I've seen people try, only to return a day later saying they couldn't possibly. One reason is all the people, you'll miss 'em and you'll miss replying to things.<p>Another is the fact what's just happened, everyone wants you back. No one on this board wants any one to leave, I once saw a massiva long 75 reply post about someone leaving, in the end they didn't because the whole board wouldn't let him... ^^<p>Anyway, of course we want you to come back. We didn't want you to go away in the first place <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="stick out tounge">
Z||000011||Buddy||11-26-2000||12:11 PM||ntraver@epix.net||CORAL!!!Wait till I get my hands on you! Barbar I'm not really leaving ok? Coral wrote my message.( I wrote this message at my friend's house)
Z||000012||Coral||11-26-2000||12:22 PM||ntraver@epix.net||That's what you would say though! <br>
Z||000013||Buddy||11-26-2000||12:26 PM||ntraver@epix.net||I know Coral, but you promist not to write under my name!
Z||000014||blackfin||11-26-2000||01:35 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Yup
Z||000015||Coral||11-26-2000||01:37 PM||ntraver@epix.net||Alright! Fine! <br>Hey Buddy! Ricky Ticky is here! He's sleeping on your bed right now. He's so cute!

Z||000018||Coral||11-27-2000||08:06 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Yeah I guess so. I wasn't bored abotu not going here because I went on Debaser's forum and Cid Highwind's forum or Rocket town. Something like that.<br>Arkon, I least expected you to write this topic. I thought you were gonna say something like "See what I care." or something. Yes, you can be a smart ass sometimes and I can be too. <p><br><i>"Oh c'mon! You're honer! How can it be proved that the male voice on that tape is not Mr. Cole himself?! *voice on tape* You're such a better lover than my husband! Oh my-. You're honer, I object! And why is that Mr. Reed? Because its devestating to my case! Over ruled! Good call!"</i><br>-Liar Liar
Z||000019||Debaser13||11-27-2000||10:11 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||Shera's Kitchen, the forum at Rocket Town. You're quite welcome to stay if you'd like; it's odd to see someone from another forum amongst all my old friends.<p><i> My </i> forum, on the other hand, is already going back to it's usual catonic state. Ahh well.
Z||000020||Coral||11-27-2000||10:49 AM||ntraver@epix.net||Yeah that's it. I keep forgeting!<br>Your forum doesn't have many on it. I can be on the computer all day waiting for a reply but nobody does. Well, except you.<p><i>"What the hell are you doing? I'm kickin' my ass! Do ya mind?!"</i>
Z||000021||Debaser13||11-27-2000||10:57 AM||u_hrair@hotmail.com||That's because noone ever shows up ~_~<p>*Sigh* I used to have friends that posted there. Maybe if I yell at them they'll come back. Only logical.
Z||000022||dragonboy||11-27-2000||03:21 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||good coral!!! i'd miss you.  but as mentioned before, symptoms like this are only the cause of discontent.  we must do our part in the name of peace.  we must ignore the ignorance and start working towards a better forum and chat.
