Z||000000||Newbie Dolphin||12-30-2000||10:31 PM||dant_10@hotmail.com||Newbie question: I've got Ecco, and I got to level 2.  I talk to the dolphins and they challenge me to a race, and say "catch a red fish and start at the third whistle".  I'm SO confused.  I keep catcing the red fish, but I don't know how to start the race. I never hear a whistle, much less a third whistle.  Now all red fish are gone!  Help!  Can someone walk me through with details?!? Thanks

You should hear them whistle three times and then the race starts, if you can heard them just wait untill you start to swim and start then...

Z||000004||Newbie Dolphin||01-02-2001||03:22 AM||dant_10@hotmail.com||OK, I caught the fish, and then the game takes me to the "start" of the race.  The race starts, but now I lose every time.  Do I have to swim fast (hit the paddle button), or do I win by hitting the charge button (button B on my Dreamcast?) ?
Z||000005||blackfin||01-02-2001||12:54 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||I'd have to say charging to start and then hitting the paddle button lots after that to keep up speed works well for me, but practice is really just the best way to win.
Z||000006||Delphi||01-02-2001||03:14 PM||sailordelphi@hotmail.com||My trick was that as soon as I heard the first whistle, I instantly hit the charge button to give myself some distance, then just kept charging the whole way around. When you want to turn, it's probably easier just to swim fast.

Z||000010||vantid||01-05-2001||09:00 AM||||Hey that part ticked me off, too, Newbie. I was wondering if anyone had any of these glitches in their Ecco<IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15 BORDER=0 ALT="big grin">otf games. After being sent back to Perils of Reef from 4-ways of mystery, has anyone tried to swim dack down that hole? When I do, everything but Ecco changes to a bright fuchsia. I swam around a bit in this pink world uyntil a came to the "surface" and found that I was outside the level, or inside the rocks. I could see sharks and and dolphins on the other side. A similar thing happened on roaring forces. After reaching the peg puzzle after the eel chase, I turned around and sang to the pile of rocks where the eel was trapped. The game took over then and made me swim straight back to the pool with all the sharks at the beginning. Straight back--even through the rocks and outside the level like the other glitch. Well, I swam back through the tunnel at my leisure. When I reached the end of the tunnel, there were 2 eels lined up just kinda swimmin'. They were harmless and I could swim right through them.  Anyway, I know this is real long but I am really curious about this.

Well, it also happened to me sometimes that a tube in the "Tranquility" levels was suddenly slighty moved at one part and I got either stuck there or could swim "out of it" and also watch the level from outside of the actual area and everything got dark or pink around it... I was kind of annoyed when that happened to me in "Four Ways of Mystery" cause that level was so big... Anyway, those are only bugs and no special features in the game (how I guess) so don't mind about those... ^_^

Z||000013||blackfin||01-06-2001||05:10 PM||blackfin@ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz||Why don't I ever see these bugs???  The worst I've ever got is getting stuck in a wall a few times, why do I always miss the cool stuff......
Z||000014||PsySonic||01-07-2001||04:45 AM||psysonic@t-online.de|| <IMG SRC="http://www.crosswinds.net/~stardustspeedway/psysonic.jpg"> <br>Hehehe, Blackie! I guess you have to try a little more to let the game make annoying stupid things ^_^<p>Yeah Rep, tell us about your experiences and adventures in bugs in Ecco DotF ^_^ I've never seen flying turtles... Where are those? And how do I get them? I think you should start a new thread when you are writing about this... This one is getting to big ^_^
Z||000015||Delphi||01-07-2001||01:01 PM||sailor_delphi13@hotmail.com||I've really had no problems with Defender of the Future yet. (knocks on wood) But my friend was playing once in Aquamarine Bay and Ecco got sucked into and stuck in a rock... then he drowned...
Z||000016||Reptyx||01-07-2001||04:17 PM||reptyx@hotmail.com|| <IMG SRC="http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/dolphin_reptyx_h.jpg"> <p>Okay, here goes! ^_^<p>The flying turtles: you just push a turtle straight up through the surface, and it'll hover there, happily floating in thin air, like some Great A'Tuin wannabe.<p>The bug I've suffered worst from is connected to the Great White on level 2. If you lurk inside a hole, eventually it will push itself into the hole and get stuck, but the only things you find in its mouth are as usual just a lot of teeth and a quick way to become shark chow. It looks pretty buggy when it flails right through the solid rock, but I thought, what the hey, perhaps they couldn't do it better than that, so I kept on trying for a couple of weeks before I got it right.<p>The game has hanged a few times, sometimes so bad you have to restart the Dreamcast. Sometimes Ecco freezes while the rest of the game continues, so you have to wait until you run out of air.<p>Ending up on the wrong side of the walls has happened to me too, of course. The first time was on Roaring Forces when I was in fish shape so I couldn't just wait and die, I had to restart the level.<p>Some small things, like baby turtles and transculent jellyfish, swing around when you turn, so it's hard to shake them out of your field of vision.<p>Sometimes the music stops and all you hear is a faint weird noise.<p>If you try to tail-walk in the pools of Hanging Waters, you'll get a splashing noisy camera-shaking chaos. (I thought dolphins were supposed to elegantly cut through the water surface, not bounce off it! o_O)<p>That's all I can think of for now. I really think they should've done some more testing before they released it, they shouldn't have given my Ecco-hating brother an opportunity to point out how buggy it is... ^^;<br>

Z||000018||Histronic||01-07-2001||06:42 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard"> One time, I was in Entrapment, and the clannie biffed me outside the level and I couldn't get in.<br>Another thing is, you can look through the window in entrapment, and you can see the dolphins talking.  Whe you enter the room, it happens again.
Z||000019||Histronic||01-07-2001||08:32 PM||john__cool@hotmail.com||<IMG SRC="http://histronic.tripod.com/signiturelizard.gif">I tried that eel thingy.  After the cut scene took me back to the main pool, I went through the place again.  There was no music or eel chasing me.  I could turn around and explore the whole tunnel - I had 360 degree movement.  I swam right up to the harmless eels.  I came to the conclusion that the first one (farthest from the rocks) is the one that chases you, for some reason now harmless.  The second eel is the one that gets a face full of avalanche.  (You can clip through them and such, meaning that there is still some research to be done on the subject.)  The change in camera when Ecco avoids the avalanche disguises this.  By the way, using two identical objects for different purposes is more popular than you think, as it has been demonstrated in Sonic and Knuckles.  If you put this on your Interesting things page, Blackie, remember you heard it here first.
