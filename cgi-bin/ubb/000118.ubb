I mean, just look at the topics that have over 10 posts.  A lot of those replies aren't even related to the topic!  Mr. Hat is a new guy, so if he sticks around, I'm sure we'll know more about him.  It would help if he signed the guestbook or put some more info about himself.

Sheess talk about it, I used to know everybody's nick and their details off my heart, not much chance of doing that now...

I'll see what I can do. Anyway about me. I'm just a guy living in California. I want to work in the video game industry(I already have three game ideas, but they're still rather incomplete) and I'd like to be a comic book artist. Sure I'm only 13 now, but thats what I want to do for a living. I buy only Sega. I particularly like Sonic the Hedgehog, The Panzer Dragoon series on the Saturn(will the story ever continue?)and now, Ecco the Dolphin.<p>Blackfin I DID sign the guestbook.
