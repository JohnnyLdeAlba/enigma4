A||||3||dragonboy||the songs of ecco versus the play of ecco
Z||000000||dragonboy||09-09-2000||06:30 PM||returner8@hotmail.com||one of the previous posts brought a question to my mind.  What if the music to the ecco games was bad.  How much less would you like the ecco games, if at all?  I bought ecco for genesis the second i heard it was out and I loved it.  then I got a sega cd and decided to rent ecco for that.  I was blown away with its musical score and immedietely bought it that night at a nearby store.  I then sold the genesis one.  Ever since then i have had high expectations for all all folowing ecco games.  Tides of time and DOTF have not let me down.  Bu I am  left to wonder, would I play these games as much if they had bad soundtracks? <br>

Don't worry about you communicative skills, we have pepole here from around the world and we do our best to understand each other because we care what everyone has to say.  This the best ecco site I have ever known.
