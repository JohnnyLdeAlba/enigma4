Hello I don't have a real name instead I'm a guy from some boring state like Michigan who goes to college with two room mates, one probably Asian and a guy, the other probably a gay guy with a Mohawk. My major is going to college indefinably until my student loans wear out. I live off pizza and go under the name Tails69, I choose tails as my online characture<!wiki comment='characture not a typo'> even though I'm obviously a male. Some say I got a gender identity crisis others say I'm just plain gay, I mean we are the company we keep; whatever that's suppose to mean.

<p>I started researching the Ecco One ROM when all my friends went to a party without me. I popped some of my Asian roommates acid or the gay Mohawk roommate , and started tripping serious balls. After hours of looking at preteen boy child porn I started to play Ecco. Because I was so high off acid I noticed I had the ability to hack programs. I hacked Ecco trying to put a penis on the sprite but ended up stumbling upon the inner workings of the ROM. From this point on as long as I have enough college loan left and as long as I got my room mates acid I became an avid researcher of Ecco One paraphernalia.</p>

AssCore is against this because his obsessive compulsive disorder states
that if Ecco has a penis so should the Asterite. AssCore says if someone could edit a penis on the Asterite then this picture will give him a hard on.

I added that article with Arlistor because I realize I'm the most boring member on this website and I got nothing really worth researching. I do want a hand at AssCore's Ecco ROM 8472 but he won't release it cause it probably doesn't exist. My theories are he found the jellyfish sprite with the different shaded pixel and the hidden Easter egg message from Ecco's Finnish developers that says "I IS R ROBOTO MR. JERBOTO." which might be a pop culture reference of how the Finnish hate black people. Since I don't have anything useful to say I'm just gonna waste article space talking about chilies balls and how I wish I were an Oscar Meyer wiener.
