<b>Access Tmachine, The Pod, Vortex Arrived and Selection Src.</b>

<div id='caption'>
<center>
<img src='../eccoserv/screenshots/ecco-2-time-machinex200.gif' />
</center>
<br />
Tmachine is the scene at the end of the game where Ecco uses the time machine and vanishes into the tides of time.
</div>

<br />
To access Tmachine, The Pod, Vortex Arrived and Selection Scr from the cheat menu, modify the teleportation x or y coordinates then hit start. If the code was done correctly you will teleport into the level you selected. These levels are all for cinematic sequences throughout the game where Ecco can only be controlled by the cpu. The only level that is different from the others is selection scr which takes you to the password and game mode selection screen.
<p>The Tmachine level is the scene in the game where Ecco uses the time machine to disappear into the tides of time. You can activate the time machine by entering the cheat mode and changing the x or y teleport coordinates. After hitting start Ecco will teleport in front of the time machine and automatically use his sonar which will cause the time machine to activate and go to the ending epilogue.</p>
Vortex Arrived is not a level the Ecco sprite is suppose to be apart of. This level or scene was for the begining prologue where the vortex Queen falls from the night sky into the sea. The Pod is the scene after defeating the Vortex Queen during the celebration sequence. The game will freeze if you go to far off the level map. An interesting note about this level is how the blue whales show up on the sonar map without a sprite. If you bring up the sonar map they will appear as big dark shadows. The reason for this is they are apart of the background and are not actual sprites like everything else that moves in the game.

<b>Dolphin Show.</b>

Take control of the dolphin show near the end of the game.
</div>

<br />
To take control of the dolphin show scene after defeating the Vortex Queen near the end of the game, wait until the three dolphins move in front of you and enter the cheat mode. You can only do this cheat so many times during game play. While in the cheat mode hit C and Start to restart the level. When you press A for the sonar three dolphins will swim past you. If you swim towards the current, you'll get followed by four dolphins.
<p>To control your sonar enter the cheat mode and change the x and y teleport coordinates greater then the width and height of the level. If you are already accompanied by four dolphins, using the sonar map will cause four more dolphins to follow. The more dolphins you add the slower the game will become and dolphin sprites will start disappearing. If you enter and leave the cheat mode you will get a strange palette bug.</p>

<b>Play as a dolphin on Fish City or Innuendo.</b>

<div id='caption'>

<br />
On the level Innuendo take a look at the sonar map to see how the level structure forms a smiley face.
</div>

<br />
To play as Ecco in Innuendo or Fish City quickly make Ecco face the screen right before he touches the metasphere and enter the cheat mode. Change the teleport x and y values to place Ecco in a different location. Hit start and Ecco will teleport into the level as a dolphin.
<p>On the level Fish City you can fight fellow dolphins but they cannot fight you back. You can also bring up sonar maps of the level allowing you to see where your enemies are and understand the level structure. On the level Innuendo you will notice the sonar map has enemies and metaspheres that are mapped onto the level forming a smiley face, with the metaspheres forming the eyes.</p>

<b>Baby orcas fall from the sky.</b>

<div id='caption'>
<center>
<img src='../eccoserv/screenshots/ecco-2-baby-orcasx200.png' />
</center>
<br />
Everytime you enter your sonar map more orcas begin to fall.
</div>

<br />
On the level The Lost Orcas there is a way to make baby orcas fall from the sky. To do this you must bring at least two orcas back to their mother. Once you do this you must go into the far upper left of the level near the surface and enter your sonar map. When you get out of the sonar map two orcas will fall from the sky. Depending on how many orcas you rescued determines how many will fall but each time you enter the sonar map more and more will fall out of the sky.
<p>The orcas fall from the sky due to a bug in the game that confuses the orcas variable location when ever the map is brought up. Bringing more orcas from the sky causes a certain amount of orcas to vanish. If you leave that location and go back the orcas will be gone. The orcas that fall will not follow you but will swim back and forth and eventually get stuck facing the surface.</p>

<b>Strange giant whale.</b>

<div id='caption'>

<br />
Enter the sonar map and look towards the bottom.
</div>

<br />
On the level Big Water enter the sonar map to find a giant whale at the bottom of the screen. You will notice compared to the other blue whale sprites this whale is huge and black. The reason for this bug probably had something to do with the fact that you never actually see more then one blue whale on screen at a given time. Because the blue whales in the level are apart of the background the sonar map creates this silhouette. Each strategic point causes the whale to rise and say something different but to the play a different whale rises even though its the same whale.
<p>Looking at the sonar map you will see little blue whales and the one giant blue whale and this is because the little blue whales represent points to cause the big battleground blue whale to rise and say something different.</p>

<b>The Hunter Song.</b>

<div id='caption'>
<center>
<img src='../eccoserv/screenshots/ecco-2-hunter-songx200.gif' />
</center>
<br />
The hunter's song comes in handy in the 3D stages.
</div>

<br />
On the level The Secret Cave you will find a glyph that tells you to "Find the magic arm" what its referring to is the creature in the cave that gives off bubbles as you attack it with your charge sonar. To use the charge sonar hit the button to make Ecco use his charge then right before Ecco attacks hit the sonar button. This will cause the creature to give off bubbles which you want to collect. Go back to the glyph at the beginning of the level so it can confirm you have the hunter's song.
<p>The hunter's song can only be used in the 3D stages but come in very handy for attacking and nuisance sharks that are very difficult to get past.</p>

<b>Japanese epilogue.</b>

<br />
The Japanese version of Ecco 2 The Tides of Time has a different epilogue.
</div>

<br />
The Japanese version of Ecco 2 The Tides of Time has a different epilogue from the American version. Thanks to reptyx we have a translation giving us a little more clues as to what exactly happened to Ecco at the end of the game:

<i><p>Epilogue</p>
At the end of a long journey, Ecco found the time machine at last.
If he destroys the machine, everything ends.
<p>...will it really end?...</p>
He remembers Asterite's words...
<p>His existence is a juncture of time.</p>
He remembers his dolphin-friends' words...
<p>The marks on his head are a sign of his destiny.</p>
...will it really end?...
<p>He would finish everything but found one way...</p>
Instead of destroying the time machine Ecco opened a door of time and disappeared into the tides of time forever...</i>
