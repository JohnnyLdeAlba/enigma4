In 1992 Novatrade International released Ecco the Dolphin for the 16-bit Sega Genesis and Megadrive. An 8-bit version was released for the Game Gear and Master System consoles. Since its introduction the 16-bit Ecco the Dolphin classic has been ported to various other platforms.

<p>The game revolves around a young bottlenose dolphin named Ecco, who loses his family to a mysterious storm. His quest leads him to search for his family through the dangerious open ocean to the cold artic sea. He meets an old and wise blue whale called Big Blue who tells him the storm is an unnatural event that occurs once every 500 years.</p>

Following the Big Blue's advice Ecco searches for the older and wiser Asterite who communicates through a "great energy of thought". Venturing deep beneath the ocean, the Asterite lights its cave with its double helix of colorful, glowing paired globes.

<p>Upon meeting Ecco, the Asterite gives him a strange impression that they met before. The Asterite offers to help Ecco by giving him power and knowledge in exchange for retrieving his missing globe from the past. He tells him to find the sunken city Atlantis where he will find a functional time machine he must use to travel back 55 million years.</p>

When Ecco finds the sunken city he discovers glyphs created by the Altanteans with encoded messages. It is through these glyphs Ecco learns the true nature of the 500 year storm that was also responsible for leaving Atlantis in ruins. The messages left by the Altanteans tell of a planet called Vortex that can no longer produce food. Every 500 years when Earth and Vortex have a clear path the Vortex feed upon it, with each feeding increasing in size.

<p>Using a song given to him by the Asterite, Ecco uses it to activate the time machine. When he arrives in the past, Ecco encounters his dry land dwelling ancestors and mistakenly leads them back to the ocean. He finds a dangerous and aggressive Asterite whom he attacks to retrieve the missing globe. Upon retrieval a vortex of time opens returning Ecco and the missing globe back to the present. Ecco returns the missing globe back to the Asterite who grants him power and sends him back to Atlantis.</p>

Finding the Atlantean time machine Ecco uses it to travel to the hour of the storm. He follows his family as they get swept away into an artificial tunnel with machines. The tunnel or tube takes Ecco to the hive where he comes into contact with aggressive Vortex lifeforms. Fighting his way through the dangerous Vortex, he eventually makes his way into the Queen's chamber. With the power the Asterite has given him Ecco defeats the Queen freeing his family from her stomach and escapes through the tube back to Earth.
