I should explain this picture, someone gave me this PC that had an Ecco prototype in it. I am trying to take it out and also make my website's forum work. I work in my underwear cause I can use my pasty white skin to document things I normally couldn't on paper.

Hi my name is Devon Galleo also known as AssCore. I am currently stationed in Japan patrolling for underage prostitutes, which are legal here! I am not trying to arrest anyone as long as they can cooperate with an over weight lonely guy who has never had sex with anyone, unless you count my left hand while in my grandma's basement. 

<p>I am also the biggest collector of Ecco the Dolphin crap. I've done everything you can think of just to obtain an Ecco prototype and boy does my ass hurt! I won't even tell you how I obtained my nickname but you can guess I probably got it while obtaining an Ecco prototype.</p>

I don't have a girlfriend since I'm obsessive compulsive, I don't regularly bathe cause anyone who owns a massive multiplayer Ecco the Dolphin solo masterbative website doesn't have time for such things.

<p>Although the Mighty Arkonviox says I'm gay I can pridefully say the ugliest transvestite of all of Texas won't touch me, which makes me feel really lonely. Luckily I have my crafty dual core Athlon with a liquid lubrication system to keep me <span style='text-decoration:line-through;'>on my feet</span> in my seat.</p>

Here is the post of the day on my progress:
"We're currently working on documenting the Ecco prototype-alpha-8172.(I meant me since no one else is really working on this project. I mean if there was more person then just me I would have had this stupid article posted on the website 3 months ago.) So far I noticed one jellyfish with one pixel that's slightly different from the jellyfishes from the final, probably from JPEG artifacts oh wait the Genesis doesn't use JPEG I must make something up from some Sega Dev Article to make me look smart. Okay...I think it comes from PALLIRAW artifacts. Thanks to the joint partnership with hidden palace: a one page sonic the hedgehog website that i co own and no one visits, and also thanks to assscore-gaming.usa: another website I own but never update, and also thanks to another website I own but never update for the sake of making it seem like I have real affiliates. We will be releasing the source code to the header of Ecco the Dolphin One Renegade Edition."

<p>Here is an update on the progress of Ecco portal: Added one link Mighty Arkonviox.com and Caverns of Dope Ass Dolphins. I would of added all the useless sites I co own and never update but the Mighty Arkonviox said that would be stupid. Oh yeah Ecco portal is still not done and um...yeah I'm really busy documenting and writing down excuses of how my military job keeps me way to busy.</p>

That's it for this weekend expect more next weekend (or next year depending on how japan time affects you.) AssCore out!
