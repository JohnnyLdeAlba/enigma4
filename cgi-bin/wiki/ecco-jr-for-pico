<p>The Sega Pico was a gaming console designed for young
children. The games came in the form of "Storyware" which were books that
interact with your child. Turning the page in the book changed what was
displayed on the screen. The system came out during a time when the game rating
system was first introduced.</p>

<p>A port of the Genesis Ecco Jr. was released for the Sega
Pico that featured new levels. The game had a new title to differentiate itself
from its Genesis counterpart "Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt!" You
complete each level and advance to the next with a new set of puzzles to solve.
Each level involved finding certain types of fish, searching for treasure and
identifying colors and music tones. The purpose behind each level was to help
develop your child's memorization skills.</p>

<p>There were mini games that taught your child how to play
music by identifying musical jellyfishes. Certain jellyfish would light up and
your child had to respond by touching the key that represented that jellyfish.
The Genesis version had a level that involved going through musical rings to
produce song pieces. Other games your child could play in the Pico version of
Ecco Jr. involved counting and math. Your child could learn basic arithmetic by
counting and grouping objects.</p>

<p>Ecco Jr. may have had voice compatibility where the system
could talk to your child as he or she played. Voice compatibility was a known
feature among Sega Pico Storyware games.</p>

<p>Things that are the same among the Genesis counterparts are
still the same in the Pico version. You play as a dolphin in the same
highflying adventures of living in the sea and communicating with other
species. The game like the Genesis version must of came packed with all sorts
of facts about different types of sea life like Orcas and fish.</p>

<p>The game was designed for young children in mind and
although older players are a level beyond that there isn't much to learn but it
is still fun to play.</p>
