<p style='font-weight:bold;'>Lets start off with some general facts:</p>

<img src='../eccoserv/dads/dolphinfacts/heading.gif'/>
<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod1_handle');">
"Can Dolphins talk?"</a>

<div id='factiod1_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>Dolphins have their own unique and complex language. This consists mainly of sound (squeaks, whistles, clicks etc.) but aside from this they can also use their flippers and tails to slap the water, and their body posture and jaw movement to communicate. Studies have shown that dolphins are capable of understanding a structured language, like our own, studies also show that a dolphin’s vocalization is complex enough to some form of language.</p>

<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod2_handle');">
"If dolphins have to breath air, how can they sleep?"</a>

<div id='factiod2_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>Well as stated by Williams et al, 1990, dolphins must be conscious in order to breathe. In other words they would never be able to go into a complete deep sleep, because then they would drown (ironic isn’t it). To contend with this problem, dolphins have developed a method to let one half of their brain sleep at a time. The average dolphin sleeps about 8 hours a day.</p>

<p>While sleeping a dolphin could simply swim slowly to the surface now and again to breath, drift just below water level, or in the shallows.</p>
</div>

<br /><img src='../eccoserv/dads/dolphinfacts/heading.gif'/>
<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod3_handle');">
"How does echolocation work?"</a>

<div id='factiod3_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>In order to "see" under water, the dolphin emits a high-pitched click or squeak.
This sound then hits an object and is bounced back. So by listening to the echo the dolphin is able to determine how far the object is from its location by the time it took to receive the echo. Hence the name “echo” location.</p>

<p>Also it depends on the material the object is made of. For example the sound may actually penetrate an object and reflect off the interns of the object, giving the dolphin a sneak peek of what is inside.</p>

<p>Should the sonar strike a fish the sound is reflected back and from the fish’s skin, small bones, organs etc. One sonar blast can tell the dolphin quite a lot of things! By moving its head (thereby aiming the clicks at other parts of the fish) the dolphin can get more information on other parts of the fish. Verry handy, and can also be used in conjunction with their vision.</p>

<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod4_handle');">
"How long do dolphins live?"</a>

<div id='factiod4_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>The average lifespan of a dolphin is a maximum of 40 to 50 years, although it is known to differ from region to region.</p>
</div>

<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod5_handle');">
"What do those darling little critters eat?"</a>

<div id='factiod5_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>Their diet consists of a variety of fish (including mullet, mackerel, herring, cod) and squid, and pretty much depends on what is in the aria and what season it is.</p>

<p>How MUCH they eat depends on the type of fish they are eating and its nutritional value and size. On average an adult dolphin will eat 4-9% of its body weight in fish, so a 250 kg (550 lbs) dolphin will eat 10-22.5 kg (22-50 lbs) fish per day.</p>
</div>

<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod6_handle');">
"Why do dolphins beach themselves?"</a>

<div id='factiod6_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>This usually happens when the animal is very sick (and exhausted (in most cases it has pneumonia) and/or parasites (worms in the nasal passages are very common).</p>

<p>Some species of whales and dolphins strand in groups. A stranding of 2 or more animals is usually called a mass stranding (I mean dang! 1 whale is allot of mass already but TWO…..). There are many theories WHY they do this:</p>

<p>Deep water animals (the species that most often are the victim of mass strandings) can not "see" a sloping sandy beach properly with its sonar. They detect the beach only when they are almost stranded already and they will panic and run aground (Source: W.H. Dudok van Heel (1962): Sound and Cetacea. Neth. J. Sea Res. 1: 407-507).</p>

<p>Whales and dolphins may be navigating by the earth's magnetic field. When the magnetic field is disturbed (this occurs at certain locations) the animals get lost and may run into a beach (Source: M. Klinowska (1985): Cetacean live stranding sites relate to geomagnetic topography. Aquatic Mammals 11(1): 27-32).</p>

<p>In some highly social species, the group leader may be sick and wash ashore. The other members try to stay close and may strand with the group leader (Source: F.D. Robson (?) The way of the whale: why they strand - unpublished manuscript).</p>

<p>When under severe stress or in panic, the animals may fall back to the behaviour of their early ancestors and run to shore to find safety (Source: F.G. Wood (1979) The cetacean stranding phenomena: a hypothesis. In: J.B. Geraci and D.J. St. Aubin: Biology of marine mammals: Insights through strandings. Marine Mammal Commission report no: MMC-77/13: pp. 129-188).</p>

"How fast can a dolphin swim?"</a>

<div id='factiod7_handle' style='display:none;'>
<img src='../eccoserv/dads/trelliusride.jpg' style='margin:6px;float:left;'/>

<p>On average a dolphin can maintain a cruising speed of around 3-3.5 m/s (6-7 knots, 11 - 12.5 km/hr) or perhaps 4.6 m/s (9.3 knots, 16.5 km/hr).</p>

<p>When they move faster they will begin to jump in and out of the water in a routine called "porpoising". This saves them a goodly amount of energy, and in this fashion they can reach speeds of 7.3 m/s (14.6 knots, 26.3 km/hr), which they maintained for about 1500 meters, leaping constantly.</p>

<p>There have been reports of dolphins traveling at much higher speeds, but these refer to dolphins being pushed along by the bow wave of a speeding boat. They were getting a free ride (their speed relative to the surrounding water was low). It is possible that dolphins can reach speeds over 15 knots during very short bursts (like in preparation for a high  jump), but they can\'t maintain that speed.</p>

<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod8_handle');">
"Where can you find dolphins?"</a>


<div id='factiod8_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>Dolphins can be found in almost every sea and ocean, from the Arctic ocean, through the tropics all the way to the Antarctic. Each species however has its own preferred  type of habitat. Some live cold water only, others in tropical oceans only.</p>

<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod9_handle');">
"Can Dolphins live in fresh water?"</a>

<div id='factiod9_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>Yes, the family of river dolphins does indeed live in fresh water.
These are the Platanistidae (Ganges and Indus river dolphins), the Iniidae (the boto or Amazon river dolphin) and the Pontoporiidae (the baiji and the franciscana). There is one species that can  be found both in fresh water (the Amazon river) and in coastal sea waters: the tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). In general, salt water species don't do well in fresh water. They can survive for some time, but they will be come exhausted (since they have less buoyancy in fresh water) and after a while their skin will start to slough (like our own skin after spending a long time in the bathtub).</p>

<a href="javascript:toggle_display('factiod10_handle');">
"Speaking of water how do they drink?"</a>

<div id='factiod10_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p>I know what you are thinking: "you cant drink saltwater" so how DO they get their water? The answer is simple… through their food. Their kidneys are also adapted to retaining as much water as possible. Wow! Living in water, but behaving like a desert animal!</p>

"Are dolphins very social?"</a>

<div id='factiod12_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p style='font-weight:bold'>Social structure</p>

<center>
<img src='../eccoserv/dads/dolphinfacts/dolphinYinandYang.jpg' />
</center>

<p>Bottlenose dolphins live in groups called  pods. A pod is a coherent long-term social unit and it's size  varies significantly with its composition. In the wild, pod  composition and structure are based largely on age, sex, and  reproductive condition. For example: subadults typically occur  in mixed-sex and single-sex groups.</p>

<p>Adult males are often observed alone,  or in pairs or occasional trios. Adult males commonly move between  female groups in their range, and may pair up with females for  brief periods. They rarely associate with subadult males.</p>

<p>In general, size of pods tend to increase  with water depth and openness of habitat. This may be correlated  with foraging strategies and protection.</p>
    
<p>Several pods may join temporarily (for  several minutes or hours) to form larger groups called herds  or aggregations. Up to several hundred animals have been observed  traveling in one herd.</p>
     

<p style='font-weight:bold'>Social behavior</p>

<p>Dolphins in a pod appear to establish  strong social bonds. Behavioral studies suggest that certain  animals prefer association with each other and recognize each  other after periods of separation. Field observations suggest  that mother-calf bonds are long-lasting.</p>
    
<p>Dolphins often show aggression by scratching  one another with their teeth, leaving superficial lacerations  that soon heal. Traces of light parallel stripes remain on the  skin of the dolphin. These marks have been seen in virtually  all species of dolphins. Dolphins also show aggression by emitting  bubble clouds from their blowholes.</p>
    
<p>During courtship, dolphins engage in  head-butting and tooth-scratching, and sometimes include twisting  and nuzzling.</p>

<center>
<img src='../eccoserv/dads/dolphinfacts/dolphinCourtship.gif'/>
</center>

<p style='font-weight:bold'>Protection and care</p>

<p>Large adult males often roam the periphery of a pod, and may afford some protection against predators. Researchers have observed scouting behavior in bottlenose dolphins. An individual may investigate novel objects or unfamiliar territories and "report" back to the pod. Bottlenose dolphins may aid ill or injured pod mates. They may stand by and vocalize, or they may physically support the animal at the surface so it can breathe.</p>

"OK where do baby dolphins come from?"</a>

<div id='factiod13_handle' style='display:none;'>
<p style='font-weight:bold'>Gestation  Period</p>

<center>
<img src='../eccoserv/dads/dolphinfacts/dolphinMomandCalf.gif'/>
</center>

<p>Gestation period is about 12 months.</p>

<p style='font-weight:bold'>Birth seasons</p>

<p>A female dolphin can potentially bear  a calf every two years, but calving intervals generally average  three years.</p>

<p style='font-weight:bold'>Calving</p>

<p>Calves are born in the water. Deliveries  can be either tail-first or head-first. The umbilical cord snaps  during or soon after delivery. Sometimes an assisting dolphin  may stay close to the new mother and calf. Although this assisting  dolphin often is referred to as an "auntie" dolphin,  it may be male or female. This "auntie" dolphin is  often the only other dolphin a mother allows near her calf.</p>
    
<p>The calf is approximately 106-132 cm. n the first few days after  birth, the dorsal fin and tail flukes are flaccid and pliable,  but gradually become more stiff. Calves are darker than adults  and show several vertical, light-colored lines on their sides,  a result of fetal folding. These lines disappear within six  months.</p>
     
<p style='font-weight:bold'>Care of the young</p>

<p>Calves nurse under water, close to the  surface. The calf suckles from nipples concealed in abdominal  mammary slits. Observations in zoological parks show that nursing  usually begins within six hours of birth. A calf nurses as often  as four times per hour for the first four to eight days.Each  nursing instance usually lasts only about five to ten seconds.  A calf nurses three to eight times per hour throughout the day  and night. Milk is composed of 33.0% fat, 6.8% protein, and  58.3% water (Oftedal, 1984), with traces of lactose. The rich  milk helps the baby rapidly develop a thick insulative layer  of blubber. A calf may nurse for up to 18 months. A mother dolphin  stays close to her calf and attentively directs its movements.  The baby swims close to its mother and is carried in the mother\'s  "slip stream," the hydrodynamic wake that develops  as the mother swims. This helps the baby to swim and enables  the mother and calf to stay up with the group.</p>
