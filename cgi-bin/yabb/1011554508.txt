Arkonviox.com cards...|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/20/02 at 12:21:47|Tidesinger|xx|0|62.7.111.252|Now then, this may seem like a really odd, idea, but after a bit of discussion with Kitnee, we both reckon this is a good idea.<br>It's a kind of spin on the battle forum, but crossed with pokemon cards (I know it may seem sad, but read on...)<br>Do you remember Charizard being THE best? Well,with Arkon cards, then Arkon himself would be the rarest and hardest to find, and also the most powerful with his grand supreme. So all of the Earth clan could be rare cards.<br>Then, outcasts, Transcients and pod members could be the most common cards to pick up.<br>You get the drift?<br>It works on a coin flip basis. Heads, attack hits, tails it misses.<br>Everybody's card has its own HP (eg. Tidesinger 30HP or Arkonviox 120HP).<br>I was wondering about opinions on this idea mainly...and how the hell I'd be able to make an online game like this....<br>But opinions are good. What d'ya reckon?<br>||

I could always do a test study using my own character and we'd see how it'd go...I have a faux-pokemon card template stored on my comp' that I could use.  ;)<br><br>Here's a question, how many HP would an Earth Clan member have, if the Exaulted Ones have 150? And what would non clan members have? ||

Re: Arkonviox.com cards...|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/21/02 at 09:52:03|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|Hey, I have an idea.<br>Well you know how pokemon cards can grow up, or evolve...or whatever they call it, well that could work here too. You can evolve from outcast to transient to pod member and so on....but not to an exalted one of course. And some people can only evolve so far, like me for example am only a pod member, so I only have three cards right now, outcast, trany, and pod member. But later you can get new cards as you post more. Then there are the rare cards of coures, which are the exalted ones, crestoes lackys and earth clan. And it's pretty hard to become pod elder too, I think only Whitin and Trellia are ones aren't they? So they might be rare too.<br>I think this is a cool idea cause I think little ideas like this are neat. I tried to make my own triple triad cards from FFVIII once....did work. &nbsp;:P||

But I sure as hell made a shit load of money selling all the doubles I had. A guy I know wants to buy the whole set off me, but I'm missing three cards. I'd be $100 richer if I only had those three. Oh well. I don't think he wants them anymore.||

I'll check and if I have I'll scan em and mail ye em. Not quite the real thing, but......<br><br>Anyways, I think my attack would be a twist of Leviatians 'Tidal Wave' or 'Tsunami'. Maybe Tidey Wave? or Singnami? Ah, hell.... sod it. But I prefer Tidey wave, personally.... <br><br>But maybe we could actually make the things? If someone could give me some basic forms...?

I think it also covers Neo sets now too, so we can have steel, and darkness.<br><br>Letsee.. Trellia would be psychic XD, I would be... gods.. Darkness.

He can be sext somtimes, but you can't help but remember all of the stupid things he's done. ^_^ What I hate most about about the dubs is they take out all the good parts. Like the episiod of the biki compition or whatever, when he gets those fake boobs. What guy! :lol:<br>Long, long ago (when I didn't know HTML) I had a little fan spot for him. Yes, I like him that much...<br>http://www.geocities.com/edea23/justkojiro.html<br>It has a link to an awesome James site, if you love him that much too. ^_^||

I still think it's a good idea, but it would take a lot of time to make them all. I'd like to volluteer, but I don't have the time to draw all of them.
