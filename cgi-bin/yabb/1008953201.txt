What about newgrounds.com? That place is funny too, just it loads really slow. Hey Yogoat, or someone, does anyone have the address to that cool movie of all the fighting stick people? Not stickdeath.com, but the little stick dude beating the shit out of all the other stick dudes.||

It's in the part called &quot;The Portal&quot;... and the name of the movie is something screwy like Xiao Xiao...<br><br>And killfrog.com's Survivor parodies are some of the funniest things I've ever come across on the web. Stupid survivor...||
