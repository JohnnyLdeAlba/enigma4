Bad News...|Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|10/04/01 at 06:54:42|Whitefin|xx|0|61.9.148.158|No, I'm not leaving the site, so don't panic over anything like that.<br><br>My grandpa is currently in hospital, because last week he fell and broke the top of his femaur on his right hip. He did that same to his left last year around the same time...<br>Now both his lungs are filled with liquids, during his time at the hospital, he's had 2 strokes and a heart attack. They think he's not going to make it... so if I seem a little distant, it's because of that... if I dissapear for a few days, it's because of that...<br><br>I'll keep up the search for more MOD's and GYM's so that I can work on my section and try to not let reality hit me as hard as it did last time a family member of mine died.... *sighs* if he dies tonight... thats 2 funerals... in 2 weeks... *goes off to sulk in the shadows* I guess it will be a blessed release if he does... the hardest part of death.. is the impact on others. :'(|||

I too know what it's like to lose a number of family members in a short time period. Over the time span of about 3 years, there were 9 deaths in my family...1 great grandma...3 grandparents...2 step grandparents...1 cousin...1 uncle...and 1 great aunt. Every time we'd get a call from family...it was almost as if you'd instantly think...&quot;oh no, who now&quot;... :'( <br><br>Over a period of a few years...I had lost all my existing grandparents...my mother's mom, and father's mom passed away exactly one month appart. Losing both grandmas so quickly...whom I was close too...was a very sad thing to come to grips with. So, I know somewhat what you're going through, and I'm sorry. But like you and everyone else said...it's better for him now...and that's the one good thought you must hold on to. That, and knowing one day you'll see them again. My thoughts are with you and your family Whitefin... :-/|||
