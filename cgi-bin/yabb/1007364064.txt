Re: Big 'Ol update!|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/03/01 at 19:50:39|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.107.39|There, I just put up one of the banners Alastor made on my site! &nbsp;:)<br><br>Arkon, I just wanted to suggest that you add Trellia, or just a dolphin of the future from ToT, onto the Enigma, since right now there's only the &quot;flying V&quot; thing. It's cool, but it's too big, so if you could have just Trellia that would be nice. That's just my opinion, tho, not really a big deal. Just a small suggestion, but...whatever, I'll quit.<br><br>Swift, that picture is the coolest! Definately the best so far. No offense to those others that have entered, as they are all very good. Mine sucks compared to everyone else's entry.||

You did an outstanding job on it...I love it! And, of course I know which part of DotF that's from...well, I think anyway...it reminds me of the &quot;Shrine of Controversy&quot; level. It's the one where you get your fins stained with Crimson, and you get the labor harness at the end, after you get help from the 3 dolphins to open the shrine...which has pictures on it much like the one in your entry! So...do I havta eat foot?! Hehehe...anyway, you did a GREEEEAT job Swift! :thumbup::thumbup:<br><br>And, Alastor...those new wallpapers...WOW! Those are frickin awesome man! I especially love the bluish one that's all swirled...it totally rocks!!! You did an awesome job on those...good job Al...:thumbup::wink:<br><br>Now Trellius...thank you so much for taking time to put together a cool dolphin movie section! I had a blast watching all of them...those air rings they make...heheh...that was cool! How long did it take you to put all that together? It's frickin awesome! And, the last one...(well next to last one)...the movie...that isn't your voice is it?! You said you threw it together...and I was just curious...heheh. Anyway, outstanding job on that section Trellius! All the buttons, and movie dividers...it looks impressive too!<br><br>Good work all you guys...I'm impressed! Everyone coming together to contribute is what makes this site the best one out there! Congrats to everyone!!! Oh, and thanks for noticing I wasn't a mod anymore Fargal, and Angelfin...I see who my real friends are now... ;) ...heheh! And, thanks for reinstating me Arkon...I'm sorry I've not been around as much as I have been in the past...but I'm working on that. And, please never forget...that no matter how often I come...it's no reflection whatsoever on how much I love this place...ya got it?...good...now...everyone smile..... ;D :biggrin: ;D||
