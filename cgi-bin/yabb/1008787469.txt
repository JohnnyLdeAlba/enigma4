Im new!!!|Cerebro|fcbg@ciudad.com.ar|12/19/01 at 11:44:28|Cerebro|xx|0|200.42.0.45|Hi, Im new here :) i just want to contact other ecco fans cause all of my friends only want to talk about quake or counter strike. I want to say that ecco the dolphin is my favourite game and i can play it all the time and its still fun, amazing and very very mysterious. (ALSO THE GAME E.V.O. IS SIMILAR TO ECCO THE DOLPH. BUT ITS NOT AS INTERESTING AS OUR LITTLE DOLPHIN)<br><br>I got ECCO 2 for genesis but its the japanesse version and i want to know more about the english one. Please contact me if u have some info 4 me.<br><br>And sorry 4 my english, im form argentina, here we talk spanish.||

I assume it is. &nbsp;||
