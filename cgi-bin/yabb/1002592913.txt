Help!|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/08/01 at 20:01:53|Guest|exclamation|0|152.163.201.47|It just so happens I do have a question, and in this case it's better to ask everyone and hope somebody knows what to do.<br>I think my Ecco the Dolphin game, for Genesis, has a bug in it. &nbsp;This is the first time I've been able to ask anyone about it, but then again I only noticed it recently when I played the game for the first time in many years. &nbsp;I'll describe what I can for now, but I only have ten minutes left online so I may not be able finish,and I'll have to come back later to add whatever I didn't get to. This is the first game, btw.<br>The thing that leads me to believe that the game has a bug is that I've ahd two different things happen upon meeting the Asterite for the first time. &nbsp;The first time I got to that point (that was several years ago but I still remember it), the Asterite told me I had to go back in time to a time before the storm hit, and that I had to find the Time Machine that the Atlanteans built. &nbsp;But I think this is supposed to happen later in the game. &nbsp;And it did that every time I played that level (which I did, despite having the password for later levels, just because it was fun). Then, upon reaching the Time Machine, it would take me to Origin Beach (I think that's what it's called). I just remembered another important detail. &nbsp;Upon meeting the Asterite, he would have two globes missing, but then they would return when I sang to him, and he would thank me for helping him. Then he would give me the power to breathe underwater. &nbsp;I never thought anything of this before, but I did find it strange that if I needed to go back to the time the storm hit, that instead I would go back to prehistoric times.<br>I've run out of time and I haven't gotten to the second part yet. &nbsp;Nobody say anything until I have a chance to finish.|||

The astrite is supose to say something like this &quot;I REMEMBER YOU! It now makes sence! You must go back intime to when we first met and *don't remember this part. I think he says you need to take his missing globe*. He then tells you to go and find the atlatians time machine.|||
no glitch...|allytha|allythagryph@hotmail.com|10/08/01 at 21:07:09|allytha|xx|0|209.245.130.39|he sends you to find his globe, right? &nbsp;To atlantis? &nbsp;That should happen.. the time machine takes you back, and you steal the globe from the asterite in the past (hence the reason he's missing it in the future, also the reason he says, &quot;I remember you! Of course.. it was I that had sent you.. now it is clear..) &nbsp;You give him back his globe, which gives him the power to empower you. &nbsp;Give you ability to breathe underwater, I mean. &nbsp;THEN you go back in time to the day of the storm.. your powers will be needed in the fight against the vortex on thier ship (thier's no air up there, after all...)|||
Re: Help!|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/09/01 at 20:04:31|Guest|xx|0|205.188.197.37|I wish you would have let me finish. &nbsp;Of course, once more I have little time due to the fact that I was having major problems connecting to AOL...And then everything was really slow. So I now have five minutes left and I still may not be able to finish. <br>Anyway, I hadn't even gotten to the part that made me think there was a bug. &nbsp;I thought it strange when the Asterite said I had to go back to the time just before the storm hit, and then instead I ended up back in prehistoric times. But that was the only thought I had until recently. Also, when I got to what I am thinking is the last of the &quot;prehistoric&quot; levels (I can't remember what it was called), and found the Asterite, it attacked me. I don't know if this is supposed to happen, but if it is, I never could figure out how to get past it...<br>Well, after several years of not playing the game, I finally picked it up again and played it. &nbsp;This time, the Asterite said something completely different.<br>And my time is up once more...if it hadn't been for AOL being seriously messed up, I probably would have ben able to finish everything I wanted to say. This time, PLEASE WAIT, you can't help me until you have all the information. I will finish as soon as I can.|||

Re: Help!|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/10/01 at 18:53:30|Guest|xx|0|152.163.204.59|I didn't have TIME to type it out ahead of time. But now I have time to finish, unless something happens. &nbsp;I will adress the replies that have already been posted when I am finished...<br>Where was I? Oh yeah, after several years of not playing the game, when I finally played it again and played that level (I thinkit was Two Tides), the Asterite said something different. &nbsp;I seem to remember him asking &quot;who are you?&quot; &nbsp;Oh, this was not a one-time occruence, because everytime I played it afterword it was the same--it never went back to what it originally was. Anyway, he said something else I don't remember and then he told me to go back in time, to a time before the dolphin-kind exsisted, and find his missing globe. And I can't remember exactly, but I think I was then sent to the level Origin Bay (I think that's what it was called) by the Asterite himself, but I might just be confused. &nbsp;Anyway, from that point on, everything was the same as it had always been, including the part at the end of that one level where the Asterite attacked Ecco. &nbsp;Like I said, I don't know if that was supposed to happen or not, but I couldn't even touch him without getting hurt, and if I tried attacking back, I would just end up running out of air if I wasn't killed first. &nbsp;But the reason I thought there was a bug is because what the Asterite said changed. Oh, I just thought of something else: I never found a globe ANYWHERE.<br>Now, what I THINK was supposed to happen is upon meeting the Asterite for the first time, he asks you to go back in time and find his missing globe. &nbsp;Then, after you come back with the globe, he says you must find the Atlantean time machine and go back to the time just before the storm hit, and he gives you the ability to breather underwater--to not have to surface for air. That's just what I figured from my experiances which I have described. &nbsp;Either way, I am certain there is a bug, because it wouldn't have changed otherwise. &nbsp;And it seems to be what has kept me from beating the game.|||
Re: Help!|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/10/01 at 19:05:45|Guest|xx|0|152.163.204.59|Well, now that I think about it, I seem to remember him saying &quot;I remember you.&quot; But now I can't remember whether it was before or after it changed...But, in any case, the thing is that he gave me the special power, and told me to go back to the time of the storm, BEFORE I had gotten the globe. &nbsp;If I'm supposed to steal the globe from him in the past, that explains why he attacks, but I can't do it without either getting killed or running out of air. Oh...wait...I just realized a major error in what I just said...if I already had the ability to breathe underwater, then I couldn't have run out of air...Oh, I know what it was, I had a hard time even getting to the Asterite in that level because I would often get killed before I even had a chance to reach him...So that means THAT part is supposed to be there. But I still think there is a bug, or at least there was, because before I even got the globe in the first place (which I have never been able to do), he said all the stuff that I am sure is what he is supposed to say -after- you get the globe. &nbsp;And then later on, what he said changed. Okay, so hopefully you understand my point here, what I'm trying to say.|||
