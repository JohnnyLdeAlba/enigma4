Order Cetacea is divided into two sub-orders; Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales).<br><br>Orcinus orca, Delphinus delphis, Tursiops truncatus, and Pseudorca crassidens are all part of family Delphinidae, orcas being the largest member of the dolphin family.<br><br>Pseudorca are simlar to pilot whales (Globicephala), which ironically, also belong to the dolphin family.<br><br>Belugas are part of family Monodontidae (white whales) and have particular physiological diferences from Delphinidae.<br><br>Depending on where off Alaska you go, you could also run into Lagenorhynchus obliquidens (Pacific White-Sided Dolphin)<br>||

I had a long and memorable holiday a few years back when I had a holiday job taking care of and cleaning up after the dolphins and seals in an aquarium on the coast. Never will I forget it, it is unexplainable how these animals can touch ones soul so......yet they ARE sad, they yearn for a life they had all but forgotten. Clinging to the memory, and then the memory OF the memory, untill there is nothing..... a hollow dead thing..... I pitty them...but that is all I can do..... Now before I get all melodamatic here, I should probably shut up. And I am not even going to start with the pod I befriended at Cape Vidal, beause it is quite a long tale and Yogoat would have my uh....head. :P||

Re: Species|Stenellya|sonifan@multimania.com|01/18/02 at 16:41:07|Stenellya|xx|0|193.253.251.77|As regards the captivity of the dolphins (as well as that of cetaceans generally), I believe that there are some positive points, but a maximum of negative points.<br>Advantage is that dolphinariums allowed the scientists to study these wild animals under certain angles, and to a wide public to approach them, what was impossible at the time of the construction of the first of these buildings.<br>But nowadays, these practices became obsolete. Indeed, we do not more have anything to learn of captive individuals, the falsified behavior. Furthermore, it is henceforth possible to study and to leave on the meeting of dolphins and wild killer whales on the wide; in high tide.<br>In captivity, dolphins and killer whales often adopt a behavior of type autiste, turning in circle in their pond anticlockwise. Animals become aggressive among them, and even to the trainers. It is not rare that neurotic female dolphins kill the babies of the other females, by &quot;jealousy&quot;, blatant example of the mental problems that cause confinement in these complex creatures.<br><br>(image: Iris, a captive female dolphin since 11 yeas of prison...She's dying since june 2002)<br>[img]http://www.dauphinlibre.be/juin1.jpg[/img]||01/18/02 at 16:53:23|Stenellya
