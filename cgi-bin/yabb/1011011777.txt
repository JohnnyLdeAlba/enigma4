This is not a coat rack. (Mdl pimpage)|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/14/02 at 05:36:16|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|Model thats part of a project I'm working on. Its not ecco, but its bound to be rather impressive when its done.<br><br>[url]http://www.dolphinparadise.net/d_demo.jpg[/url]<br><br>(Yes, I know theres an error in the texture map on the model's right side. Its something to do with the seam in the UV map. I'll probably end up remeshing that part even though I really don't want to, and wasn't motivated to do so on just a test frame)<br><br>||01/14/02 at 05:38:23|Shadow

(Mdl pimpage)|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/14/02 at 17:00:50|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|Its a little too high poly for a Q3 model (14.5k triangles)<br><br>I could probably break something down into a reasonable amount with a little work, I'd have to see what my quake mod people say though about trying to put a non-biped into whats basically a biped's skeleton model.<br><br>||01/14/02 at 17:01:31|Shadow

(Mdl pimpage)|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/15/02 at 00:36:58|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|Its not hovering thats a problem, thats pretty much just straight bounding box.<br><br>its the fact that a .md3 has to be broken into 3 parts: h_head, u_torso and l_legs.<br><br>The messy part is stacking it all, I think the way to get away with it is to make the lower set a single vert and mesh it clear with the shader.<br><br>(This might not be quite right in terminology. I don't do actual work on md3's because i don't have 3dsMax.)<br>||
