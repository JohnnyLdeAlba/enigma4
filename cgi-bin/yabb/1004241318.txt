Arkon...I must know...|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/27/01 at 21:55:18|Tethys|question|0|152.163.201.73|Why the hell do you keep changing your name?? Arkonviox, then Anark Arkonviox, now Monark Arkonviox...What's the deal? I am finding it somewhat annoying.<br><br>Also, I am wondering if you are constantly spelling things wrong on purpose (such as &quot;owr&quot;, which I think just looks stupid). &nbsp;Or are you just a really bad speller? &nbsp;Either way, it bothers me, I hate reading stuff like that. Especially when it's on purpose, it just burns my eyes. &nbsp;I'm not saying you should stop (although it would be nice), I just want to know for sure if you are doing it on purpose, as that is the way it seems. <br><br>And I'm sorry if I am sounding like a bitch. &nbsp;I try not to. &nbsp;But it happens sometimes.|||
