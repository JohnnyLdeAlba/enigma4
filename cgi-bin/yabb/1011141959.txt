I'm back...if anyone cares...|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/15/02 at 17:45:58|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.104.153|I just decided to take a break from the forum for a while. &nbsp;Tho I doubt anyone even noticed I was gone or even cared. &nbsp;But...I just thought I'd say something anyway...just in case...<br><br>I seriously thought about never coming, without a word or even deleting my account so that nobody would know. &nbsp;But I decided I couldn't do that, I don't really want to leave. &nbsp;Altho I am sure most of you wish I would.<br><br>This will be all my only post for today. &nbsp;I think now I will go check out all the things that have been added to the site since I last visited it.||

Re: I'm back...if anyone cares...|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/17/02 at 09:25:58|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.112.18|Well, Teth, I've been here for about a week, so we probably don't know each other. *shakes fins*<br><br>I can't really comment on your attitude, since I don't really know you, but I hope other people will post here and tell us what is supposedly wrong - if you have a problem with someone you should tell them what you don't like about them, not just ignore and hate them, &gt;:(<br><br>So, for all of those who have known Tethys longer than I have...can you please tell us what you don't like about her?? I would hate to lose a member... u.u||

I don't think me and you have really met yet, but I noticed you were gone. And hey! Me and you have the same story! It seems that I have offended some people in here, and I don't even know what I did. People can just be so quick to judge! Oh well...me and you better stick together then. &nbsp;;)<br>Welcome home!||
Re: I'm back...if anyone cares...|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/17/02 at 21:55:46|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.102.34|Thanks, Doom. &nbsp;I, myself, have never had any problem with you and I don't how you may have offended anyone here.<br><br>Yogoat, are you serious? &nbsp;Sometimes it's hard to tell with some people. &nbsp;But you were the one that told me people had been complaining about my attitude and, although you didn't say it outright, were basically threatening to ban me if I didn't shape up. &nbsp;But, I don't know how I am supposed to do that when I don't know what my flaw is. &nbsp;<br><br>I am trying to guess what part of my behavior it is that people might complain about, and I am trying to change as of now. &nbsp;But I am finding it difficult since I don't really know for sure, and I might be missing something that I am not even myself aware of. &nbsp;So I need people to tell me.<br><br>I've always thought of myself as a nice person, and it really offends me when someone implies that I'm not. &nbsp;Like if someone calls me a bitch, which Crestoe has done several times. &nbsp;Actually, it hurts me more than it offends me. &nbsp;I really don't see how anyone could think of me as a bitch when I try to be nice most of the time. &nbsp;But I do like to tease people as long as I know they can handle it, although sometimes my judgement can be poor in that area. &nbsp;And then sometimes I tease people just because they're easy to tease, they get really mad when I do it, and I don't like them very much.<br><br>Now, sometimes if I'm mad or offended or upset in some way, I have a bad way of reacting. &nbsp;I try to be calm about things most of the time, but sometimes I just can't. &nbsp;Sometimes I just explode. It tends to happen when your life is full of constant stress. &nbsp;And I usually try to hold myself back from any comments that might cause conflict, but sometimes there's something that I just have to say anyway and I can't make myself not say it.<br><br>I've also been told that I can be very critical, but I think I've been pretty good about not criticizing too much here. &nbsp;Usually when I do criticize things, I'm attempting to help. &nbsp;I realize that this is a poor way to do so, and that is why I have been trying to hold back. &nbsp;But it's really hard sometimes.<br><br>These are the things I can think of that some people may not like. &nbsp;But I didn't think I was doing any of that enough to be a problem. &nbsp;I think that sometimes I do things without even realising it. &nbsp;I also tend to assume that if no one says anything about something I've said or done, and I can't see any physical reaction, that it must be okay. &nbsp;That's why people have got to tellme these things.<br><br>I wish more people would at the very least read this...||

First off, you absolutely should [i]not[/i] leave...you're a member of this site...and everyone here counts. Don't leave just because you [i]think[/i] people here don't like you. Besides, if it's true...so be it...that's their choice to not get to know you. Throughout your time here, from what I have seen...it appears that you're just a very out-spoken person...who says things the way they seem to you...you don't hide in letting your opinion be heard...and your a very blunt, straight-forward person. That in itself can be both good and bad. Wheras you're not a wishy-washy person...your harshness can be taken in as being cold, rude, inconsiderate...something to that nature. I remember some instances where I've thought something you've said on the forum was kinda..."yikes - she actually said that"...(sorry I can't recall what exactly it was)...but that's just your personality. To speak your mind...say things as you see them. Once people learn to accept and deal with that aspect of you...I'm sure the people who are weary of you, won't be anymore. Then again, there's bound to be some who flat out don't like you...and never will. That's not something you can control. Besides, if someone doesn't like you for who you are...then they're not worth liking in return. Don't waste your time trying to change necessarily either. If they don't like you...find someone who does. Bottom line, take what I said as a grain of salt...(don't be offended)...do with it what you must, but more importantly, be yourself... ;) ...oh yeah, and [i]don't leave[/i]!||

Re: I'm back...if anyone cares...|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/18/02 at 07:18:21|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.112.18|Yes, DG is right!<br><br>Oh, and thanks for the welcome - as for the posts, I guess I've just gotten really into the forum and the people here. &nbsp;*hugglies all* ^.^ ;D||
Re: I'm back...if anyone cares...|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/18/02 at 19:40:17|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.104.46|Thanks, DG.<br><br>Well, I've realised, with some help, that I have blown things way out of proportion and have been overreacting quite a bit.  Sometimes I get depressed quite easily, and there's been a lot going on lately.  <br><br>Um...I guess there isn't really anything else for me to say at this point.  But the bottom line is that I'm fine now, and nobody has to worry about anything.  But, it would still be nice if people would let me know if I've offended them or upset them in some way so that I can try to be more careful.<br><br>But, you're right DG, there's no reason I should try to change who I am.  Altho, it's kinda funny.  In the real world, I'm nothing like I am when I talk to people online.  I'm normally very shy and quiet and keep to myself.  But it's so much easier for me to speak my mind in a forum or a chatroom, and that's probably why I do it, to make up for everything I don't say the rest of the time.<br><br>In any case, I'm feeling much better now.  And I don't think I'll be leaving anytime soon.||

The important thing is to realize it at least, and not try to deny it. That's when ya run into problems. Anyway, I'm glad to hear your feeling better...and that you won't be leaving any time soon! Seeya around... ;D||
