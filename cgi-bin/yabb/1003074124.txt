People came to take photos of it, sort of like a tourist attraction. Well, the odd thing was that the hole every so often would make a &quot;noise&quot;. When I say noise, I mean a weird screaming sound, every time it did, the cave would go black and people would dissapear. <br><br>The people who didn't dissapear would walk around and not even notice that others in the cave had gone missing, and didn't even seem to notice the sound itself, or even the blackness that occured at the same time. All I can remember was myself running around in the cave screaming for everyone to run and get out, but all the people would just keep walking around and taking photos of the hole. Then I woke up....weird dream, no? &nbsp; :-O|||

There was this woman we helped somehow (I can't remember how) so in return for the favour she gave us a <br>PINE CONE ON A SPIKEY STICK WITH A BOW ON IT!<br>Anyway, with this stick, according to the lady, we had permission to drive her car at night.<br><br>So when it was night time, we went over to her car and I crouched down (for some reason no-one could see you when you were crouched down) and my friend went inside the car to look for the keys. All of a sudden a guard came along and asked,<br>&quot;What are you doing in the car?&quot;<br>I stood up and the guard was shocked because I &quot;just appeared out of no-where&quot; and showed him the stick that granted permission to drive the car. The guard got out a mobile phone and phoned up the woman who started to say that it was all right if we drove the car.<br><br>All of a sudden I found myself inside the living room to a house with white walls, a peach carpet and a white fireplace just in front of me. A woman was standing there. She pulled out a gun from the fireplace and shouted &quot;Don't move!&quot;.<br>She grabbed all of the mugs that were on top of the fire place and put them in one hand. <br><br>SHE WAS STEALING THE MUGS!!!<br><br>I instantly pulled out a gun from my pocket and shouted &quot;Let go of those mugs!&quot; but she just said &quot;Never!&quot; So somehow I shot a bullet that travelled through her hand (without hurting it) then hit the mugs!
