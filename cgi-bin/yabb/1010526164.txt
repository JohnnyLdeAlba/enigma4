About Ecco Tides of Time|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/08/02 at 14:42:37|Tidesinger|xx|0|62.7.59.208|Okay, I only just remembered this (it has been about 5 or 6 years after all).<br>Ecco Tides of Time<br>I completed it, defeated the Vortex Queen (she looked like an amoeba or something). In the epilogue, it says that the queen escaped into the time machine of Atlantis, and that Ecco chased her in. By chasing her, he ended up somewhere in time....<br>Okay, I want to know this. What the hell happened?! Was there a sequel, or an alternative ending that I've never heard of? I'd really like to know, as this was something that I've spent ages pondering.<br>I remember first hearing about Ecco Defender of the future, and I thought YAY!, I finally get to understand what happened. Alas it was not to be. So can anyone in this site help me?????||

When it was made the old story was just trashed.<br><br>But if you want to know basicaly the queen escaped to atlantis used the time machine and escaped into the past. when she arrived in prehistoric times she encounted creatures she cannot rule...having no choice but to live withen the life cycles of the earth while the vortex evolve with life on earth.<br><br>meanwhile ecco finds the time machine in atlantis instead of destroying it like the asterite told him to he used it to open a door in time and vanish forever.<br><br>i guess it has something with him finding he was the tides of time. if fucking ed annuziata would have answered me email asking about what all that ment maybe wed have some answers. but the ass doesnt have anything better to do but visit lame assed Ecco sites and pretending theee Ecco website doesnt exist! <br><br>||

I was talking about his egotistical problem with believing his story is better and changing the damn thing.  While we're talking about this, I liekd the first uplift book, but then everything got too fucking wierd in the other few i read.  Not to mention the defender of the future story was lamentably bad.  Capturing traits and placing them in globes hahaha i've read post issue #50 archie sonic comics with better ideas than that.  The only story part of defender of the future i liekd was the dialogue, and that was probably wirtten by a team of other people....||

Re: About Ecco Tides of Time|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/13/02 at 15:13:40|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.31.67|Well, actually, if you think logic, you can make the two storys connect in a twisted way - but there is a big hole in the middle - Ecco 3, the game never made. It was obvious that Ed had wanted to go on with the entire Ecco series by adding another installment - but it never happened. They when DOtF came, people where dazed because the two storylines didn't fit.<br><br>Logic my friends, like Stanyella saidm the vortex could of evolved into the Foe. Ecco could have found a way out of the tides of time - remember that he is immortal, due to the powers the asterite gave him, and because he was in the time stream, his body would have grown immune to plauge and other known natual things that can harm or kill a dolphin. Then Dolphins and Humans alike joined together to help eachother when the Foe attacked.<br><br>Ne - I talk too much *sinks into the shadows to write more of her story*||

But like lotsa people here I figured out a way to fix that in my soon to be displayed Ecco fanfic...<br><br>When Ecco went into the Tides of Time, he happened to come OUT of them in a new time, when the Guardian was in place of the Asterite.
