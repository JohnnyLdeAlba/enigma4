So I don't want to send it in. Of course, I'm not sure if Arkon already has that ad in the scans section or not, but I don't remember seeing it there. &nbsp;||

I've been dying to "see" something that proved it was gonna be out for tha PS2...so, thanks, a bunch! You guys are sooo frickin lucky tho...gettin it so soon. I wish I knew the date of the US release... :-/ ...but anyway...<br><br>A comment about Tethys' query about the box it's in...well...the PS2 games (as well as the Xbox and GameCube) come in a rendition of a CD case...instead of it being more like the old CD cases that are much like your common music CD ones, they're in the ones you see DVDs (movies) in. They're just a bit taller, and open up different is all...but they're practically still as thin as the others. That's just what they're changin to...[i]*shrugs*[/i]...ya know how companies are always striving for change...anyway, that's the scoop on that.<br><br>Once again, thanks for the scans Whitefin... ;) ||

Oh, and a side note, whenever I click that link it seems to come up with an error page. I don't know what - may be the serverm but if I can ever get it to work - good job on finding the cover scan ^_^; *kicks link* 0o;; Ahem. ||

This longer box comes in handy because A. it doesn't snap as it's made out of flexible plastic, so the case can't come apart if you step on it, which I tend to do often.  It takes a little putting back together, but that's nothing too special. B. it has a memory card holder at the top, and C. there's a cool button you can push inside the DVD hole so the disc comes out...I think that's genious, but the X-Box really screwed that up.  Instead of a triangle in the center that you push in, you have to push in three other triangles pointed inward, resulting in your finger getting pinched...damn microsoft, can't even make a DVD case right.  They also don't have memory card holders, but that'a good thing, since the X-Box has thicker memory cards, meaning you'd need a thick case and...agh, it'd just be hell.  You can store them in your controller too, because the X-Box controller is just a big rip off of the playstation 2 and dreamcast controller, which I actually think is kind of cool.  It just has that little X in the center, and doesn't have the cool LCD screen like the dreamcast memory cards...but those were really only good for mini-games, and the battery sucked anyways...and you'd think that they wouldn't hire me at Gamestop because I'm fourteen. ._.<br><br>And about Ecco, that's pretty cool...not much though, just a new picture at the top and differently colored glyphs...which I don't see why they did at all.  As I saw on psy's site, the glyphs really look different...all green, and sparkly...sometimes purple.  Anyways, I'm probably gonna see if Ecco the Dolphin is gonna be coming out for the X-Box...that'd just be sweetness-Ecco on a 64mb graphics card running at 750 MHz...that'd be better than sex!  Well, almost...<br><br>and ANOTHER thing (god no!), I've done some research and my friend found this...you might want to take a look at it.<br>[img]http://www.yogoat.com/dotfxbox.jpg[/img] <br>look familiar?  Yeah, I think you just [i]PHOTOSHOPPED[/i] yours, whitefin, because as you can see...it has the "Only on X-Box" stamp on the front...what do you have to say about that?||01/19/02 at 14:39:57|yogoat
