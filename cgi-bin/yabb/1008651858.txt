Angelfin and Trellia Present....|Trellia|Liz_2emeadow@hotmail.com|12/17/01 at 22:04:11|Trellia|xx|0|24.78.125.249|d00d! okay heres the deal. Seeing angelfin's pic of her human form got me a-thinkin' that i should have a human form too! XD! aaaaanyway, i was on AIM with angelfin and i started writing about how whitefin showed trellia theese crystals that let you turn into humans and.....oops, im giving away the story ^^;; Anyway, i just started writing, and angelfin edited it, now we have a story! Its sorta long, but i think its well done :) oh, and also, @ the bottom is a pic of Trellia's Human form ^_^<br><br>The Humans of the Time Stream<br><br><br>Trellia took a breath and waited for Whitefin to surface, thoughts swirled in her head, new confusing things she had just been told. She couldn't piece them together, yet....<br><br>Whitefin surfaced. “I’ve got them!” She inhaled deeply, enjoying the cool evening air. She swam down to where Trellia was resting. “Here they are, the Time Shard necklaces” Whitefin said, watching them twinkle in the setting sun. Trellia stared “These little things? These make you.....change?” Whitefin looked at Trellia and nodded. “These little things can change our form!! This is the missing link between us and our shape-shifting ancestors!” Trellia stared at the necklace, she watched as the tiny crystals attached to a thin gold string in Whitefin's mouth swayed back and forth in the gentle waves. Trellia began “Where did they come from?”. Whitefin smiled “The pod elders of Zeal, my pod... They were to be used by the time travelling ones, these are to help us get around within the stream of time!”. Suddenly, a new question popped into Trellia’s head “Whitefin, there are two necklaces, I know one is for you, but who will get the other one?”. Whitefins face lit up “This one’s for you silly!&quot;. She let out a delphinic laugh, the two necklaces between her bottom teeth so they wouldn't fall out. Trellia looked at Whitefin “Me? I'll get it? I'll be able to morph?”. Whitefin clutched the necklaces in her bottom jaws and said “Of course! You and I are the only time-travelers left, we are the only one who were destined to travel though the stream of time like this” Whitefin gave the necklace to Trellia. Trellia gripped it between her teeth, a million thoughts running through her complex mind. &quot;But... how do we use them Whitefin?” Trellia asked, a puzzled look on her beautiful face. “Slip it over your head and the crystal shall do the rest” Whitefin replied. Trellia looked daizly at the crystal. Whitefin delicately tossed the necklace up and slipped through it as the necklace rested right before her flippers. An immediate change took place.<br><br>The water swirled with bubbles and a bright light shown from Whitefins body. Her sleek fur now traded for soft black hair, her flippers traded for thin arms, hands and fingers, and her tail split into two long legs. Whitefin, was now in her human form. She was dressed in a long Atlantean robe of the past, and still wearing the crystal, Whitefin opened her bright violet delphine eyes, they seemed to be the brightest thing of her. Her skin a deathly pale white to match the skin of her Dolphin form, and an odd marking of blue on her left cheek signified her position in the royal family. She smiled. “Well, this is my human form” Whitefin said as she gracefully treaded water. Trellia blinked, astounded of the change her best friend had just taken. Whitefin smiled and said “Well? Why don't you try! I cant wait to see you human form!” Trellia looked down at the necklace she still had in her jaws. She did as Whitefin did, she gently tossed it, and slipped her head through it. As it rested on her flippers, Trellia felt as though a new part of her was coming from inside of her.<br><br>She let out a sharp whistle. Whitefin assured her “Its allright, I know if feels weird, but you'll be fine” Trellia nodded as her long face became a flat, human face. She felt as her smooth skin sprouted long, thin hairs. Her face tingled as two curved lines formed on her face, showing her place in her society: upper pod elder. Trellia took in one last breath as her last change took place, her long slender flippers parted into fingers, and a single gold band was placed around them. The bubbles stopped, and Trellia treaded water in her new form. Whitefin smiled “Your beautiful Trellia!”. Trellia smiled and looked at her new body. <br><br>After giving her body a quick once over Trellia asked “Whitefin,” she began “Are we stuck like this forever?”. &quot;No of course not, just take off the necklace whenever you want to change back, but I'd suggest you give me the necklace when your done because I have a special place to keep them that is protected.” Whitefin said, a smile forming upon her pale face. Trellia nodded and looked at strange new markings on herself, but she knew what they meant. Whitefin had taken her to the Atlantean shrines many times, and she knew now that she was the future time traveler, their beautiful pictures showed. On the gold bands around her fingers, there were four stripes, two together, and two apart. The 1st two represent the past and present, the last two who were close together represented the two futures, the dark future and the good future. Trellia smiled in thought of Ecco. Surprisingly, Whitefin smiled back. “Thinking of old times?” She asked. Trellia blushed and looked at a second feature. Around her arm, there was a wavy line, with 2 dots on either side. The line was the stream of time, and the two dots were the past and future. “With so many things representing the past and future, no wonder we're the one who get to use the necklaces!” Trellia laughed. Whitefin smiled and joined in with her laughter.<br><br>As soon as Trellia had finished looking over her new features, and examining her hair several times, Whitefin began “Well, shall we go?” Trellia looked up “Go? Where?”. “To Atlantis, once the future time traveler had successfully morphed into her human form, we must go to the The Time Machine Chamber and place both necklaces into a certain area. Then and only then may we see they're true power!” Whitefin said. Trellia nodded and stated “ Its a good thing in our human form we can breath underwater!”. Whitefin chuckled and they set off, down to the murky depths of the sea.....<br><br>Original copy written by: Liz “Trellia” 2e<br>Edited and Proofread by: Claire &quot;Whitefin&quot; Turner<br>Plotline and Character forms are © to us! <br>Trellia © Novotrade/Appaloosa, <br>Whitefin © Claire &quot;Whitefin&quot;Turner. <br>Writen 12/17/01.<br><br><br>Anyway, what do you guys think?  I thought the two of us could finish this sometime soon :) Are are writing skills good?
