Opinion on BTT and administrative time burdens|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/27/02 at 08:47:23|Shadow|lamp|0|192.168.0.1|I sat here last night thinking about the latest trend here of administratively policing threads that have been moved back to the top, and most lately, assigning specific threads to close. <br><br>Under close examination, I've come to the conclusion that this is going to quickly become a waste of administrative resources that could be utilized otherwise, and probably also result in user resentment due to over-moderation or the appearance thereof.  I’d imagine when someone posts a reply that moves a thread back to the top of the list, particularly one that is a query rather than a statement, they would feel a bit miffed to have the next post in the thread be a lock notice.<br><br><br>Either the threads need to "die" faster (meaning that the amount of rows in the forum template reduce such that posts get moved on to the 2nd and successive pages faster) <br><br>Alternatly; threads need to expire out at some point. <br><br><br>Back to the top threads and otherwise dead threads seem unsightly, but really the problem seems to be related to site policy and the general lack of new threads as compared to off-topic replies.<br>|NS|

One forum i used to goto, has 2556 topics, and over 36,000 posts.<br><br>Usually, though, they closed the topics when the topic rotts into a talk about something off the wall, otherwise, the topics tend to just die on thier own.<br><br>Cast go on locking rampages though, that shows an unwelcoming to the lower minded ones. maybe 3 a week or less is fine, but not more than that unless necessary for the topics.<br><br>The locking of the topics will also apply to admins as well as my beautifuly evil Lackeys.||01/30/02 at 01:03:30|Crestoe
