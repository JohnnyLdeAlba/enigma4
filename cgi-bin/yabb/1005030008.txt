I found out it was him cause of his ip was the same. and he tried to email me acting like he was her and it turned out i got bradlys email proving it was him....<br><br>but that didnt ruin my day yet...i been having wars with the furry art world and i failed miserably...it was then that i relized that i needed to give up cause i wasnt achieiving anything by destroying them....plus i couldnt not with tass stopping me ever way...<br><br>now hers what made it all worse...psysonics been accusing me of sealing his ideas. just cause i do prevues on games that his site already had previews for doesnt mean i cant do them simply cause they were his ideas...<br><br>i sked him if i could have the two paintings in my scans section and he replies saying i stole everything in my new sections from hiss ite when the only images i got from him where those two paintings....<br><br>im pretty upset with the whole ordeal but have no choice but to deal with it and move on...i dont plan on crushing him like i did blackfin since as blackfin said...<br><br>&quot;i feel sorry for anyone who would trie to make an ecco site...cause you would just suck the life out of them with your site only to make yourself better&quot;<br><br>hats why i allowed him to stay...if he got better then me i could always leech from him and become stronger...hes already found things i didnt have but hes stole many things i wanted to report on like the ecco jr. pico section or news on ecco for ps2<br><br>but i have alot up my sleeve so we dont need to relly worry|||

I'm tempted to e-mail him and ask him to remove what belongs to me off his site - The E-mail reply from Ed *which Arkonviox.com has free rights to use due to me being a heavy part of the community* and my midi collection which I've stashed away now and it's never to be seen again until I hand them over to you *on new account i'm making on Angelfire*. I don't see why he must be so damn childish!! Arkonviox.com is an Ecco site, The City of Atlantis is an Ecco Site, Trellia's Bay, Dolphinjoy.com, they're all Ecco sites, but he has to try and take on the biggest of them all! It sounds like a publicity stunt to me - 'I am Psysonic, I have the biggest and best Ecco The Dolphin fan site on the web! Blah Blah Blah!'. Oh well, leeching is always fun *laughs* And thank you for making this topic, it's made my day to be able to bitch about something :)|||

I am fine...|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|01/11/02 at 00:32:10|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.6.64|heh i can show you some old emails for the hell of it.<br><br>Here was the email blackfin gave me when he gave me the undercaves.<br><br>Hey Arkon, well congrats you are now the webmaster of the biggest ecco website and I know you are up to it so don't worry.  Even with the wars I've always considered you a good friend, somebody who I see a lot of myself in...  Don't laugh!  You as I often tell you have never seen certain sides of me....  Anyway your admin contact is Andrew Woolan (wacko@emulationzone.org), I've emailed him and told him that i'm handing over the website to you, so you should talk to him about getting things organised.(you will atleast needto email him and ask for a ftp account and password for my website) but expect things to take a while, I'm subhosted by the emulationzone that is subhosted by ztnet so getting things done can be a bit of a slow process :(  Anyway most of the files on my website are named <section>_<subsection>_<name>(<author>).extension  thats how to recongize my files but I only put on author if I didnt' make the file, also there are exceptions and files that are 'lost' in the system, one example is game.html that really should be fanstuff_games_tilegame.html but I'm sure you'll learn your way about oon enough.  You will notice in the guestbooks folder there are actually 4 guestbooks, two of them belong to my sister please leave them alone for the time being atleast, I've told her about the fact I'm leaving and given her your email so she may or may not move them... at anyrate I'm sure she will contact you if she wants to say anything.   The rest of the files on my website are resonable self explanatory, my frum can be controled via http://www.ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz/ubb/cp.html  (I've made you r arkonviox forum login an administrator, the only option that actually is of any use is 'User Info & Permissions' where you can made administrators and ban people.) it consists of several cgi scripts in the cgi-lib directory, namely; cpanel.cgi<br>cpanel2.cgi        cpanel3.cgi        Date.pl            forumdisplay.cgi<br>postings.cgi       text.txt           ubbmisc.cgi        ubb_library.pl<br>ubb_library2.pl    Ultimate.cgi       My email postacards are controlled via card.cgi, it has sections for sending emails commented out right now because I couldn't get them working on my server but you should be able to use the script on yours.  THe scripts for the guestbooks and the nes page are in news directory and each respective guestbook subdirectoy.  Now as for editing the forum this topic is too big to explain but basicaly when I wanted to edit something I went to the page that called that function and looked at the source, I then found the cgi file called and the hidden 'action' field, I then searched for the subfunction by that name in the cgi file and traced the script from there making each modification s it was needed in the string of events, I'd upload the script to my test forum in the ubbforum directory after every few changes and see what the script did and debug from there.  Anyway the lat thing to me aware of is my domain name, it expires about the end of the year and I don't intend to renew it so you'll either need a nedomian or to make the website just a subdirectory before December.<br> <br>Ok thats about all you'll need I think, good luck ^_^<br> <br>-blackfin<br> <br>p.s. Don't bother trying to reply to this email, I've disabled my email right after I sent this email.<br> <br>pps my polls are controlled via http://www.ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz/pollit/poll.cgi?load=admin  the password is Uydil0dF||01/11/02 at 00:34:16|Arkonviox
