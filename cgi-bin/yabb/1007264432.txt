question|Tethys|iasoiedad@aol.com|12/01/01 at 20:40:32|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.204.57|Even tho I've been in the Earth Clan for a couple weeks, I just now thought to ask this. As a member of the Earth Clan, what can I do that others can't? Or is this board the only thing?<br><br>And I was also wondering why I deserve to be in the Earth Clan in the first place. &nbsp;I was going to ask that originally, but decided not to. So I'm asking now.||
