I STILL need an avatar!|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/04/01 at 20:03:16|Tethys|exclamation|0|64.12.106.38|I beleive I mentioned when I first created this character that I need an avatar. &nbsp;Nobody offered to help me. &nbsp;The thing is, even tho I can draw, I don't know how to make an avatar and it woud have to be a small picture anyway. &nbsp;I thought I was supposed to be able to request one from Tass. &nbsp;Anyway, if anyone is interested, please let me know. &nbsp;You can see a picture of my character in my fan art section. However, what you can't see in the picture is that she is supposed to be shiny, resembling a polished gemstone, and I think it is hard to tell her eyes are actually a dark, sapphire blue, and actually somewhat resemble sapphires. Okay, that should be enough. I would be very greatful to anyone who is willing to do it, and I will try to find a way to pay you back.|||

Re: I STILL need an avatar!|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/05/01 at 19:36:44|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.173|Yes, Fargal.<br><br>Okay, whatever. But if you look back at my &quot;new character&quot; thread, that is where I stated that I needed an avatar and would like someone to make one for me. The only way I could do it would be to draw a picture and then make it really small, but I don't think I could make a decent-looking one. |||

Re: I STILL need an avatar!|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/06/01 at 19:15:46|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.207.81| :-O Wow, thanks! Erm...gee, you know, I didn't have anything specific in mind...I just wanted it to be a picture of my chara. It could be a head pic, but then you wouldn't be able to see the fins, and it'd just look like a purple dolphin. I dunno, I guess I figured that if I could get someone to make one for me, they could decide what to do...Now I have to decide who I want to do it, but I think I will try e-mailing Tass first.|||

Fargal, I guess you win. &nbsp;If you need a picture of Tethys, just look at the fan art section. &nbsp;You can animate it if you want, but I don't really know what you could do. &nbsp;I really don't have any preferences. &nbsp;Just do what you want, I guess. &nbsp;Oh, and make sure to take a look at the first message in this thread, as it has additional information on her appearance that you should know. &nbsp;I thank you in advance. &nbsp;:)||
