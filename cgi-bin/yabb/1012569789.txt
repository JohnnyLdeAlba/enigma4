I need a good place to host for free until I get my own space for my new site. Which brings me to my question: Does anyone know where I can buy some good (not to expensive) web space? Or maybe someone has a friend of a friend who sells that kinda stuff? I want to have my own spacein the future for my new art site.||

It was so much better than Trelshit. There's two reasons I don't like html, besides the fact that I don't know enough to make a decent site with it. &nbsp;One is because it takes a long time to type all that shit and another is because you can't see what anything looks like right away and you have to keep preveiwing it to make sure it looks alright.||
