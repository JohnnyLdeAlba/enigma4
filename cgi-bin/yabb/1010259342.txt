Name-Tidesinger<br>Species(of dolphin)- bottlenose<br>Weapon-choose from charge/sonar/tail whip<br>Ok, it goes like this. I basically flip coins, to see who wins the fight between everyone.

She spins, using her deadly sonar and delivers a cruel blow to Tidesingers back. He half swims away, across the arena, being relentlessly persued by Iruka. Tidesinger twirls, charges, hitting the Spinner dolphin in her waist. She rolls, disorientated, but rights herself to dodge Tidesingers next attack. She sonar blasts him again, making him cry in pain... He's nearly finished....<br>Ikura charges for the final shot..... and misses!<br>Tidesinger takes the opportunity to haul tail out of her way, turning around to charge.... But he's weak, and Ikura dodges.<br>Tidesinger goes to correct, but can't bring himself to attack his friend.<br>However, during his hesitation, Ikura hits him with another blast of sonar.<br>Tidesinger rolls, and floats to the surface.....<br><br>Behold the winner!

Opposite him, Arkonviox, the pod leader, swims in, confident.<br>Tidesinger knows the Atlantean dolphins powers, and he isn't stupid enough to let himself get hit.<br>Tidesinger strikes first, much to Arkons surprise. He hits, and the older dolphin cries in rage. He is stronger then Tidesinger, taking four hits to defeat instead of three. Tidesinger strikes again, charging, and misses. Arkon stays cool, letting the younger dolphin over exert himself. He is hit again by Tidesinger.<br>Arkon decides it's time, and charges up his special attack, the grand supreme.<br>Tidesinger freezes, knowing the power in this move, realising that Arkon's broken the rules.<br>A green beam begins to form, enveloping the water. <br>Tidesinger jumps high into the air, and breaths air, just as the grand supreme is let lose. It misses, because it only works in the water.<br>Tidesinger attacks again, charging, hitting the elder on his back.

Anyway, here we go....<br>Tidesinger, Trellia and Swift Current enter the arena, to the cheering of the crowds of excited dolphins.<br>Tidesinger is badly scarred from his previous battles, but he is determined to not be double crossed by cheaters.<br>They all meet in the center, acknowledging each other silently.<br>Swift Current attacks Trellia, charging the future dolphin with a super charge. This does two hits of damage to Trellia, half beating her.<br>Tidesinger edges away, watching as Trellia flies into the sky. She aims her snout downwards, towards Swift Current. Her psychic blast instantly knocks out the Atlantic bottlenose.<br>Trellia turns to attack Tidesinger, but too late. Tidesinger is already flying through the sky towards her, and he hits the future dolphin on the back, before plunging down into the water, stained with Swift's blood.<br>Tidesinger watches as Swift sinks, drowning. Without hesitating, Tidesinger rushes towards the dolphin. He grips a flipper lightly in his mouth, and drags Swift towards the surface. This time, Swift doesn't sink, but floats on the surface. <br>Alas, whilst he was saving a friend, Trellia powers up another psychic blast. Lucky for Tidesinger, it misses, blasting a hole in the arena floor.<br>Trellia dives down into the arena's water, chasing Tidesinger. Tidesinger spins, whacking Trellia hard with his snout. Trellia has one more hit left.....<br>Tidesinger attacks again, but misses as Trellia swims away, catching hold of him with some unknown power. He is drawn alongside her, and is pulled towards the surface. He tries to pull away, but the force holding him is too strong. Together, they shoot out of the water, but Tidesinger manages to pull away. He falls back into the depths, and charges back to the surface. He sails through the air, towards Trellia. He hits, and both he and Trellia fall into the water.<br>Tidesinger jumps out of the arena, above the crowds, with sheer joy.<br><br>Behold the winner:- Tidesinger<br>Power recieved:- Labour Harness <br><br>||

You take four hits 2 bring down instead of three....<br>So, Tidesinger, Kitnee and Ikura enter the arena. Three dolphins, that are all not going to be beaten.<br>They swim to the center, and all begin circling.<br>Kitnee strikes first, aiming her sonar for Tidesinger. Luckily for Tidesinger, the orca misses. Ikura attacks second, aiming her sonar for the powerful orca that is Kitnee.... She hits! Tidesinger also attacks Kitnee, but he misses.....<br>Ikura dives down to the bottom of the arena, powering her metamorphosis. She hits Kitnee, and in a blinding flash of light, there are two orcas; Kitnee, with three hits, and Ikura, with four.<br>Tidesinger turns and swims away from the two orcas, knowing full well the power they have. He uses his labour harness as a tractor beam, pulling some loose rocks towards him. He examines them: they are big enough to cause two damage if it hits an orca, and would probably crush a dolphin completely.<br>He doesn't know which orca is which, and he releases the rocks towards one of them. The rocks fly through the water, impacting upon Ikura's sides, making her cry in pain. Kitnee attacks Ikura, and hits. Ikura has one more hit left....<br>Ikura attacks Tidesinger, but misses as the his agility gets him away from an otherwise nasty sonar attack.<br>Tidesinger goes for Kitnee, but his charge misses the orca. Kitnee retaliates towards Tidesinger, hitting him with a sonar blast, the shockwave blasting him clean out of the water. Kitnee attacks Ikura, missing with a sonar blast which dislodges a fair amount rock from around the outsides of the arena. Ikura strikes back, hitting the original orca. <br>Meanwhile, Tidesinger begins to start feeling the effects of gravity, and he plummets towards the sea. He falls towards a blurred shaoe in the water-Kitnee, although he doesn't know it. As soon as he realises it's an orca, he turns his fall into a super charge, and due to the effects of gravity, it will do two hits of damage and finish off the orca. He hits, hurting his snout, but the huge orca, who buckles and begins to rise towards the surface.<br>Ikura attacks Tidesinger, using her sonar blast. She misses, and Tidesinger swims closer. He attacks, hitting Ikura hard, showing no hesitation this time around. Ikura buckles, as Kitnee did, but there is a bright flash, and a Striped dolphin emerges. She floats to the surface slowly.<br><br>Behold the winner:- Tidesinger<br>Power recieved:- Power of Levitation<br><br>By the way, to Doomtrain (Ikura) you can still use the metamorphosis, even though you used it once. It's like a add on, like my labour harness. It never goes away.<br>And YAY! I won! Now I can fly (or levitate) like Trellia. ;D||

You can enter the battles if you want. Since you're a water dragon I'll give you all of the options of dolphin attacks plus a new one, thrash (two points of damage).<br>Also, I'm guessing that you are a bit like Leviathan from Final Fantasy (not sure though). I'll give you five hit points. ;)<br><br>By the way, to anybody who would like to, you can mail me suggestions for new forum ideas at [url][/url]krystal2001@hotmail.com<br>I was thinking about maybe having on land battles somehow. We have the sea and the sky, so why not the land as well?<br>Anyway, send me any ideas no matter how lame they seem. It may be used in a new forum, or this one. New attacks, new powers, new arenas, I'll consider everything. By the way, this isn't open to only dolphins. Hell, you can enter a blue whale if you like. Hope you enjoy the battles as much as I do!<br>||

By the way, I've sent u a PM about my art contest entry.<br><br>Okay, so you want a battle, fine. Since you're an Atlantean dolphin (old world or not, plus I'm taking into account your armour) you have five hits, to my three. But at least I got my labour harness....<br><br>Arkonviox enters the arena, and gazes across with disgust as Tidesinger swims into the arena. It's time to sort that annoying youngster out.....<br><br>They both circle each other, and Tidesinger's waiting for the grand supreme, although he's shocked when Arkon attacks with a tail whip. It misses. Tidesinger retaliates, hitting Arkon with a charge. Arkon attacks again, and gives Tidesinger a solid blow to the spine. Tidesinger screams, and dives. He then turns, and ploughs out of the water at high speed, and is carried by the power of levitation. Arkon rises to the surface, and watches Tidesinger. Tidesinger positions himself over Arkon, and drops, and makes himself go faster, until he's sure that he has a super charge ready. He hits Arkons exposed body, and then carries on to the depths. Arkon pursues him, and they meet in the center, where the battle started. Arkon attacks, using his tail as a whip. Tidesinger dodges, and he hits Arkon with his charge, trying to avoid the armour. Arkon roars, and he hits Tidesinger again. They both are on their last hit...<br>Tidesinger attacks, but misses. He heads to the surface again, and dives out of the water, levitating again.<br>He has a nasty shock when Arkon dives out of the water, and begins gliding through the air towards him. Tidesinger is confused, but then he realises that Arkon must already have the power of air. Arkon attacks, not easily, considering they are in the sky, and he misses. Tidesinger turns, and throws himself at Arkon. He hits, and the Atlantean dolphin falls to the ocean far below. Tidesinger dives down beside him.<br><br>Behold the winner! :- Tidesinger<br>Power recieved :- Labour armour<br><br>||

Hyperactive just doesn't cut it..... but I figured maybe we could have special event battles, at Xmas and Halloween.||

That would be great!<br>&quot;Iruka is ready...let's get ready to ruuuummmbllllle!&quot;<br><br>Hey, maybe in battle you could find those power up thingy's in DOTF. Ah, what are they called now? Vitalits? No, that's not it. Well you know, like the power of sonar, or speed or whatever they all are. I don't really know how that would work though.<br>This would make an awesome animated game though! Future plans....||

She hits. Whitefins power of endurance takes the blow, and the extra hit he had has now gone. He has three hit points.<br>Kitnee strikes, attacking Alastor. She hits with a blast of sonar. Alastor attacks Ikura. He hits her.<br>Tidesinger attacks Alastor, and hits! Al has one more hit....<br>Ikura attacks Tidesinger, and hits him. At the same time, she morphs into Tidesinger. She still has two hits. Kitnee attacks Whitefin, and hits. Tidesinger dives into the fray, attacking the orca, Kitnee. He misses.<br>He attacks again, aiming for Alastor this time. He hits, knocking Al out of the battle....<br>Whitefin attacks, aiming for Ikura. His seven deaths sonar hits, and inflicts the blind status. She now has only a 33% chance of hitting an enemy.<br>Ikura attacks Tidesinger, but she misses as she can hardly see him.<br>Tidesinger attacks, hitting Whitefin. Whitefin retaliates, hitting Tidesinger. Kitnee attacks Ikura. She hits. Ikura attacks Whitefin, hitting him and knocking him out of the fight.<br>Tidesinger and Ikura have 1 hit each, whilst Kitnee is at full strength with four....<br>Ikura attacks Kitnee, and hits. She attacks again, and hits. Ikura attacks again, powered by desperation. She aims for Kitnee again, and she's lost the blind status. She hits.<br>They all have one hit left....<br>Tidesinger attacks Ikura, hits her and thus knocks her out of the fight...<br>Kitnee and Whitefin face each other, breathing heavily. Kitnee uses her sonar, misses and Tidesinger circles around behind her. He hits her, and she floats to the surface, next to Alastor, Rebirth Whitefin and Ikura...<br><br>Behold the winner! :- Tidesinger<br>Power recieved:- Power of Vigor||

Here i go again. I'll not change anything, just write out what I can remember:<br>*note- Tidesinger has a labour harness and 1 labourarmour, which raise his HP to 5. Kitnee has 3, and Whitefin has 4....<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The three dolphins enter the arena. Tidesinger, already having a labour harness, has chosen to trade in todays prize for a chunk of labour armour... should he win that is.<br>Tidesinger attacks Whitefin, charging her, but Whitefin dodges and Tidey sails right past. Kitnee attacks Whitefin, using a blast of sonar, which hits Whitefin!<br>Whitefin retaliates, hitting Kitnee with a blast of seven deaths. No status is added...<br>Kitnee then attacks Tidey, hitting him with a blast of sonar.<br>Tidesinger attacks Kitnee, but misses!!<br>Kitnee attacks Tidey again, but the sonar misses and harmlessly sails by him. He attacks Whitefin, but misses. Whitefin attacks Tidesinger, using the seven deaths. No status is inflicted... although he was hit.<br>Whitefin attacks Tidey again, hittng him again, but once more, no status is inflicted.<br>Tidesinger hangs back, leaving the girls to scrap for a while...<br>Kitnee attacks Whitefin, hitting her. She screams, but Kitnee attacks her again.. and hits again!<br>Whitefin has had enough, and attacks Kitnee with the seven deaths.. Is there a staus? we ask ourselves.<br>YES! Kitnee was hit with silence. She can't attack on her next turn...<br>Whitefin then takes it out on Tidey, delivering a cruel blast of the seven deaths that hits the poor dolphin, knocking him out. Not only that, but the power blew him clean out of the water....<br>Kitnee attacks Whitefin, but misses, and Whitefin uses that moment to finish Kitnee off with a blow of the seven deaths...<br><br>Behold the winner!:- Rebirth Whitefin<br>Power received:- Labour Harness<br><br>*meanwhile, across the globe dolphins report sightings of a flying dolphin which many believe to be Trellia.<br>But we know the truth...<br>Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's an unconscious Tidey... :\||
