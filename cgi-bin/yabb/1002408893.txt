The asterite who impowered ecco called upon another to inherit the lost dolphin power and that was blackfin. Blackfin went in search of it and to his surprise gained all of the abilities ecco once had.<br><br>Becuase of his hard earned quest the asterite let him keep the power and all was quiet and safe.<br><br>But deep with the chasm of the murky lost nd sunken city of tantalus lived a dolphin who wore a golden mask. He was cursed by dazer the guru whale of time and forced to be an immortal to swollow up an anger that lived deep in side him.<br><br>Arkonviox had taken notice to blackfin gaining this dolphin power and wasnt plseased. Arkonviox thought to himself how this power blackfin had could be used for his own self to avenge his father xoivnokras death and end the storm of appollo. But arkonviox didnt mind it much he had his imortality a power he hated but made him almost a god.<br><br>Blackfin was pretty wise with his power and didnt harm anyone. For the longest he was a pod leader and used his power wisly to help his fellow dolphins or even a wondering whale or orca.<br><br>A little while afterwards a dolphin came out of now where and joined into blackfins pod. She had an evil aura to her that everyone else noticed but blackfin. Some days she would come by blackfin and wave her little tail at him and blackfin would always smirk and smile at her. Soon afterwards she met up with him on a day that the pod had to heard fish and pulled blackfin a way for a while to a dark cave. the others didnt mind for they knew blackfin was lonley. But that whole day blackfin didnt return to help and the next day he came back and the thers looked at him for he was no longer answering any quetions for them or helping in the chores all around. One dolphin who frequently visited the bay was un satisfied with this no one could take blackfin on because of his power so this wondering dolphin named crestoe told everyone about this immortal dolphin named arkonviox.<br><br>Many of the dolphins went in search of arkon while the others denied there leaders coruption. many didnt want to have arkons help because they knew asking for his help is like making a deal with the devil. Arkonviox was an angry immortal who didnt help anyone freely the thought.<br><br>the many other dolphins followed the dolphin crestoe to a dark sunken city. the city of Tantalus. They looked around and many became frieghtened and then the reached arkon's lair and opened the doors. Arkon awoke and looked at them. his golden mask upon his face scared everyone along with his interesting un dolphin like features.<br><br>Arkon then spoke..<br>&quot;what do you want with me crestoe and why have you brought them with you! cant you see I dont need any friends I have a curse and i must be away from everyone. Everyone hates me including my family it was only my mother who loved my and non other&quot;<br><br>crestoe responded..<br>&quot;All these dolphins are going through a rough time arkon! The dolphin who was given the asterites power has gone corupt and not very many have noticed this. But only a few have come to seek your power. if you defeat blackfin you can gain his power and seek out appollo and defeat him for what he has done to you and your family.&quot;<br><br>Arkon thought for a minute..<br>&quot;Then I gladly accept....but im only doing it cause i could use this power that blackfin has to end my mersery once and for all...&quot;<br><br>The others began to speak to arkonviox...<br>&quot;We have had no other choice you are the only one with the power to defeat blackfin many of us have tried but in trying or even trying to hint a clue of trying we have been stopped, blackfin should be easy for you to defeat since his power of control is only on us and not on you.&quot;<br><br>Arkon smerked and thought to himself how even if deafeated maybe the curse will where off, but thought how hed rather gain this power than die.<br><br>&quot;Alright then I will help you guys, it sounds rought having to deal with this mersery but i dont understand why me?&quot;<br><br>Together the few dolphins of blackfins pod and arkon as well as crestoe went to the bay of blackfin. Arkonviox looked up and smriked at his enimie.<br><br>&quot;This is blackfin? why he is so scranny compared to me, ha ha ha ha ha? is this your idea of a joke?&quot;<br><br>Blackfin moved in front of the female mistress and looked down his enimie.<br><br>&quot;So you are the dolphin my pod members spoke of? So you plan to have a war eh?&quot;<br><br>Arkonviox nooded arogantly.<br><br>&quot;ARe you crazy?!?! you cant take me on! I can banish you from this place so easily! cant you see that everyone is happy here cant you see that no one needs your intervention! Why hurt all that why?&quot;<br><br>Arkonviox replied<br>&quot;Everypod has to have its bad egg and they choose me to be it! but this can only work if the pos is mad up of one and only one bad egg everyone here seems to think of you otherwise! but a few have come to me and had there second thoughts!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I dont see why your here but for now your welcome to stay im not gonna be mean to you everyone deservs a chance! but im watching you and the moment you screw up your dead! got it!&quot;<br><br>Arkon was surprised he just challenged blackfin and blackfin didnt pay him no mind but arkon needed to wait still before making any battle plans he was confused as hell that blackfin just let him go!<br><br>So arkon stayed for a while and joined the pod. he soon got to know alot of others and relzed and sunk in. everynow in then hed piss of somebody but this was just to bid time to watch blackfin and see what kind of power he had. Blackfin didnt seem so stronf his powers where very limited!<br><br>Arkonviox most of the time stayed to the side lines alone as his brother cretoe integrate with the others and tell them stories or show them cave paintings humans did and tell stories about those.<br><br>Soon arkonviox began to make a few friends and was feeling good but then he remembered his mission and awoke!<br>One night arkon's father xoivnokra came to him in a dream. he watched as his father took the souls of many of the fellow pod members and hand them to arkon. One night the soul of even the evil mistress of blackfin was handed over to him a tresure of the gods which shoked him to a sudden stand still.<br><br>Arkonviox had this power now which was given to him to us against blackfin. Arkon even tested it one day has the others where moving stones and blackfin watched over them with the evil female. <br><br>Arkonviox looked at the soul and began to penatrate it like a vodoo doll. Then he watched the female fall to the ground in pain and all the others stopped and looked to help her.<br><br>Arkonviox was marveled at what he had gained! This was a new sensation. Later on the next day the female mistresse came back and was sharing blackfins given power the others where jelous so blackfin gave them power too but only a few.<br><br>Arkon requested that he too have power and blackfin granted him some just to keep the balance even. Arkonviox no longer needed the souls his father gave to him for he now had asterite power plus that. But it wasnt enough arkon needed the full of the asterite power to face appollo and soon had that chance.<br><br>Arkonviox got tired of the secreat of the souls he had so he started punishing everyone every chance he got confusing blackfin and throwing him off. EVery second the female that suduced blackfin would fall into pain then blackfin would look arounds suspicoiusly. Arkonviox soon let his close friend crestoe a chance at using this power and it was fun for a whil until crestoe got cought<br><br>Blackfin was very angered and banished arkonviox and crestoe from the sea never to return.<br><br>Man yof the followers came most on nuetral sides and some that where not. Arkonviox wondered how he could return to the bay he was chosen to protect? <br><br>Then arkonviox figured he could control the lives of the others there with the souls his father collected for him.<br>For a while this worked and weakened blackfin as it did.<br>But arkon had a second dream the dream of his mother who told him that having the souls is a curse and that in order to maintain a good power he must use positive energy instead of negative one in order to defeat blackfin. Arkonviox was shocked his mother who was the meaning of his life and the message. The next day arkonviox released all the souls and the others who where on his side praised him.<br><br>Arkonviox figured that if everyone wanted peace they could come to him and that blackfin may just end up destroying himself with this power of his. But Arkon was wrong.<br><br>One day it struck like lightning on the city of tantulus an explosion which destroyed the holy meeting ground and injured everyone.<br><br>Arkonviox didnt know what it was for he thought it was appollo punishing him. <br><br>Arkonviox payed no mind to it and fell into a deep rest. Then his mother came to him in a dream and he saw blackfin terrorizing her and using some sort of enegy to hurt her. at times he could trap her and shoot beams as she was trapped.<br><br>Then arkon awoke relizing what was going on blackfin was sending the bust of destructive power to the city and punishing everyone from his pod who came. <br><br>Arkonviox knew what he had to do the final momnet had struck for now he had to endure the punishment that was sent from the heavens and destroy blackfin once and for all...<br><br>To be Continued by Arkonviox<br><br>|||
