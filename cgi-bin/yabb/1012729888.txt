I took a lot of damage waiting for the crazy motherfucker to hit me, and he doesnt always hit the element you want him to hit.  Which one did you take, dg?||

The only reason I chose to pick Mutaclone was the fact that he shoots stuff out to kill you, and when yer direction is messed up, it's hard to get the hang of it...though...aww hell, I dunno...Ice and Fire was really hard though. So, that makes me the one yer disappointed in... ;) ...heh!||
