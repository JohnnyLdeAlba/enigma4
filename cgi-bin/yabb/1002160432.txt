My Official Goodbye|Possesed Histronic|john__cool@hotmail.com|10/03/01 at 19:53:52|Histronic|xx|0|216.138.171.156|I've been doing some thinking. &nbsp;Either something has happened to the community or something has happned to me. &nbsp;But I though to myslef, &quot;What the fuck are you thinking? &nbsp;You visit a damned INTERNET FORUM, dumbshit. &nbsp;Have you no life?&quot; &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;Is a fake world, where conversations are so insipid that the word pl-shie had to be censored even worth visiting? &nbsp;Think about it. &nbsp;Grudges. &nbsp;Microwavable p-ushies. &nbsp;&quot;Action&quot; posts. &nbsp;What would my real friends think? &nbsp;What would the chicks think? &nbsp;Especially, what would my enemies think? &nbsp;They don't need anything to attack. &nbsp;I mean, how would I defend myself if someone knew that i visited a place where, say, people actually regularly listen to video game music or actually like haiku? &nbsp;These people are constantly shunned where I come from. &nbsp;Fuck that shit, I'm no nerd. &nbsp;Not to mention that I get this bad feeling whenever i see someone else's artwork, and i know i should be working on my own. &nbsp;I'll be spending my usual forum time improving myslef, thanks. &nbsp;So, Arkon, not to say it hasn't been fun, but I have to choose - greatness in one world or greatness in another. &nbsp;I made my choice. &nbsp;I'll still visit the site.... its an excellent site.... but I will no longer participate in pointless forum chats that could sink my reputation if anyone knew. &nbsp;Farewell, Vantid, Arkon, Tass, mooky, Alastor, trellia, trellius.... yeah there's the high points. &nbsp;I'll probably miss you, but oh well. &nbsp;I miss a lot of things anyway.|||
