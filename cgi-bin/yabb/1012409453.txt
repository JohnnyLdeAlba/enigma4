I think we could exchange our different delphine culture ideas. For example:<br><br>Dolphinjoy's Amatso...a diety.<br>Delphi...the Lay and phrases such as "dun give a cracked shell"<br><br>i think its interesting to see how everyone interprets and makes up thier own cultures.<br><br>Mine include:<br><br>Cautla~~~a very dirty word...similar to the c runt word.<br>flicking the flukes into the face...another insult.<br>Delphinous...well...DUH...in my stroy shes a Starbeast.<br>The Navigator...a leader of sorts for the pod..not really permanent.<br>anger expressed by fizzled bubble from the blowhole and flipper tight to the body. um. thats all i can think of right now.<br><br>so...share people. i love to see how others think.||
Re: Attn. all ecco or dolphin writers &nbsp;|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/30/02 at 10:05:38|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Hey, nifty idea. <br><br>Well, other than the ones you just said about my 'dolphin culture'... a couple I can recall are things like:<br><br>-'finling' is basically a term given to young dolphins.<br>-saying someone has a 'kink in the fins' means they have an attitude problem, basically.<br>-the 'shark glare' is like the term 'glaring daggers', in other words looking at someone like you want them dead.<br>-let me use 'a wave of echo song that crowded my mind eye with a wave of furious red', as an example. Scientists have said it might be possible for dolphins to 'send pictures' at someone or another dolphin. I read a book called 'Venus Among the Fishes' that used just that technique to make the dolphins in it communicate. I loved the idea and decided to use it in CotK, so whenever I refer to a character making something appear in another's 'mind's eye', that's what I'm referring to<br>-and 'mind's eye' is... wherever it is the dolphins see their sonar come back to them...<br>-a 'blue flash' is like having a pissy fit in humans. The words blue flash reminded me of a wave, so I figured 'hey, waves are a good symbol of anger'.||

Used by the maes in the Red Coral Pod.<br>-Bugger is a term of shock, anger, or excitement ie 'Bugger! That scared me!' 'Damn little bugger!' 'Well bugger me!'. Used by the males of the Red Coral Pod.<br>-'By the goddess' is used within the Astral Pod. Basically they believe in the one goddess of Delphinius - so it comes into terms of everyday use.<br><br>Thats all I have as of yet.||

Cardinal will come to think of them as family)<br>-The Clan of the River (the clan of Oriya, who is my River dolphin and the navy and black dude in that chibi picture I did)<br>use that 'picture projecting' thing I was talking about earlier to send symbols (Chinese writing) to each other, and that's how they clarify their words<br>||

Use Australian slang a fair bit and are incredily kind, but they also have the blood of their ancestors and are very good fighters. Pod Leader: Southern Star. <br><br>Moon Watcher Pod - A Mysterious Pod located within the hidden Lunar Bay. The French language is commonly used amoung this pod by alot of the olderphins - but the youngerphins all speak normal delphinic. Great for ambush attacks, very religious. Pod Leader: Lupin.<br><br>Astral Domination Pod (Astralus Pod) - The only known Pod that can live inside the Sea of Darkness. They are also the only modern day POD to be able to sing to glyphs. Incredibly powerful fighters, and highly religious. Pod Leader: Wind Chaser.||

Helps a 'phin get into as much trouble as a human.<br>-Sonic cannon: A combination of two real devices, a &quot;sound engine&quot; which produces intense sound waves and an &quot;audio spotlight&quot; which focuses sound in a narrow beam. My characters want one of these!<br>-Fins drooping: Sadness<br>-Grabbing another's pec-fin gently in jaws: Happiness, gratitude<br>-Right-side dream: When dolphin brains were modified, they gained REM sleep and dreaming (which normal ones apparently don't have). Since 'phins sleep with only one hemisphere at a time, there are two kinds of dreams. Right-brain dreams have &quot;no sense of time but lots of sights and sounds,&quot; and left-side ones are nihilistic and frightening.<br>-Miami Humans: A sports team one character wants to found, to play &quot;multiball anarchy soccer.&quot;<br>-Freedom Ship: A real ship to be built soon, full of condos for very rich people. Modified in my story to have a very large pool...<br>-Gill-mask: Absorbs oxygen from seawater.<br>-Returner: A person who wants to return to the wild. Easy for dolphins, hard for humans.<br>-Starfin: A far-future re-engineered dolphin species, equivalent to a &quot;meta-human.&quot;<br>-Illusion Resort: Fictional Las Vegas casino involved with the new dolphin race... as a tourist attraction. Has a cool animatronic dragon.<br><br>I like the Australian terms!||

Re: Attn. all ecco or dolphin writers  |NeoEcco|neoecco1@hotmail.com|02/01/02 at 18:51:49|NeoEcco|xx|0|12.232.110.252|i think i can try to contribute few terms from my story to this interesting list... <br><br>-Star Singers; the races and clans of space-traveling dolphins (i.e. Star-Gazer clan, Star-Fall clan, Sky-Pilot clan, Tide-Racer clan). they usually travel alongside the Terris, a human colony that is based on the element of water. <br>-Bowmaster; the leader (or occasionally leaders) of a pod. the placement of bowmaster rank differs depending on species: some clans prefer the eldest dolphin lead, others will place the rank on the strongest and most worthy (this usually results in quick changing of bowmasters, as pod members will usually fight to receive rank).<br>-Signature Song; similar to the signature whistle for a dolphin, but rather for the entire pod. when one pod encounters another pod of similar or differing clan, they will call out their signature song as a formal greeting, introducing their species and clan to one another. (signature songs can be sung by either the entire pod, the bowmaster, or the pod elders depending on the clan).<br>-Tide; a unit of time (&quot;talked with him several tides ago.&quot;), usually spanning about 2 and a half hours.<br>-Length; usually used with a body part mentioned before 'length' (i.e. beak length, flipper length, body length... don't let your mind hit the gutter here, people! ::)). used as a measure of distance, but generally very short ones.<br>-Star Gliders; a name given to the ships that dolphin clans (and occasionally along with the Terris) fly. ships differ according to species. they are semi-organic space flight machines that have a design and structure similar to the clan buildings in DoF (hey, the detail and beauty of those buildings was too good to pass up! ;)).<br>-Legged Singers; a slang term used to describe the human races. more or less used as a derogatory term.<br>-Infested; used to describe a being or species that has become the host to a vicious parasite, capable of taking over the mind and motor function of the body it has infested.<br>Echo-translator; a communication device worn by dolphins and Terris on their lower jaw to talk to one another at different parts of the ship and to translate languages from dolphin to Terris and vice versa.<br><br>and some body language i can think of at the moment would include:<br>-jaws open wide with a slight to moderate shaking of the head from side to side; an expression of anger, annoyance, and frustration.<br>-jaws open slightly while gently nodding the head up and down; a sign of amusement or joy.<br><br>well... that's all the terminology i can come up with currently... i do like the idea of dolphin pods having different accents depending on their location, though! <br><br>*imagines a dolphin from the Red Coral Pod saying chirping out &quot;g'day!&quot;* &nbsp;;D<br>||

Wearing a pair of Bermuda shorts and his trademark black leather jacket, The Fonz strapped on the water skis and signaled the speedboat, which pulled him mercilessly towards impending doom. With athletic talent worthy of any stuntman, Fonzie hit the ramp and soared up and over the disappointed shark, besting his rival, &quot;The California Kid.&quot; Years later, &quot;Happy Days&quot; fans point to that episode as the moment the long-running classic turned for the worst.

Each dolphin has a recognizable sending, so that's how this clan tells each other apart (as a matter of fact, I'm going to enjoy writing from Demeter's point of view, as soon as I get to that part of the story).<br>- 'Old Fish' is an insult, obviously<br>||
