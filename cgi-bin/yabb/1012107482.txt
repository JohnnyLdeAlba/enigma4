But wouldn't it fall apart easily? And who has THAT much time on their hands?<br><br>&lt;&lt;Where has my icon gone??? &nbsp;???||
Re: Lego is neat |Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/27/02 at 00:16:29|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|Thats what the support parts on the beretta replica are for, to support the action bands so that things won't fly apart from stresses.<br><br>The MP5 model doesn't have any real action parts yet as far as I can tell beyond the magazine release and the stock latch.<br><br>Its definitly an ambitious project, I mean half the work would be getting the parts themselvels for it. Know anyone that has 160 black "macaroni" bricks? :D||01/27/02 at 00:18:22|Shadow

Re: Lego is neat |NeoEcco|neoecco1@hotmail.com|01/27/02 at 14:43:04|NeoEcco|xx|0|12.232.110.252|well... i guess this simply goes to show that lego is one of the most perfect toys ever made, as it can be used to build other toys... and now weapons... i mean, i've seen castles, animals, darth vader, even the planet earth made completely out of legos, but this has to be a first for me...<br><br>   i wonder if they'll even bother doing background checks to build those?   ;)<br><br>*imagines someone holding up a bank with a lego gun*<br><br>ah, now there's a frightening thought...  ;D<br>||
