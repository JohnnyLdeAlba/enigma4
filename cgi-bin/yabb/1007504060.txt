HOWEVER, with those entries in there I dunno if I should bother! ;) Oh well, I started a picture for it in the hopes that I'll be able to enter, and so I will if I can.<br><br>Creativity: A sample chapter of an Ecco fanfic I intend to write is up on a temporary website of mine, and here is the address if anyone would care to read it...<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/chronicle_keeper/chapter_1.html<br><br>Let me know what you think, and if you have ideas, speak up.<br><br>CHRISTMAS!: So what're you all doing this year? What are you asking for and what are ya getting for people?! I love Christmas, I get nosy, and I act like a little kid when the holidays come around. Plus, it's a good topic of discussion!<br><br>Anyway, I have a few spreadsheet report papers to do. I only have fifteen minutes left in school, too! :D I'd best be going. Talk to everyone later!<br>||

I'm thinking of going into a big city for that night...staying in a hotel...soaking up the Christmas spirt in a city bigger than the rinky-dink one I live in...I dunno yet though...things are up in the air. I'm not sure what I'm giving everyone this year...but when I was back visiting my family in October, my siblings and I went and got pictures done of us...to give our parents for Christmas. They'll enjoy it for sure, since I don't live there anymore. Hmmm...I guess I should start that shopping...bleeehch...crowds...all that nonsense...heh! Oh well, so what about you Delphi...and all you other guys? Any cool plans...? I dunno what I'm askin for for Christmas...I'm pretty lucky to have the toys n' things I already have.

[i]*glares at Histronic and Alastor*[/i] Now boys...ya best simmer down now before it gets ugly. We all know how Histronic loves to quarrel about consoles...and who cares if you think one is gay (key word - &quot;think&quot;)...if someone likes it...let them like it...that doesn't mean you have to as well. Lets face it. We've all got our own personal preferences...deal with it...cus there's bound to be people who disagree with what you like.||

Re: Yee!|FargalEX|fargalextreme@hotmail.com|12/14/01 at 13:33:39|FargalEX|xx|0|62.252.64.6|What do you mean by &quot;The gamecube's games are made for kiddies&quot; anyway?

Consol wars!!! &nbsp;;D I'm not even going to get myself started on that ok, cause I'll be here all day if I do! And Delphi can tell you that for a fact. She's herd about enough of me on that stuff to turn her into a nerd. Anyways, I find that way more interesting than what's going on in the middle east and crap. My parents think I'm wierd cause I'm worried about what's gonna happen in the consol wars and not giving a hoot about all the shit going on in the world. Hey! I would, but it just happened at a bad time ok! Beside, I told them I have to do my resurch now if I wanna be a good sofware designer. And I can tell now that people don't like purple systems and little dinky discs.<br>*jots that down on a pad of paper*<br>Yes!!! I will rule the game world!!! With this new information, nothing will stop me!<br>Ha ha. To bad I'm a dumb ass and couldn't run a computer by my self if I had a visual manuel. Heh heh. Maybe I'll just stick with my dream of becoming a video game character designer. &nbsp;::) ||
