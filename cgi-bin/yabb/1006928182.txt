Re: New section...information|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|11/29/01 at 18:53:48|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.8.152|theres a dolphin in four island zone who will tell you that blackfin and tara are below...blackfins the a hole dolphin and tara is the one who takes you to the sea of darkness||

Re: New section...information|Tethys|iasoiedad@aol.com|11/29/01 at 19:31:18|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.177|Yeah. But then I never played it all the way through. I only beat it with the cheat mode. But I also played all the levels that were in the level select. I don't remember seeing one called &quot;Four Island Zone.&quot; Maybe it just wasn't in the level select for some reason. &nbsp;And then, it has been ages since I played the game anyhow...maybe I simply don't remember. I dunno.||

I looked at it first thing today when I came to the site, and was blown away by the whole thing! You've done a lot of work on it...and it shows...it looks great! :thumbup:;D I especially love the color design of each individual page...simply outstanding! I can't wait to see it when it's done! Oh, and I hope you can find some kind of picture to put with all the DotF information...that would be cool...even if it was a picture of, say the Ray for the &quot;Song of the Ray&quot;, or a Fish for the fish song...etc. That would be something. And for the gifts...hmm...well heck, maybe you already have in mind what yer gonna do for pictures for those. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I thought it was an [i]awesome[/i] section...good work Arkon!!! :wink:||

Re: New section...information|Tethys|iasoiedad@aol.com|12/01/01 at 19:17:35|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.204.57|All that stuff you just mentioned is in DotF, right? Cuz that would explain why I have no clue what any of it is...<br><br>Are you going to do Ecco Jr. too? You should. &nbsp;I loved that game! Despite that it's for young children. But it was still really fun.||
Re: New section...information|Angelfin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|12/01/01 at 21:17:03|Whitefin|xx|0|144.137.81.234|BTW, The orca in Ecco Jr is Kitnee, whom is the orca in Ecco 2 that sees what happened to the asterite, and the dark dolphin is a young version of Tara. ^_^||
Re: New section...information|Tethys|iasoiedad@aol.com|12/01/01 at 21:30:14|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.204.57|Well I don't actually own the game, so if you do own it, then I won't argue. But I coulda sworn the orca was named Tara and the dolphin was named Kitnee in Ecco Jr. I drew some pictures of them and wrote their names. But that was a long time ago.||
Re: New section...information|Angelfin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|12/01/01 at 21:35:58|Whitefin|xx|0|144.137.81.234|I used to have it, but I remember the names because I drew them too with the names on them, that was in Melbourne a long time ago, about 2 years<br>||

There's even quite a bit of screenshots of Defender out there to be had. IGN's site is a good source for some of those...as well as Gamespot. There's even some here at this site too.||
