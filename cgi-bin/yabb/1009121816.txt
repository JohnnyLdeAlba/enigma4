Basicaly in thoery when your site is in dmoz it will go into every search engine around.<br><br>http://dmoz.org/Games/Video_Games/Genres/Adventure/Graphical_Adventures/Ecco_the_Dolphin_-_Defender_of_the_Future/<br><br>i trie to list many sites related to ecco here||
Re: Ecco web ring?|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/23/01 at 15:02:19|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.173|Well that doesn't mean there can't be another one. There needs to be a webring just about Ecco. &nbsp;That dmoz isn't even really what I would call a webring--it looks similar to Yahoo, when you go to the main page. &nbsp;I think a purely Ecco webring is a good idea--it'd be even better if I had an Ecco site. &nbsp;It could be called The Stream of Time webring...or something..||

Ill pick the idea to make a new site called &quot;digital sushi&quot; and it ll be a little ecco community. Its actually a proyect but all of u are invited to join 4 free.<br><br>Why the name? because the sushi is fish and digital is... well digital: computer, techno, etc. That means that Ecco is a digital fish... or also a Digital Sushi ^^.<br><br>I want more people that wants to be in the community to begin the web design, if there isnt much people the comunity &nbsp;is a waste of time.||12/23/01 at 23:13:19|Cerebro

Sadly, Bananafish came to a nasty end when the pond was filled with concrete. There have been various sightings of Bananafish over the years, but none of them have yet been confirmed. ||
