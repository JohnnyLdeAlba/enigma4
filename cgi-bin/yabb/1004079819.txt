More on gender|GTK|gtkelpie@hotmail.com|10/28/01 at 10:01:19|GTK|xx|0|193.61.213.130|My using &quot;he&quot; as a personal pronoun was a conscious decision. In the English language the only non-gender-specific pronoun is, of course, &quot;it&quot;, and using &quot;it&quot; to refer to myself is a bit wooden and funny-looking. So yeah, I'm in the habit online of referring to myself as &quot;he&quot;. <br><br>Despite this, most of the Zelda community are convinced that GTK is female. Several of the NiGHTS community also think this. One NiGHTS fan said he always thought GTK was a girl because GTK writes fanfic like a girl (girls do well on social interaction and dialogue, whereas boys don't do so well). <br><br>There was actually a poll on my own messageboard as to which sex GTK was or should be, and male did win--but only by a very small margin (two votes at most). <br><br>So make your own mind up ^_^ If you see GTK as male, then GTK is undoubtedly male. However, if you prefer to see GTK as female, then it's self-evident that GTK is indeed female. |||

Re: I return...|GTK|gtkelpie@hotmail.com|11/03/01 at 01:23:25|GTK|xx|0|193.61.213.130|Actually, vantid is right and &quot;thy&quot; is the second person. To be exact, &quot;thou&quot; is &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;thy&quot; is &quot;your&quot;. Trust me, I got the highest mark in my year for English Literature (180/180 in the second module exam, and you're not even SUPPOSED to get perfect marks in a British A-Level). The commandment &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot; is &quot;you shall not kill&quot;, God's direct address to the Israelites. Think about it--it wouldn't be quite the same when Moses was reading the Commandments out to all those people if he said &quot;He shall not kill!&quot;. They'd all go &quot;Who?&quot; and look around. <br><br>And as for that other comment: If you want the full story about the indeterminate gender thing... <br><br>I am a participating member of several fandoms. Now, in about half of the fandoms I post in, people are convinced that I am the wrong sex. The situation grew up without my knowledge over a long period of time. Apparently people were messaging their friends and saying &quot;Have you read this boy/girl's fanfiction?&quot; or &quot;Have you been to this boy/girl's website?&quot; By the time I figured out what was going on, it was a bit late to come out. I'm essentially male in one fandom and female in another, and if I come right out with &quot;actually, I'm NOT what you thought, I'm THIS...&quot; people will feel cheated. <br><br>Thus, it's simply easier if I don't state my gender at all nowadays. I'm not trying to be &quot;special&quot;--in fact, I wouldn't have started talking about it at all if people hadn't asked. It's more convenience than anything. |||
