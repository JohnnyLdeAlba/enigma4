I find stuff on Ecco 2 (4)|KuuEao|collprin@warwick.net|01/11/02 at 19:14:59|KuuEao|xx|0|216.6.134.28|Ecco 2 is underway and headed for new waters. Read the first word on this amazing development.<br><br>According to CVG, a sequel to Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future is underway by the development team at Appaloosa. Solid details have not been confirmed yet, but it is encouraging to hear that Appaloosa is getting right back to work on another Ecco title after so many years without. <br><br> <br><br>Ecco is a unique game in a field of repetitive competition. Another splash in the water will certainly be welcome after the amazing first Dreamcast effort from Appaloosa which we have covered extensively in our world-beating coverage. <br><br>According to unnamed sources, CVG reports that the next Ecco game will go online in some form. Whether the whole planet will be filling the sea with their own dolphin, battling or cooperating in some form is not clear, though the possibilities are endless. <br><br>We will keep our ear to the water and let you know all the latest information as it comes up for air. <br><br>Michael "Shmoodaddy" Smuland<br>Thinks something smells fishy, but isn't saying what<br><br>||

Sega exaggerates things to the point of lies so often that we cant even tell if lockon technology was really the sonic and knuckles cart or even sonic crackers.  I guess a lot of people seem to think that it will be a phantasy star online thing but thats less than likely.  Maybe games like fish fetch online, or downloading sounds and textures to replace the oens in the game.  Or maybe whole new levels.||

I hope it will b like pso, as I absolutely love the game (hell, I'm going on it later). Alas, there's 2 probs with online games. They're adictive, and the phone bill....||

I think i might get it if it does. Just need a PSX2 first...I'm getting there. Of course then I'd need another $80 for the game. Geez, this stuff is so expensive! :shrug: ||

Just cuz it doesnt have that lameassed pokemon battle system doesnt mean its not an rpg.||
