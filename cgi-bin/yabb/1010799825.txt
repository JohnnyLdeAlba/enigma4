The Medusa Battle Forum- Can you handle it?|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/11/02 at 18:43:43|Tidesinger|xx|0|213.1.159.239|I've got my new forum up and running (YAY) and the rules are simple.<br>Only sonar attacks may be used.<br>I flick the coin. Heads, char1 attacks, tails and char2 attacks.<br>When they attack (only sonar may be used) heads, hit and tails, miss.<br>After every 2 attacks, Medusa swings through. Who it attacks:<br>Heads, char1/tails, char2<br>If it hits, one hit point is deducted.<br>Heads, hit/tails, miss<br><br>Hopefully that has either confused you to hell or made it clearer how I work these things.<br><br>So, as of now, this battle forum is officially open!||

Re: The Medusa Battle Forum- Can you handle it?|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/12/02 at 10:43:12|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.86.23|OK, before we get started, I'm going to post the NEW AND REVISED RULES! Actually, they're the same, except for a few new things I added myslef. ;)<br><br><br><br>[i][b]The Rules for the Medusa Battle Forum[/b][/i]<br>Only sonar attacks may be used. <br>If there are three or more players, I roll a die to determine attacks.<br><br><br>[i][b]How I Perform the Fights[/b][/i]<br>I flip a coin (or roll a die). If it's heads, character 1 attacks; if it's tails, character 2 attacks. &nbsp;For a die, the character attacks depending on their number. &nbsp;For example, if I rolled a four, then character four would attack.<br><br><br>[i][b]Attack Patterns[/b][/i]<br>Only sonar may be used. If it's heads, the character's attack was successful; if it's tails, the attack missed.<br><br>[i][b]Medusa Attack Patterns[/b][/i]<br>After every 2 attacks, the Medusa swings through. To determine who it attacks, I flip a coin. If it's heads, character 1 is attacked; if it's tails, character 2 is attacked. <br>If it hits, one hit point is deducted. <br><br><br>[i][b]Attacks/Hit Point Values[/b][/i]<br>Normal Dolphins - 3 HP <br>Orcas - 4 HP<br>Arkon &amp; Crestoe - 5 HP<br>Blue whales - 6 HP<br><br>Normal attacks - 1 point of damage<br><br>If an attack does both status and damage, then it only does 1 damage, plus that status if it works. &nbsp;I'll flip a coin - if it's heads, status and 1 point of damage are done; if it's tails, then no status is done, &nbsp;but 1 point of damage is.<br><br>[i][b]Dice[/b][/i]<br>I use a die only when three or more players are involved. &nbsp;The numbers on the die represent the number of the character (DUR!! &gt;XD).||

Re: The Medusa Battle Forum- Can you handle it?|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/12/02 at 19:32:34|EccoGirl|xx|0|199.20.71.20|OK, it's Battle Time! Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that Tidesinger has 4 hit points instead of 3 because he has a Labor Harness. &nbsp;With that said...<br><br>LLLLLLLET'S GET READY TO RUMBAAAAALLLL!!<br><br>[b]BATTLE ONE - REBIRTH WHITEFIN VS. TIDESINGER[/b]<br><br>Whitefin and Tidesinger both enter the Tube of Medusa, slightly nervous...what awaits them here? &nbsp;The two dolphins then notice each other - Whitefin issues a challenge to Tidesinger!! &nbsp;The two dolphins circle each other...suddenly, Whitefin attacks with a vicious sonar blast, the Seven Deaths! &nbsp;But at the last second, Tidesinger pulls away, and issues his own sonar blast at Whitefin. &nbsp;The attack hits home, and Whitefin's health is not at 2 hit points!<br><br>Just then, a rumbling is heard. &nbsp;Both dolphins look up, horrified, and see....the MEDUSA!! &nbsp;It slowly floats by, and Tidesinger catches its eye as its first, unfortunate victim. &nbsp;The Medusa whips out a tentacle to try and hurt the dolphin...but Tidesinger darts away quickly! &nbsp;Annoyed, the Mefusa retreats...for now...and the two dolphins resume their battle.<br><br>Whitefin barely gives Tidesinger time to recover as she issues another Seven Death attack. &nbsp;This time, Tidesinger is not quick enough, and the sonar blast hits him dead on. &nbsp;The good part is his status hasn't changed. &nbsp;Now he has 3 HP left, and Whitefin still has 2. &nbsp;Annoyed, Whitefin attacks again, and once more her sonar hits Tidesinger. &nbsp;This time, Tidesinger becomes blinded!<br><br>And just then...good ol' Medusa saunters back. &nbsp;This time the large behemouth's target is Whitefin. &nbsp;It whips out a tentacle and smacks Whitefin across the tubes. &nbsp;Happy, it saunters away again.<br><br>Now Whitefin has only 1 HP left! &nbsp;Desperately, she sonars at Tidesinger, determined not to lose. &nbsp;Her attack hits!! &nbsp;Squealing, Tidesinger swims to the opposite side of the tube, facing his opponent with blurry eyes. &nbsp;Grinning, Whitefin delievers another sonar blast that could finish Tidesinger off....<br><br>And it does!! &nbsp;Tidesinger goes flying out of the tube and into the ocean below.<br><br>Behold the Winner! &nbsp;Whitefin!!<br>Prize - Power of Air||

Re: The Medusa Battle Forum- Can you handle it?|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/15/02 at 14:52:43|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.90.32|OK!! Here's the Battle between Trellia and Doomtrain (Iruka) !! &nbsp;Again, sorry about the lateness!!<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>LLLLLLLET'S GET READY TO RUMBAAAAALLLL!! <br><br>BATTLE TWO - TRELLIA VS. IRUKA <br><br>The Tides of Time open, and Trellia emerges, ready to do battle with her opponent, Iruka. &nbsp;As soon as she spots the [i]Tursiops Postremo[/i], Iruka wastes no time - she issues a sonar blast at Trellia! &nbsp;Trellia, who has just come out of the Tides, is caught off guard, and the sonar hits her dead on. &nbsp;Squealing with anger, Trellia darts away, but Iruka pursues, letting loose another sonar. &nbsp;Trellia hears the sonar behind her and is just about to dodge...but she is too slow, and is hit once more. &nbsp;Trellia needs only one more hit to finish her off...<br><br>A low, foreboding rumbling is heard just then. &nbsp;The two fighters look up and see the MEDUSA approach, its long tentacles aching for a scrap. &nbsp;The denizen of the deep decides that Iruka looks like a pretty good target. &nbsp;It thrusts one of its tentacles at the striped dolphin...but Iruka is agile, and narrowly escapes the Medusa's attack. &nbsp;The Medusa floats away, angry that it did not inflict pain upon these strange creatures who have infested its home.<br><br>When the Medusa is a good distance away, the two dolphins resume their battle. &nbsp;Iruka still has 3 HP, but Trellia needs only one more hit and she is done for. &nbsp;Determined, the Dolphin from the future issues her Telekinetic Sonar at Iruka - but the ever-agile Iruka dodges, and blasts an attack at Trellia. <br><br>This could be the end...!!<br><br>But no! &nbsp;Iruka has misjudged her distance, and the sonar goes harmlessly by the other dolphin. &nbsp;<br><br>The Medusa decides that this time, it will claim a victim - its lumbering form slowly approaches. &nbsp;It whips a tentacle at Iruka, its chosen target. &nbsp;This time, Iruka is not so lucky, and the tentacle hits her across the flank. &nbsp;Squealing, the dolphin is thrown back from recoil, and the smug Medusa slinks off.<br><br>Angry at being hit, Iruka deides to take it out on poor Trellia. &nbsp;A deadly sonar emits from her beak...<br><br>Trellia is taken by surprise - the sonar blasts her out of the tube. &nbsp;Defeated, the Dolphin of the Future retreats back to her time, just before she hits the cold ocean below.<br><br>Behold the Winner! &nbsp;Iruka!!<br>Prize - Power of Vigor (This means that if the Medusa or a dolphin hits you, it only takes away half damage, but only for one turn. If your opponent has the Power of Sonar, then you will still receive one hit of damage, because with the Power of Sonar, an enemy's sonar blast is more powerful. &nbsp;Also, if an enemy's attack can induce a status change, you will be able to withstand it, but for one turn only.)||

KITNEE<br><br>Kitnee, as bubbly as ever, swims happily into the Tubes; although in a good mood, the orca still knows the dangers of the Medusa's Lair. &nbsp;The dolphin who had been following Kitnee, the one named Alastor, bumps into the orca. &nbsp;Turning, Kitnee glares - a challenge has been issued! &nbsp;The two dolphins back up from one another, and Alastor attacks first, issuing an Alasonar at the orca. &nbsp;Although large in size, Kitnee has learned agility from her best friend, Ecco, and she darts away quickly. &nbsp;Alastor tries again, letting loose another attack. &nbsp;This time, Kitnee is hit, and her HP goes down to 3.<br><br>Hearing a noise, Alastor sends out an echolocation. &nbsp;Horrified, he swims closer to Kitnee. &nbsp;Wondering what's up, Kitnee echlocates herself, and gasps. &nbsp;As the two sit huddled against a tube wall, the MEDUSA makes its appearance. &nbsp;It looms near the nervous dolphins....its tentacle, fast as lightning, whips out toward Alastor. &nbsp;Unable to see the creature's fast move, Alastor is hit. &nbsp;Kitnee swims away from the Medusa as Alastor is thrown back. &nbsp;The Medusa, an evilly happy aura eminatiting from its body, swims away to prepare for its next attack.<br><br>Shaking his head, Alastor hears Kitnee emit her Pulsor. &nbsp;Knowing that if he can dodge the orca's attack, it will rebound off of the wall, and may hit her instead. &nbsp;He trys to dodge it...and is successful! &nbsp;The sonar rebounds off the wall and heads back toward Kitnee, who dodges just in the nick of time. &nbsp;The Pulsor smashes into the tube wall, hurting no one. &nbsp;Kitnee's HP is still at 3, but Alastor's is now down to 2 because of the Medusa attack. &nbsp;Taking advantage of this, Kitnee emits another Pulsor, hoping Alastor will not be so lucky this time. &nbsp;However, he is, and swims away from it, unharmed.<br><br>The Medusa returns, still wanting a battle. &nbsp;It chooses Alastor again, hoping that it can get another hit off of him. &nbsp;It flips a tentacle at him...but this time, Alastor is prepared, and he dodges! &nbsp;Annoyed, the Medusa retreats.<br><br>Hoping to reduce Kitnee's HP down by one, Alastor attacks again. &nbsp;Kitnee, who had been watching the Medusa float away and making faces behind its back, is hit with the blast. &nbsp;Squealing, she turns around, angry as ever. &nbsp; She Pulsors at Alastor, and her hit is successful! &nbsp;Alastor needs only to be hit once more, and he looses this fight.<br><br>However, neither Kitnee nor Al get a chance to attack, because the Medusa reappears. &nbsp;It wastes no time, and issues an attack at Kitnee this time. &nbsp;Kitnee is hit and sent against the tube wall; her HP is now down to 2. &nbsp;Happy to get revenge on the face-making orca, the Medusa floats away again.<br><br>Sensing that Alastor is at his near-end, Kitnee attacks! &nbsp;But Alastor turns quickly, and the Pulsor rebounds off the wall. &nbsp;This time, however, Kitnee misjudges where the sonar blast will hit, and instead of swimming away from it, she swims directly [i]into[/i] it! (O.o;;) &nbsp;<br><br>Now both creatures have only 1 HP left...whoever's attack hits next is the winner! &nbsp;Trying his luck, Alastor issues an Alasonar at Kitnee...this could be the end for the orca...!! &nbsp;But no!! &nbsp;Not wanting to lose, Kitnee evades his attack. &nbsp;She attacks him in turn...what will happen to our beloved dolphin pal?<br><br>He evades it!! &nbsp;The Medusa decides this is a good time to come back, and so it does. &nbsp;Its target will be Alastor again. &nbsp;A tentacle whips out toward him...but Al is annoyed that the Medusa keeps picking on him, so he has no trouble dodging the attack. &nbsp;The Medusa swims away in a fit of anger.<br><br>Wasting no time, Kitnee Pulsors yet again. &nbsp;The outcome?<br><br>Alastor was too busy evading the Medusa, and he didn't have enough time to dodge Kitnee attack. &nbsp;The Pulsor hits him right smack in the middle of the forehead, and he is tossed from the tube. &nbsp;Kitnee throws Kudos after his plummetting form.<br><br>Behold the Winner! &nbsp;Kitnee!!<br>Prize - Power of Stealth (Can be used for one turn. &nbsp;When in use, Kitnee becomes invisible. &nbsp;She can be attacked, however, and a coin will be flipped to see if the attack hits or misses.)||
