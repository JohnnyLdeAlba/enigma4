This is tiresome.|Lord Morpheus|Morpheus247@myrealbox.com|10/14/01 at 17:44:37|Lord_Morpheus|xx|0|170.215.28.191|Just to let you know Arkon. Yagoat banned me from the chatroom again. For no reason. I sent you an email. I don't get it. First he starts throwing shit at me for no reason. Then Tass starts up. Am I missing something here? Tass. Sorry for what ever it was that I did that upset you. What ever it was. As for Yogoat. I am just a clueless.|||
