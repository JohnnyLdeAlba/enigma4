I just downloaded the Ecco 2 beta verson - pretty neat, but EXTREMELY hard!! X_x I'm having trouble getting past the first level (which is, ironically, called &quot;The Fourth Level&quot;). &nbsp;Can anyone help me? o_o[/color]||

It was basically Ecco the dolphin in its developement stage. Meaning there isnt a way to play it through without the code. I think the code was done be having ecco face the screen then pause it then punch in the c button alot of times.||
