I actually had lots of fun going through most of all those links! I particularly liked a few of them, for example...the &quot;dolphin wave dream&quot; over at featherdust, and a few over at dark natasha's site (and she's a Colorado native like me...woohoo!). Her &quot;dog and cat&quot; in the romantic section was way cute! And her &quot;orca&quot; in the anthros section...heh...really cool, and quite interesting as well! Anyway, those were just a few out of all those links I remembered...and thanks again for all of 'em! Oh yea...and Lassen's site...heh...I go there all the time! That one's without a doubt, the most awesome site to see dolphin/sea life artwork... ;)||10/12/01 at 19:07:30|dolphingirl
Re: Help for all artists|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/12/01 at 19:32:39|Guest|xx|0|152.163.201.63|I have some folders with Christian Riese Lasson's art on them! I love his work! I was wondering if he had a site, because the folders only have the url for the website of the company that makes them.|||
references?|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/12/01 at 19:42:54|Guest|xx|0|152.163.201.63|What about references? I could use a few.|||

references|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/13/01 at 15:01:38|Guest|xx|0|205.188.193.33|I've already gone to that site and it is the coolest website I have ever seen!<br>Anyway, by references I mean something you would look at, or REFER to, to see exactly where everything goes and all of that stuff to make an accurate drawing (or sculpture or painting or whatever), which are usually photos. I suppose I could use Lassen's work as a reference, since it is very accurate, but photos are best. Actually, the actual object is the very best reference, but I don't think I'll find any dolphins, or manatees since I might do that, in the Great Lakes. Even if I was near an ocean, it would be really hard to see those. So I need to find photos.||10/13/01 at 15:03:22|Tiarra

Sorry I didn't understand before, but anyway, have ya tried using a search engine to find picture? I happened to use mine (yahoo!)...put in &quot;manatee&quot; for the search...and it pulled up some rather nice pictures right from the start! It's a collection of picutres in their gallery, but I thought they were pretty good. Here's the link incase you might be interested:<br><br>[url=http://search.gallery.yahoo.com/search/corbis?p=manatee]Yahoo! Picture Gallery - Manatee[/url]<br><br>Anyway, just thought I'd pass that on in the hopes it'd help you out! And, my suggestion to get some references would just be to search the net! There's thousands of pictures out there to be seen...all you have to do is take the time to search... ;D ...well, that is if you wanted pictures as your reference. Well, hope it does help!|||
