I'm surprised...|Miana|echolee5@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 11:50:20|Echo_Lee|xx|0|165.247.69.62|I was looking through an art gallery, it might've been at VCL, and one of the drawings there was of Tails (From the Sonic the Hedgehog series if you're braindead) The description said, that in Japan Tails was actually a girl. Kinda caught me off guard so if any of you have proof of this being true. Well I'd appreciate it. ^_^ <br>I just find it strange that the U.S. would change Tails's gender. 0.o||

Re: I'm surprised...|Miana|echolee5@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 12:03:52|Echo_Lee|xx|0|165.247.69.62|And Tails is my fave of the Sonic characters... I'm scared now.. 0o; Maybe Whitefin would know, since she lives pretty close to Japan.<br><br>Yeah, alot of the 16-bit games sometimes lack in talking, think of Mega Man, the original. I can't remember seeing anyone talk, all the baddies ever do is strike a pose and than boom! But when you get to the X series, they talk. Maybe the programmers just thought that talking through the game would add nothing to the storyline. Uhm... I'm not too sure about S&K, the farthest I've gotten is Act 2 of Sandopolis... do they talk in that game?||

I can't prove it, but I was a huge sonic buff (and still do love sonic, but I don't have a dreamcast) and I really, strongly don't [i]think[/i] so.||
Re: I'm surprised...|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 14:03:46|Tidesinger|xx|0|62.7.82.40|Tails is a boy, 6 years old. It says so on Sonic Jam for the Saturn.<br>Plus Tails is reffered to as a 'he' in Sonic Adventure 1 and 2. Plus he sounds like a 'he' as well, but he speaks pretty high pitched at the side of Sonic and Knuckles.||
Re: I'm surprised...|Miana|echolee5@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 14:11:37|Echo_Lee|xx|0|165.247.69.189|True, but you havta consider the changes. I mean, not everyone knows Japanese so people have to change the wording of the dialogue boxes and quite possibly the voices. Hmm, I think I should mail an administrator of a SOnic webpage and ask that person about. Might be an idea.||

I think it turned out to be a pile of B.S...even tho' in Manga and Anime imported from Japan, that happens alot. But Tails has always been male as far as I can remember, even in Japan. *if he were a girl in japan, that would sort of screw up the whole Sonic & Amy (Sally) thing that came up in Sonic CD.*||
Re: I'm surprised...|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 14:42:33|Tidesinger|xx|0|62.7.125.24|very true, Swifty. Plus I played Sonic adventure with Japanese talking, and English text underneath. Tails sounds like a boy on that too. But on Sonic Adventire 2 Sonic sounds funny in Japanese. Plus his name's pronounced Soni-kuh. &nbsp;;D||

She idolizes Sonic and tries to be like him.<br>2. Listen to the theme songs of the characters in SA1 and SA2. All of them are sung by a person of the same gender of the character. <br><br>Plus, *trys to find URL whilst typing* most Japanese fan sites, that have fanart of Tails, draw her as a HER, not a HIM.<br>See for yourself http://www.alpha-net.ne.jp/users2/chana/<br><br>I have made my point clear.||

It may have been female for awhile on the drawing board but they changed it when they released sonic 2.  Maybe if you can find really early sonic prototype propaganda it will refer to tails as she, but the all knowing aj freda (even if he is an asshole) even researched the subject.  Plus, his name is Miles in japan.  Or Terrissu or whatever, and in japan im positive its male if it ends with a u, though im probably worng cuz in school all we learn is dumbassed languages like french and spanish... puh what winners those countries are...<br><br>Secondly didnt dragonboy say you were pretty eao?||
