Hey Yah Know What Would Be Cool...?|Kitnee|sailorgalaxy@snip.net|01/10/02 at 19:44:27|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.91.84|If Appaloosa had made DOF into a network-play game. &nbsp;For example: &nbsp;a player could connect to the EccoNet and battle other users, exchange files, chat, go on mini adventures with their friends, etc. etc. etc., kinda like Phantasy Star Online, but Eccofied! &nbsp;;D<br><br>Any other ideas for EccoNet? &nbsp;Let me know your input! :P||

But yea...that would be kinda cool...I remember hashing this out on another Ecco message board...it was cool the different ideas that came from it!||
Re: Hey Yah Know What Would Be Cool...?|Kitnee|sailorgalaxy@snip.net|01/10/02 at 20:00:57|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.91.84|LOL Yes, it [i]would[/i] be nice to have those two not go at it every day. ^.^;;<br><br>Well, I hope that a lot of people will post their ideas here! &nbsp;Hey, wouldn't that be funky if we signed a petition and sent it to Appaloosa, asking them to actually [i]make[/i] EccoNet? &nbsp;:)||

The plot thickens...PEA SOUP! EGAD! ;)<br><br>No actually, that would absoultly kick ass. I would kill...umm...a goat for that.  ;D||

I have, so if anyone wants to meet up sometime?<br>But EccoNet or woteva would be seriously kool. Design your own dolphin and stuff before going online. It would be more versatile than PSO, that's for sure. Plus, I'd definitely get it.||
Re: Hey Yah Know What Would Be Cool...?|Kitnee|sailorgalaxy@snip.net|01/11/02 at 16:48:59|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.65.199|LOL! Aw, Tidey, that's not nice! ;)<br><br>But yeah, EccoNet would certainly rock. &nbsp;And who else thinks that they should have left the Asterite and not created the damn Guardian? Granted, its song sounds so...beautiful...makes chills go up my spine everytime I play &quot;Atlantis Lost&quot;...but I think the Asterite would have looked so tight in 3-Dness!! Asterite Power, yo!! *ish an Asterite Junkie, can you tell? ;)*||
Re: Hey Yah Know What Would Be Cool...?|Kitnee|sailorgalaxy@snip.net|01/11/02 at 16:51:07|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.65.199|Hey, yeah! I never thought about &quot;Design-Your-Own-Dolphin&quot;, Tide! Very nice; we may have something going, here...<br><br>As for PSO, I dun have it, but I really, really want it!! &nbsp;:'(||

Yeeesss, someone needs a straightjacket.<br>But the Asterite would'a looked kool in 3D, but it was probably way 2 hard 2 program in, hence the Guardian was born.||
Re: Hey Yah Know What Would Be Cool...?|Kitnee|sailorgalaxy@snip.net|01/11/02 at 16:58:02|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.65.199|*gets a brand-new straightjacket for...some holiday! :P* &nbsp;LOL Yeah, you're probably right, but they could have at least said something like, &quot;Oh, the Asterite died/was destroyed by the Foe/was destroyed by Man/etc. etc. etc.&quot; instead of just ignoring the old storyline all together.||
Re: Hey Yah Know What Would Be Cool...?|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/11/02 at 17:03:13|Tidesinger|xx|0|213.122.227.207|Yeah, but if they didn't ignore the old storylines, then DOF wouldnt have been made. At the end of Tides of Time, Ecco followed the Vortex Queen into the time machin in Atlantis rather than destroying it like the Asterite told him to, so it would've made the story completely different. <br>And who says you gotta be a dolphin? Why not design your own whale or porpoise? Or maybe even a fish and try to dodge all the hungry dolphins.....||

The big ol' DNA strand would of looked awesome in those beautiful graphics.<br>I don't have PSO, but I love PS4!!! The best RPG ever I say. Yes, better then Final Fantasy. *YEEP* I can't believe I just said that!<br>I'm not really a fan of online games though, but customizing your own dolphin character would be the best! ||

I flat out can't wait.<br>Hope that there's a battle forum in it as well as a co-operative mode....<br>If it is like PSO, and you can design your own dolphin, then Tidesinger will be born in true 3D.||

Re: Hey Yah Know What Would Be Cool...?|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/15/02 at 11:05:22|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.112.18|LOL That would be fun! Then we can say that the idea started aaalll here first! ;D Or maybe not...depending on how old that article that told us about Ecco 4 is. &nbsp;App. may or may not have had the idea first, and I probably didn't, either. I'm sure that at least one or two other Ecco fans thought of the exact same thing. :)||
