A time forgotten...a time remembered...|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|12/20/01 at 21:29:57|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.7.117|[i]6.29.2001 Updated by: blackfin<br><br>Well today I'm writing an update I promised I'd never have to make.... I'm retiring from the ecco fan community. I'm sorry to all my friends and visitors for letting you down but for various reasons I can no longer stay... The work from my course has been building and building and starting now I'm moving onto a phase where being here and doing my work is impossible and needless to say I have to give my course priority... but things have been pushed forwards but recient events... A few days ago I did something I shouldn't have, I asked my old girlfriend megz back out, at the time I was under the impression that she had no serious attachments but I have now found I was seriously wrong and have hurt somebody, and staying around is only going to hurt more, I want to try to heal the damage I did and the only way I can see of doing that is leaving now rather than later. So please don't blaim megz for agreeing to go back to me, I put her in a very akward postion that I never should have but her in and so it's really may fault. Please as a last request from me, be nice to her. If you are my friend at all please grant me this last favour.... And please megz and your new bf, don't let my stupidy destroy anything, be happy.... Anyway it's been a great year and 1/2 that I've had the privledge of being the webmaster of this website, you have all done so much for me, you've change me and made me better in so many ways but the fact is now I'm trapped in this website as well, I need to break free from my virtual world and go live in the real wourld untill I sort out parts of my life... I still have a lot to learn about life and love and untill then I can't be here. I'm going to miss you all my friends greatlly. I've emailed some of you to say boodbye personally, don't feel left out if I've not emailed you, I did this all off the top of my head so I probally missed a few people... Anyway I wish you all the best of luck in life and don't bother trying to contact me, I've decided a clean break is needed so I've terminated my email, icq and aim accounts and I won't be returning to any websites... don't worry though, I've handed over control of the website to Arkonviox so the ecco comunity will continue... Goodbye all and all the best wishes in life...[/i]<br><br>That was the final update of the first Ecco the Dolphin website known as &quot;The Undercaves&quot; before i took over the Ecco Community.<br><br>I keep an archive of all my updates going back to last year.<br>If you would like to view them they can be downloaded from this file.<br><br>http://www.arkonviox.com/updates.doc<br><br>||12/20/01 at 22:18:02|Arkonviox

I thought you were closing down this place and leaving. I didn't think that part about Megz sounded right. &nbsp;::)<br>*phew* Good thing. This place is shapping out great, and I wouldn't want it to get shut down. Then we'd all have to find a new place to post and harass eachother in. ||

I guess that shows you how much people actually change...<br><br>But oh well. Look at us all now, huh? &nbsp;8)||
