That was awesome, I loved it. &nbsp;I have to read the books now, but I can't yet because I'm reading somehting for English. &nbsp;I read The Hobbit--well actually I read about 3 fourths of it, I never finished it. &nbsp;But that movie was great, the effects were incredible--I loved the big giant fire creature thingy. That was way cool. &nbsp;Does anybody know the name of the actor that played the elf? &nbsp;I mean the one that went with them--the wood elf. &nbsp;The names of the characters were hard to understand, I didn;t cathc most of them.||

I remember, when I was very young,(waaay back in the early 80's) I watched the animated version of the Lord of the Rings (the only thing I remember from it now, is the part when those &quot;hooded horsemen&quot; were stabbing the sleeping beds, those travelers were supposed to sleep on).<br>____________________________________________________||

It was quite good although it was 3 hours long. Now I'm gonna have to see part 2. I did think that the Orc/Goblin crossbreed thingies looked pretty good, especially when they were all chopped to bits.<br>The special F-X were good and I noticed a lot of CGI on the big monsters, not on the smaller ones though. And the size differences between Gandalf and Frodo just looked funny.<br><br>I thought it was ok. The sound of crying kids kinda got on my nerves though. Try watching one of Peter Jacksons older films and you'll probably wonder how the hell he made this.

Re: Lord of the Rings|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/28/01 at 22:01:57|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.176|I'll go! I'll go! &nbsp; :D<br><br>Um, they weren't orc/goblin crossbreeds...they were just plain orcs. &nbsp;That's what the characters called them. &nbsp;And hobbits are supposed to be very small. &nbsp;I assume Gandalf is a human who just happens to be a wizard. &nbsp;I don't remember if it said that in The Hobbit or not. &nbsp;But that accounts for the size difference. &nbsp;Humans are the tallest, then elves are a little smaller (I personally think they made them a bit too tall in the movie, they didn't really appear any smaller than the humans), then dwaves are smaller then elves, and hobbits are the smallest. &nbsp;This I know from reading The Hobbit. &nbsp;So obviously it makes sense that Gandalf would be so much bigger than Frodo. &nbsp;Actually, I always thought all those creatures would be smaller than how they're portrayd in the movie.||
