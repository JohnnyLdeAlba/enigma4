Ecco Word Scramble|dolphingirl|dolphingirl@arkonviox.com|12/16/01 at 14:05:08|dolphingirl|xx|0|63.206.171.14|Yes...it's time once again to start this topic! We have games on the other forum...so why not start a totally Ecco related one here! Perhaps it'll get those game players who only visit the Off Topic board...to come here too!<br><br>Here's the rules, I'll start, and whoever guesses correctly first gets to do the new scrambled word. Only do one at a time (meaning don't list like 10 scrambled words). It doesn't have to be one word, but if it's more than one, either separate them somehow, or combine them telling everyone how many words are in the scramble. Hmmm...I think that's about it...so, lets begin!<br><br> <br>Q U A I N R A M B A E Y A<br><br>(2 words) <br><br>||

Oh well.  I figured it out anyway.  That's Mutaclone.  The only reason I could have possibly figured that out is because I've seen it on this site. But I have no idea what a mutaclone is.  So I'm not even sure if I got it right.<br>  I must be really stupid because it always takes me forever to figure out word scrambles, unless it's like 3 or 4 letters or something....||

I guess I'll have to use mine up there again, next time I guess a scrambled word.<br><br>Anyway, I think it's time to set forth the rules once again, and modify/add some...so here are the [color=Red]RULES[/color] as of [i]right now[/i]:<br><br>[color=Red]- It's [i]only[/i] your turn when you can correctly guess the scrambled word up for grabs. It's usually obvious with common sense if you've guessed it right...so just continue the process. If you're totally unsure...then ask...and please, no one continue the game till the question has been answered.<br><br>- If someone has stopped the process for one reason or another, and one currently isn't on the table...then it's first come first serve to start the new one.<br><br>- You must specifiy how many words your scrambled is, if it exceeds one word. If no specifications are made, it's assumed that it's only one word.<br><br>- Please don't do any scrambles that are more than 3-4 words in length...it makes it too hard in some cases. If you want to do more than that, seperate your words with spaces, and scramble each one seperately instead of combining them all.<br><br>- If a scramble has been on the table for too long, you need to give a clue. If you don't come around frequent enough, and everyone's stuck...you risk getting skipped, and your word won't get guessed![/color]<br><br>There, now that that's all outa the way...lets continue please... ;D ...with the word that Stenellya has scrambled!||
Re: Ecco Word Scramble|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/30/01 at 19:43:33|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.22|Well I don't know what that one is right now, but I just wanted to restate that I haven't played DotF very much and, being that I haven't played it in so long, I never got very far. &nbsp;In fact, I never got past the coral reef, or whatever that level is called. &nbsp;So I don't know what the levels are caled and I don't know all of the characters, and so don't treat me like I'm a damn idiot when I don't know what something is.||

I didn't think that was really it...so I went searching. You see, I've not played Tides of Time yet...so it helps to search through those level titles since I'm not at all familiar with them. In doing so...I found &quot;The Lost Orcas&quot;! So, that's my guess... ;D ...and I think I'm right! Good one there, Trellia!<br><br>I have to say something...Tethys...I mean, I haven't even played Tides of Time yet and was able to figure that one out...skillfully, using resources to look up the game's info. If you know you haven't played one of the Ecco games...especially the most recent/popular one...ya might think twice before responding with [i]&quot;That just doesn't make sense...it must be something else.&quot;[/i] Next time you guess one, and it ends up being a word/phrase you're not familiar with...it just might be from Defender of the Future. In fact that's the game I'm most familiar with, so that's usually where all my scrambles come from. In the future, maybe if you guess a word, and it doesn't ring a bell...ask where it is in the Ecco games, instead of assuming it can't be right. Please don't take offense to this...I'm just trying to be helpful is all... ;)<br><br>Okay! Finally! I've guessed a scramble...so I can go back to the one I previously posted that was overlooked!

Here's a thought, if you think it might be from DotF...try checking the level names in the &quot;Guides&quot; section of the site. That's what I do if something doesn't ring a bell right away. And as far as the level's name, &quot;Roaring Forces&quot;...not making any sense...hehe...well, that's kinda silly. It makes as much sense to me as a level title needs to...look up &quot;force&quot; and &quot;roar&quot; in the dictionary...you can get a good enough idea, in my opinoin that is.<br><br>Anyway, on with the game...Stenellya...good job! You guessed correctly! I didn't want to include the other words cause it would've given it away to quickly. So, I just went with the one. And you're right...Tranquility - as in Isle of Tranquility (the first section of the game)... ;) ...that'd make it your turn!
