No they aren't the best, and really, this post is not important, but if you really feel you must critisize the products of boredom and expierimentation, then feel free!  :)<br>anyways.

Not only does it look cool, but people will be able to tell that it's an Ecco site, and would therefore be more likely to come here then if they had no clue what the site is about. After all, not everyone knows what an &quot;Arkonviox&quot; is. The first one's cool, but it's not what I'd call a banner. &nbsp;It's more like a parody.||
Re: I was bored so I... (banner city)|Alastor|Al@Arkonviox.com|12/01/01 at 19:58:46|Alastor|xx|0|64.0.99.137|well yeah, it's a joke, and the cube is just an expieriment.||
