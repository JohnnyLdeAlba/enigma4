Re: Site Update|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/21/02 at 19:57:53|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|The quality of the fine detail with the acrylics is very impressive. Some of the highlights and shadow is very close to what vertex pushers like myself can get with transparency lighting.||
Re: Site Update|NeoEcco|neoecco1@hotmail.com|01/21/02 at 20:11:50|NeoEcco|xx|0|12.232.110.252|*commencing de-lurk mode*<br><br>   i am quite grateful for this gesture of yours, Swift Current! your talent and efforts are greatly appreciated. i absolutely love the painting, you have gotten my persona down perfectly! the background for it is exceptionally nice as well! it gives a very lonely, almost mysterious feel to it as a whole.<br><br>   in fact, i'm quite impressed and appreciative with all of the works people have done for me here! though i haven't been here for long, i am quite pleased with how kind people are here towards a such a reclusive pod mate...<br><br>   though all i can possibly offer so far for these excellent drawings are my humble thanks and hopes that i can reimburse with a work of my own soon...<br><br>   on another note, i do like the updates to the site, Swift Current! the new background there looks quite nice, interesting idea to keep it stationary like that! keep up the good work!<br><br>   anyway, i wish to express my thanks once again... to everyone here that has been so kind to me! i feel much more assured now to approach this forum knowing that i am a member here.<br>   ||
Re: Site Update|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|01/21/02 at 20:20:27|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.167.198|Yay, your first post! Congrat's Neo...and your very welcome, it was a fun project.    :D<br><br>Hey, here's an idea! Perhaps someone can make another face image of your character out of that picture, it's much better and more anatomically correct compared to that quick colored pencil group drawing I did. Just an idea, but worth throwin' out there.  ;D||

Re: Site Update|dolphingirl|dolphingirl@arkonviox.com|01/22/02 at 01:00:56|dolphingirl|xx|0|63.196.189.41|Hey NeoEcco... ;D ...it's good to see you've finally mustered up enough to make a post on the forum...congrats! Hope you see you around here more often... ;)<br><br>And for you Swift... :D ...nice job on the lil update! I think the background for the 2nd index page is way cool...I always thought that pic in particular was really cool. When I look at it, I'm always like "woah she's not one to get into a fight with"... ;) ...hehehe! Anyway, that pic you did of NeoEcco... :o ...my goodness!!! I can't believe how frickin cool it looks! I love the detailed work on the coral n'stuff...it look so...dazzling (cheesy word, but yea yea...it's what popped into mind - heh)!  I also really like the way you did the reflecting water effect off of her. I've always been in awe...wondering just how that is artists achieve that look...really outstanding Swift... :thumbup: ...great job!||

Re: Site Update|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|01/24/02 at 04:58:13|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.170.233|I updated again this morning. Added to the Fiction this time. The first part of Chapter Four is up, and I added two freehand photoshop pictures with it that turned out real nice. Anyone who's curious should take a look, and tell me what you think.  ;D||
Re: Site Update|vantid|vantid@arkonviox.com|01/24/02 at 07:04:35|vantid|xx|0|207.80.104.200|Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuude. I LOVE those pix. they so cool. i suck at those sci-fi-ish drawings. Ill print out the cgap and read it at home. weeee!||
Re: Site Update|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|01/24/02 at 19:08:33|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.168.108|I had fun drawin' those...tho' the tunnel one pissed me off and I re-did it about 4 times before I got it the way I wanted it. Not bad for freehand with a mouse eh?   ;)||
Re: Site Update|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/24/02 at 23:27:19|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.25.8|Waiii!!! MORE ART AND STORY! Eh, sory, I'm just hooked on your story Swifters *lurks away to perv at new goodiness filled chapter*||
Re: Site Update|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|01/25/02 at 04:57:03|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.170.250|I'm happy to hear that your enjoying it so far Whitefin. Believe me, I find writting to be extremely hard. I'm more of a visual storyteller (thus I'm a painter and a drawer), I find it very difficult to put images in my head on paper as the written word, but makin' a comic of swift's story would litterally take me months per chapter. It's faster and easier to put ideas down by just writing them.  ;D||
Re: Site Update|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/25/02 at 05:35:33|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.24.203|Tee-hee, I'm like you. I'm not much of a writer - more of a visual artist. Yet my writing style has improved alot since I last wrote a story, thats why I started the Whitefin Trilogy. ||

Re: Site Update|NeoEcco|neoecco1@hotmail.com|01/25/02 at 12:24:10|NeoEcco|xx|0|12.232.110.252|wow! i'm very impressed with this new chapter of yours, Swift! very nice, indeed, i can practically envision the surrounding areas from the detail. <br><br>those pictures above the chapters are also quite nice! did them both on computer with a mouse, you say? *promptly passes out* ... ow... i couldn't come anywhere close to that by simply drawing!  :D excellent work, though! the story is getting better every time.<br><br>i understand how difficult it can be to transcribe an entire story in your head correctly... it's never easy to figure out exactly what to say, i should know! i haven't even attempted my stories for some time... but i cannot wait until the next chapter is up! good luck with that!<br>||
