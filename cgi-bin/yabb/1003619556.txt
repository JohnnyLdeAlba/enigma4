DOES THE VORTEX WALK AMONG US?|asteritius|asteritius@hotmail.com|10/20/01 at 17:12:36|asteritius|xx|0|217.216.121.33|As we can see in ToT EPILOGUE the vortex queen gone to the very past of our planet and tried to continue her plans there...but it could not be . BUT the queen got into &quot;Earth´s life cycles&quot; .What´s the true meaning of that? Are all lifeforms tainted by The Foe by &quot;touching&quot; their geneseed? Are the dolphins the only ones in avoiding this? What about the mankind? Do we have the same expansion drive or instinc?|||

Well, let's see...The Europeans colonized just about every part of the planet. And now that we have the technology to go into space, we are looking towards colonizing Mars. &nbsp;And, we are looking for other plantes to colonize. &nbsp;Hmm...I found that statement confusing as well, but I never thought anything of it...Of course, you do realise the notion that Vortex are even real at all is insane...It's kinda of like when my friends and I were into Animorphs and talked about what if the Yeerks were real and actually invading...<br><br>But, then again, my motto is anything is possible. :alien:|||

Did they destroy their own planet?<br>I think we have the same future : we use our brain to conquer and expand without end with no respect to other lifeforms.<br>But dolphins are different:though they are very intelligent ,they live their lives without harming anyone , enjoying the life itself.<br>Every lifeform in Earth has a DUAL influence: Asterite and Vortex.The first one lives alone in that undercaves , simply letting the time past , thinking , enjoying its own existence...<br>The Vortex are always seeking a goal and when they get it , then look for another , without end...<br>Dolphins and Humans have very different influences and if we learn to live together , our future will be saved and we shall travel thru the space for more knowledge NOT for saving our lives...||10/21/01 at 14:28:30|asteritius

The Atlanteans had a GREAT technology and never ending knowledge was their GOAL.The had builted machines we can´t even dream of now...and they knew things we´d never imagined.And then they made the Time Machine and saw their own future.Perhaps then they realised what was their true nature , what was the meaning of the path they have chosen as the dolphins and the Asterite did eons before.Their ending was impossible to avoid , only matter of time but they knew that if they would have tried to continue their lives in that way , others lifeforms would vanish for nothing , only to give them a little more time.So they destroyed their city . sunken forever an unbelievable SACRIFICE.Some of them commited suicide BUT others tried to live among the others humans and share with them their knowledge and art .And also their pain... so they had a word to spread : this planet would only survive with a perfect equilibrium between mankind and the rest of lifeforms , a word of balance , justice , culture and peace...These men and women FAILED , these words were soon forgotten , mankind lived , probably , one of its best times , but only for a short brief...and their names and thoughts were erased forever as they´d never existed.So we are following now the path they abandoned centuries before.<br><br>MAN , i have more... but now i think i went too far and &nbsp;i feel jerk|||

She knew that when she started speaking, she would have to be very persuasive. But that would be an easy task for an Atlantean, a daughter of the wisest, most accomplished race of beings on earth. Cassandra took a deep breath, and began...<br><br><br>&quot;My friends, we know owr time here on Earth is coming to an end. A cataclysm will soon befall us and we will be forced to leave our hom. We will take what we can of our knowledge and technology, though we cannot take everything. We must change, but we will survive.<br><br><br>&quot;But what about our fellow beings, all the creatures of this warm, nurturing planet? They will become hostages of the evil that will soon overwhelm this planet? Even worse, they will have to nourish the evil by sacrificing members of there own families!<br><br><br>&quot;I propose that we leave help for them, hidden in a secret place, with a trail of clues leading to it. The evil that is coming will not be smart enough to unravel the puzzle. But an Earth creature of high intelligence can do it, and save the Earth and all living beings.&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;A noble idea, Cassandra,&quot; broke in Nerinee, a highly - respected teacher in the Atlantis society. &quot;But what creature might that be? It would have to be one like us, that can live both underwater and in the air.&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;And your puzzle idea...&quot; added Pella, the mathematician. &quot;The creature would have to be courious enough to look for clues, and tenacious enough to string them together into a solution.&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;What about enemies? Is there a creature strong enough, and fast enough, who still has other qualities?&quot; The questions came flying at Cassandra. &quot;Once we're gond, what other creature is left who could solve a puzzle of our making?&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;I know a race of creatures that live in the sea, though they breathe air,&quot; replied Cassandra. She had caught their attention. If they would just let her talk, she could convince them...<br><br><br>&quot;They originally inhabited the land, but returned to the sea, tenaciously following the fish and other delicacies that were their favorite food, and easy to gather.<br><br><br>&quot;They are superbly suited for the sea, with a sleek built for swiftness and agility. You should watch them swim! With a burst of speed, they can outdo even the fastest longboats. They roll and spin, and leap from the waves in curving flips, whirling around like wheels, sometimes above the water and sometimes under it. They are natural acrobats!<br><br><br>&quot;And dive! I've see them plunge repeatedly, as deep as a hundred longboats, holding their breath twice as long as our best perl diver. They breath through a blowhole at the top of there body, with only the slightest break through the water's surface.<br><br><br>&quot;They are extremely intelligent. My own belief if that they are even more intelligent than many of us. I've watched them work together, herding schools of fish into shallow areas for easyier catching. They post sentinels to protect the group from predators. Once, I saw two of them lift another injured friend above the water at a regular pace so it could breathe.<br><br><br>&quot;They're noisy! I've heard them squawk, chuckle, blat, bark, belch, grunt, pop, click, clap, rasp and whistle, in what is most likely a type of language. Each one makes a distinctive, reconizable whistle that the others imitate. It could be that they're calling each other by name.<br><br><br>&quot;The sounds they make blend together in what i call 'songs.' It seems, in some miraculous way, that they navigate with these songs. I think they send out sound waves that echo back to them with a pattern of their surroundings. If that is true, their &quot;ears&quot; are better than our eyes, because they can navigate even in the dark.<br><br><br>&quot;The older ones, the adults, are about a third again as tall as our taller folks, though I would say they're about three times as heavy. They're able to defend themselves quite well. I've seen them ramming large sharks hard enough to push them out of the water.<br><br><br>&quot;As for solving puzzles, they can learn tricks by mimicking others of there kind. But I've seen them invent tricks of there own. These are creatures with unbounded curiosity and skill.&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;But what, or who, are they?&quot; Cassandra's audience was eager to know.<br><br><br>&quot;The same creatures who help us fish by chasing schools of mullet into owr nets. Perhalps the most intelligent beings on Earth, owr friends the Dolphins.&quot;<br>|||
