I loked around quite a bit but never found a site as good as this one. &nbsp;Anyhow, I shall be joining you on this board when I can (I'm currently attending collage.. it clutters up my schedule quite a bit more then I'd like) &nbsp;and I look forward to getting to know you all. &nbsp;Um.. for those of you that are interested, I'm an artist.. my recent stuff can be found at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.side7.com/art/alexcala/gallery.html&quot;&gt;side7 gallery.&lt;/a&gt;<br>It's all furry and fantasy at the moment, but this site has inspired me to do a lot more underwater/ecco fan art. n_n<br><br>Oh, and happy birthday to Arkonviox! &nbsp;I hope it's a good one.. tis funny, mine was just on the 5th! ^_^ &nbsp;Oh, and Arkon, you never mentioned where you found me..? ^^;; &nbsp;Sorry, I'm just very curious..|||
