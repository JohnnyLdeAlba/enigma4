The article is about sega of france donating money to help clean up the Mediterranean sea and such.<br><br>Theres some minor and major flaws in the article. Ask me how I know :)<br><br>It goes on to talk about their project, "Pelagos", drift netting, and a few other things. It doesn't have anything really do do with ecco other than french sales of the game donate some amount of money to the fund.<br><br>Personally, I'd rather give my money to the campaign to ban methyl tertiary-butyl ether worldwide. Right now it seems much more dangerous to marine systems than anything else.<br>||

Who knows...but if ya ask me...Ecco exists... ;) ...he's out there somewhere, I'm sure of it! You just have to believe...||

If the Asterite existed it'd be put on display, as would Ecco. We have too much to answer for, and I wonder how the world might fare without us? Would it be a paradise? Or would it be worse and desolate? It's an open question, ultimately unanswerable. But what do you think?||

Re: O_O;;; ECCO IS REAL?!?!|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|02/01/02 at 06:42:46|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.112.18|I agree with Tidey and Arkon, sadly. &nbsp;Humans are curious by nature, and want to know as much as possible about things they don't understand. &nbsp;That's why the Asterite, Ecco, and many other Ecco-related things would be put on display were they real. ||
