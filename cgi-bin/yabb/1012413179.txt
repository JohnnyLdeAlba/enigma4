How Could Some People... :'(|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/30/02 at 10:52:56|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.112.18|Listen to this, guys. &nbsp;In my school, we have a Senior Court where the Seniors get to hang out and stuff during study halls or whatever. &nbsp;Well, in the Court are these bunnies - I think there were 7 (there were 2, but then they had babies). &nbsp;Yesterday, we received some shocking, angering, and horrific news - the two older bunnies had been decapitated. &nbsp;Pne of the bunnies had all four legs chopped off, and the other...well, its head was cut off. &nbsp;:'( :'( :'( It makes me so sad and angry that someone could do such a horrendous thing...some people ae just fucked up. &nbsp;<br><br>The teachers tried to tell us it was a hawk.<br><br>Yeah. &nbsp;Fucking. &nbsp;Right. &nbsp;&gt;:(||

Thats relly hurt me watching that but in those days i didn't have the ambition to stop people like that nor the ambition to fight back. <br><br>Thats sad people do that cause they think its funny...||

I remember one day on our playground there was a little baby bunny, so cute. Then this group of kids were all standing around and they're like 'Yeah, let's step on its head!'<br><br>Rabbit didn't live very long.||

Re: How Could Some People... :'(|Jader|jader_me@hotmail.com|01/30/02 at 14:04:50|Jader|xx|0|161.184.59.150|oh that's so sad...I hate when people are cruel to animals. I'ts so mean and the animals are so innocent! One time I saw a bird with it's feet both cut off. It could fly but when it tried to land it just rolled of the roof! I was so upset I wanted to start a hospital were amputee animals could be brought to get replacement limbs...it was a good idea at the time.<br>People who are cruel to animals should die...all those poachers...argh! one little shot and they'd be gone! &gt;:(||

I hate it when people do crap like this :( i heard about this guy on the news who smashed his poor dog's head in with a sledge hammer, and buried it alive :(<br><br>i hope whoever did that will be caught and punished &gt;:(||
Re: How Could Some People... :'(|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/30/02 at 19:39:13|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|Kitnee, good luck finding the perps or getting much results, probably 8 of 10 times schools encourage or overlook senseless violence in one form or another. <br><br>I can rember a time not that long ago when people had more respect for their country and their fellow countryman. One wonders if the current trend to victimization mentality and "correct thinking" isn't just a facade for creating an increasingly frustrated and wayward social model.<br>||01/30/02 at 19:39:50|Shadow

And Trel, that is really wrong - I hope they find and punish the guy, too. &nbsp;:(<br><br>What's really bad is that the babies are alive, but without any parents. I do think, however, that they are old enough to take care of themselves, but still...||

Their defence? they didn't know it was wrong!<br>What the fuck kind of shit is that? you don't know it's wrong to kill someone else? people should have parenting and pet owner licenses. maybe that would keep the abuse rate down to a dull roar...yeah right...<br>and people who plead insanity? i don't think anyone's so insane they don't know what they're doing...oh well people always get what they deserve...hopefully :'(||

Its no wonder then, considering what poor role models televisions make for most people.||
