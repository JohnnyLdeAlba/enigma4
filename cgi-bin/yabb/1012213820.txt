Laying down the law, Crestoe style!|Crestoe|Crestoe@arkonviox.com|01/28/02 at 03:30:18|Crestoe|xx|0|63.253.226.28|This community has turned into a full blown off-topic free-for-all. I expect that to change very rapidly, or you can expect to receive discipline. Follow the rules to the letter or your first warning will be your last one. After that I get to eject you into space.  <br> <br>The Mods are here not only to make sure all forums and their posts stay on track, but also to enforce the nice big list of Rules to follow. The current topics and posts these days are an eyesore and make for very terrible reading due to the negligence of the posters. <br><br>So i'll make this simple on you.<br> <br>Stop posting crap. :P<br>||

It IS an Ecco fan character after all.  But, should it actually go in offtopic since it's not really an official Ecco thing?  I figured it would fit here because I was talking about my Ecco fan character and also my character on the forum, so I figured it would at least relate to the forum.  <br><br>What if we're not certain where something goes?  Cuz there have been some things that kinda go on the borderline.<br><br>And I haven't even seen much that doesn't belong here, in my opinion.||

Thats marine and Ecco stories/artwork.||

The reson I brought that rule up - is because we see so much shit in our General Board that its not funny - just wanna keep it the way you wanted it.||
