Re: Phantasy Star Online|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/28/02 at 19:13:06|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.201.71|I have PSO, but I haven't played it in a very long time.  I hadn't played it enough to get any further than Cave 3.  I love the game, but I just don't play video games much.  And I have no way to get online.||
