*ahem* Presenting.....|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/21/02 at 14:57:05|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Well guys, my website is now functional. There are some parts that have to be thickened up, a' course, but for now, the main idea is there. <br><br>What I'm really excited to announce is that my Ecco fanfic project, 'Chronicles of the Keeper' has finally gone underway! The first chapter is up on the site, as well as an introduction. I originally had the first three chapters done, but at the last minute I decided to change the story's point of view to first person, so I could incorporate each character's personality into the writing. This is basically the first story I've ever done in that point of view, too, so if some of it sounds awkward, please forgive it for now  :-/ . It all comes with practice!<br><br>Now let me see... what else did I want to say...<br><br>Oh yeah! Let me know what you think of the site's layout too, because I was wondering if it was a little weird. Oh, and there's no guestbook (I didn't see a point) so if you need to talk to me about anything particular, please feel free to say so here, or in an e-mail, or a private message... whatever!<br><br>Well, that's about it! I hope the place entertains ya!<br> ;D||01/21/02 at 14:57:43|Delphi

Re: *ahem* Presenting.....|Jader|jader_me@hotmail.com|01/22/02 at 12:10:48|Jader|xx|0|161.184.49.58|WOW! yeah Delphi I didn't go check out your site cuz my computer is so slow but i'm sure I'll see it eventually cuz either you or doomtrain will force me to go there just like doomtrain did for hers. not that it was a bad thing.<br>I'll still give you my red dolphin for your fan art. Won't doomtrain be jealous when you got fan art before she did!<br>if only she didn't whine and beg so much... &nbsp;;D||
Re: *ahem* Presenting.....|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/22/02 at 12:36:10|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Heh heh! Yeah, please give me your dolphin for my site, Jader. But I wouldn't force you to go to my site... I know it wouldn't interest you... &nbsp;8)<br><br>That goes for all of you out there! When my pictures section goes up you can submit pictures for display on the site if you want.||
Re: *ahem* Presenting.....|Jader|jader_me@hotmail.com|01/22/02 at 12:40:06|Jader|xx|0|161.184.49.58|of course it would interest me! how insulting...||
Re: *ahem* Presenting.....|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/22/02 at 12:42:04|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Wow, you're online right now. Well, I'm going to eat some soup. And I'm not insulting you! Just being honest! Really! &nbsp;:'(||
Re: *ahem* Presenting.....|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/22/02 at 13:26:07|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|Yeah Delphi!<br>I've seen it already of course (ha ha, first viewer!), and you already know that I love the layout. I havn't read it yet, but I will later. Hockey game tonight so maybe tomorrow. I'm sure it's great like the rest of your stuff!<br>And I updated too, some fanart. And Jader! If you would just draw me some I wouldn't whine!!! And everyone else, if you want to draw me FF fanart, *hint hint*. I love FF Fanart!<br><br>Keep up the great work Delphi!!!||
Re: *ahem* Presenting.....|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/24/02 at 08:02:56|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Welp, just to let everyone know my first update shouldn't be too far away now... I have a start to the second chapter of CotK and a new midi that's been in the works and nearly done. Plus I've been working on getting the picture part up, but with a Science final tomorrow I really should study, so expect all this to be done by about... mmm... middle of the weekend!<br><br> ;D<br><br>And remember, any comments are appreciated, but I'm mostly concerned with the fic. I'm writing it for the Ecco community, and if you guys don't read it, well... there's no point in me doing it. Catch my drift? So while I know there's only one chapter up right now, I'd love to hear any general ideas you guys have.<br>||
Re: *ahem* Presenting.....|Jader|jader_me@hotmail.com|01/24/02 at 08:53:47|Jader|xx|0|161.184.58.37|Doomtrain I gave you some stupid art now okay! so shush! and Delphi, she has my fanart for you if she hasn't already sent it...||
