Is it just me?|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/23/02 at 15:47:23|Tidesinger|question|0|213.122.92.31|I was looking at our member total. 68, it said. I came back and it said 62! With Kitnee as the newest member! I was like, wtf?!<br>I was wondering, were they banned? If they were, fine. But if they weren't, Arkonviox.com is losing members, fast!||

Windaz was just screwy.. *kicks Virtual PC and clings to Mac OS 9.2.2*||

Re: Is it just me?|Phil Mabong|ze_third_mas@hotmail.com|01/23/02 at 20:59:42|yogoat|xx|0|66.188.111.200|I admit it, I had to "clear out" a few people...when I see that they haven't posted one single thing, I get kinda pissed off, especially when some have relevant IPs...one of these days I'll just delete everyone's account if they haven't posted in a long time.  Thumbs up/down?||

Re: Is it just me?|NeoEcco|neoecco1@hotmail.com|01/23/02 at 22:58:35|NeoEcco|xx|0|12.232.110.252|agreed... it is certainly not worth the space here to keep accounts on people who truly do not wish to become an active part of the community... <br><br>they probably simply do it just because it was a passing fancy; just sign up to a sight that looks fascinating, but never really do anything to earn that account... i would suggest setting up a set period of time that would state how long an inactive member should have an account before it is deleted... unless you have already set one up, then by all means do what you feel is right in such a situation ;)||

But we shouldn't let em stay if they're inactive. Not that it matters about my opinion. <br><br>So now no1 can moan that I always post. I have a reason!||

I don't often have access to the internet since I'm on school holidays, so I can't post as much as I'd like to &nbsp;:-[||
Re: Is it just me?|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/25/02 at 21:52:14|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.32|I think it's a good idea, but it means people will have to announce when they are going to be gone.  Also, you have to take into account that some people may just be busy and haven't had time to access the forum and therefore don't have the opportunity to say why they haven't been around.  I think that people who have been frequent posters for a long time should get more time as they are more likely to come back.  Also you should make sure new people know about this, because it wouldn't be exactly fair if they were just on vacation or something and didn't know they had to announce it first.||

Re: Is it just me?|dolphingirl|dolphingirl@arkonviox.com|01/27/02 at 19:20:43|dolphingirl|xx|0|63.200.107.30|Actually...contrary to most everyone's opinions here...I tend to think differently. I mean...what's it hurting having a registered account here that's not very active...I mean, I can understand if it's been like 6 months or something since the last activity...but...what if someone has a personal life problem or issue...and they just don't make it here for a long while. If i couldn't come...and came back later...to an erased account...I'd be pissed off. Now, that's not to say it's okay to just up and leave for a long time...but...I think a larger time span of inactivity would be better...I mean, heck...it's not like they're taking up any space...right?! Not like this site's so busy inactive accounts bog things down right? Heck...I could be totally wrong...but I don't see the problem. Who cares if there's a long member list...and some don't ever show...what's the big deal...heheh...I dunno, I just don't see the point. But, maybe I'm just in a mood er something...take what I've said as a grain of salt I guess...pay no attention to the moody talkative dolphingirl over here.....heh... ::)||
