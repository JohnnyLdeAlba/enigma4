trying to find this game|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/23/01 at 21:34:57|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.195.48|First of all I'm wondering why my avatar isn't working. &nbsp;Is it working for everyone else?<br><br>Well here's the reason why I posted this topic. &nbsp;I finally decided that maybe I should try seeing if anybody here can help me. &nbsp;I was hoping somebody might know the name of this one RPG. &nbsp;It was the first RPG I had ever played--I rented it about two or three times, years ago. &nbsp;It's a Genesis game. &nbsp;It was a great game, although I never did get very far. &nbsp;I wasn't familiar with that style of game which made it harder, and for me RPG's are generally hard. &nbsp;And then there's the fact I pretty much suck at all video games...but that's beside the point. &nbsp;The point is I can't remember the title and I want to figure out what it was, and hopefully I could then find it somewhere. I'll describe what I can remember about it.<br><br>There were four characters. &nbsp;The instruction manual had pictures of each of them, I think black and white, and I actually tried drawing them all. &nbsp;I recently found the paper that I drew them on, and so that is the most solid thing I have of it. &nbsp;I wrote the names, too. &nbsp;I don't have that paper with me, since it's at the cottage (and chances are we won't go back until summer), but I have a fairly good image in my head. &nbsp;The main character, the hero, didn't have a name--you had to give him one. &nbsp;He had green hair and, I think, a green outfit. &nbsp;There was an elf named....crap, her name escapes me for now...but she had long, blond hair and wore a red cape and had a pink outfit--she was labeled as a cleric. &nbsp;There was a girl named Midi who had short pink hair and she was labeled as a scout. &nbsp;Then there was a guy with long brown hair tied up, wearing a blue cloak, and labeled as a Monk, and his name was Elrad.<br><br>I never actually got anywhere in the game, at least not when I started my own game. &nbsp;Most of the time I played a game that somebody else had started, where they had all 4 characters. &nbsp;But here's what I remember from the begginning of the game. &nbsp;You start out where your in a castle and your being told you have to go out on some mission--I don't remember at all what it was. &nbsp;Then the characetr goes outside the castle and into the city, and that's when you gain control. &nbsp;You apparantly go through different ranks, which is explained in the very begginning, and you start out as a squire. &nbsp;In the other game somebody started, he was something else. &nbsp;I don't know if the other characters also go through ranks. &nbsp;You have to go through a forest, and you can see the monsters and have a chance of avoiding them. &nbsp;But if you touch one you go into battle. &nbsp;In that way it is like Lunar. &nbsp;And then to get from place to place on the map, it's different from other RPG's I've played. &nbsp;The character kinda turns into a cursor, except it still looks like the character, and then there are lines...and you press the direction pad and it takes you to a city or a &quot;dungeon&quot; type of place (where you have to fight monsters), and you have to press a button to enter. &nbsp;You have to clear out certain &quot;dungeons&quot; (ike the forest I mentioned earlier&quot; in order to get to the next city or whatever other place you're trying to get to. &nbsp;But when you clear one area, it will open up from one to three (or possibly more, but I wouldn't know) different ways you can go. &nbsp;But when you are in one of those places, it looks like most other turn-based RPG's, but I think it reminds me most of Phantasy Star IV as far as the way the cities and other places look, except that you can see the monsters like in Lunar. <br><br>I'm remembering a bit more as I go. &nbsp;Most of what I remember comes from when I was playing the game somebody else started. &nbsp;There were scenes like in any other RPG, but there weren't any animations or anything. &nbsp;In Phantasy Star IV, they showed faces and picturesof the characters doing things in the scenes, but this game didn't even have anything like that. &nbsp;It just looked like any other time in the game, and the people would be talking. &nbsp;Well there might have been a few animations. &nbsp;I only remember seeing one scene. &nbsp;That did have an animation, actually. &nbsp;I remember seeing something similar to a hang glider going over a place where a bridge had fallen. &nbsp;I remember the characters talking to some old guy before that, but I'm not sure it was really a scene, it was just like when you talk to one of the people in the city but it had importance. &nbsp;<br><br>Hmmm...that covers about the estent of what I can remember from that game. &nbsp;I hope somebody might have some clue as to what that game was. &nbsp;I'd really like to find it, because I liked it a lot. &nbsp;After renting it a few times, it dissappeared from the rental place. &nbsp;And I forgot all about it until recently. &nbsp;So I thought I might see if anyone knows what it is.||

Re: trying to find this game|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/24/01 at 20:20:35|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.57|erk...o.o &nbsp;I dunno, but that doesn't ring a bell.<br><br>I was thinking the title had a word like &quot;kingdom&quot; or &quot;king&quot; in it...but maybe I'm just thinking of King's Quest...I dunno...<br><br>The problem is there is no guarantee I would know the name if I heard it, but it should at least sound familiar. &nbsp;Actually, you know, Shining Force sounds somewhat familar, but it could be that I just heard of it. &nbsp;I really have no clue if that's it or not. &nbsp;Maybe if someone could find me some information on it or at least screen shots or even so much as a picture of the cover...anything which I could look at so that I could identify whether or not Shining Force is the right game.<br><br>Or if anybody has any other ideas...||
Re: trying to find this game|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|12/28/01 at 20:13:27|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Why don't you go to any big old search engine and look up information on Shining Force or something, so you can see if it is that game? Or maybe you should just look under 'old Genesis RPGs' ;)<br><br>Sorry, I know I'm not a bunch of help.<br><br>I loved Phantasy Star IV, by the way. Greatest RPG I've ever played. EVER.||
Re: trying to find this game|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/28/01 at 21:11:44|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.176|Yes, I agree PSIV was the best, even tho I haven't really played any others in the series. &nbsp;In fact, the reason I played it first was because I had gone to the video rental place (I can't remember if we had Chart Hits back then or not, but it was in the same area) and I couldn't find that game I was talking about. &nbsp;They no longer had it, nor would they have it ever again. &nbsp;I had no idea what an RPG was at the time. &nbsp;I think part of the thrill of that game was the fact I had never seen anything like it. &nbsp;So I decided to search for anything that looked like it might be a similar type of game, and I found Phantasy Star IV. &nbsp;It was the title that caught my eye at first, because somehow it just made it sound like it might be the same type of game, and I looked at the back of the box and saw the pictures and it looked similar enough. &nbsp;Than I read what it said and thought it sounded really cool. &nbsp;I haven't really played many RPG's, and I haven't even owned any until recently, but so far PSIV was the best.<br><br>I thought about just looking up &quot;Shining Force.&quot; &nbsp;I don't know why I didn't, but I think I shall now. &nbsp;I'm not sure just how much I'll find if it's an old game, but then again, there are thousands of Phantasy Star sites out there.||
Re: trying to find this game|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/28/01 at 21:32:16|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.176|Nope. &nbsp;Looked at all three games. &nbsp;Not even close. &nbsp;Possibly the gameplay is similar, but I remember what the characters looked like. &nbsp;I couldn't describe them in detail, but I can visualize the pictures from he manual pretty well. &nbsp;So that would be the strongest thing to go by for me. &nbsp;In fact, the first Shining Force game has several characters. &nbsp;But this game that I was describing, as I said, had only 4. &nbsp;Since only those four were listed and illustrated in the booklet, I assume there aren't any other minor characters that join the party at any time. &nbsp;Tho it's possible. &nbsp;I never got very far. &nbsp;And I have a somewhat clear image of how they looked onscreen. &nbsp;And when they talked, it didn't show any face pictures. &nbsp;There were never any images at all in the game besides what you saw while wondering around in cities and on the map and in battle.||

I've asked a bunch of Sega buffs at this other forum to help. Maybe one of them will know. I told them just what you said, so hopfully they'll know. I'll get back to you when I hear something about it.<br>||

Re: trying to find this game|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/06/02 at 17:35:58|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|Hmmm...well no one seems to know what it is. &nbsp;:P But I'll let you know if someone does.||
