Art for Sale.|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|12/31/01 at 21:27:25|Swift_Current|exclamation|0|209.197.174.31|Well...I'm finally going to do it. I'm putting one of my dolphin paintings up for sale. It's not large, but it did turn out nice. :)<br><br>It's 9&quot;x12&quot;, done on Canvas paper (which is easier to mail), and I used Acrylic paints as always. The picture can be seen on my site.<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/blackfox71/index.htm<br><br>Go to the gallery. The image I'm selling is the one on the very bottom, below the picture of Trellia. &quot;Comming of Storm.&quot; is the title.<br><br>I'll be selling it on Furbid within the next few days. It will be in the General (PG-13) auction section.<br><br>Here's Furbid's URL: http://www.furbid.ws/<br><br>I would give out the direct url, but I haven't begun the auction yet. I might do it some time tomorrow. When I do, I'll give you all the direct url to the actual page. &nbsp;;)<br>||

That's why I desided to sell some art off.... I might be offering a commission sometime soon also, even if doing so means cutting back on my internet time. <br><br>I absolutely NEED cash right now, I'm trying to keep my pets and myself fed at the same time as savin' for a trip down south to visit friends....and that ain't easy on a minimum wage paycheck. &nbsp;:-/ <br><br>Ok, I'll stop blabbin' about my debt problems now...guess I'll just go off and draw something.||

I didn't think I was [i]that[/i] secretive about it after leaving a few subtle hints here on this thread. The one that comes to mind is when I sat back and watched the bickering going on way early on in the auction. I thought, there was no point in joining in...there was still lots of time for things to happen. Plus, I seem to remember telling Swift to make sure she let us know if she was auctioning off any dolphin art...why else...because I was interested! I remember posting also at one time that I sooo hoped to one day own a piece by her...and now, at last...one of my dreams came true... ;D ...thank you for sharing your gorgeous artwork Swift!!! Oh, one correction...vantid, you would've [i][b]tried[/i][/b] to snipe my ass...but, I'm sorry to say (no wait, actually I'm not)...you sure as hell wouldn't have succeeded... :devil: ...mwa ha haah!||

I had a funny feeling you'd jump into the auction late in the game and maybe even win it at the last hour....and of course, you did!  ;)<br><br>No worries tho', just to make it up to Arkie I might offer him a private sale sometime in the future, since he's so damn serious about wanting to own some pic' of mine... XD<br><br>And as for Van', she's getting an origonal of mine anyway (of her dragon-furry character), as a trade! I just need to know if she's ready for me to mail it to her...silly water dragon... ;D ||
