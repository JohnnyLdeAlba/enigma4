Thats cause with the help of Dark Dolphin we formed a IRC Server Network.<br><br>Basically heres the changes, you can create your own chat rooms. Register with nickserv and chanserv. <br><br>My power, instead of the old kicks and bans i have newer more pwoerful tools that can get rid of a person in a flash. One is called the Kill and the K-line.<br><br>The network is located on 206.42.160.135 if your using mirc or equivlent type in /server 206.42.160.135 <br><br>Soon enough we will work with other websites to get them to join owr server, and trust me once we form a giant alliance with more websites we will rule the world!||

Re: Arkonviox.com IRC Network Up|dolphingirl|dolphingirl@arkonviox.com|01/18/02 at 19:55:35|dolphingirl|xx|0|63.196.189.190|Anyone trying to add the new server to their list of "IRC Servers" (for example if you're using mIRC)...I can tell you what I did to add it, and it works just fine.<br><br>In the "mIRC Options" window (what pops up upon starting the program, or what you get when you click on the button that looks like a file folder with a hammer next to it)...there's 4 buttons in the upper right-hand corner. Click on "Add" and you'll need to fill out the info in the window that will appear. You can fill it out as shown below (how I did it), or you can change the description if you wish, but everything else must be there.<br><br>Description: dolphinparadise.net<br>IRC Server: 206.42.160.135<br>Port(s): 6667<br>Group: (left it blank)<br>Password: (left it blank)<br><br>After filling all that out, click on "Add"...and you should be ready to go! Now, to find the server you just added, I'll explain what I had to do. Okay, in that same "mIRC Options" window, at the top is where you select which of the "IRC Servers" you want to connect to. Use the pull-down-arrow, and from that list, go to the very top and choose "All"...then in the bar underneath that, use the pull-down-arrow again to choose the server you just added. It should be all the way down at the very bottom. If you entered the info as I did, you will select "dolphinparadise.net"...or whatever you entered as your "Description". Make sense? Anyway, once those are set, you connect...and presto! Yer on! Hope that helps some of you who use mIRC...as I too was confused the first time I added a server to my list. Seeya there hopefully... ;)||
