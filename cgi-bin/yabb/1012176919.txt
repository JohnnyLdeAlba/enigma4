Ecco the Dolphin confirmed for GBA|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/27/02 at 17:15:15|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.26.114|Please note that this news is also in the news board.<br><br>" THQ revealed the games that would encompass the previously announced Sega Smash Pack game that will be released on the Game Boy Advance this spring.<br><br>The Smash Pack brand started on the Sega Dreamcast as a series of compilation of emulated Sega Genesis titles. Sega Smash Pack for the Game Boy Advance is a compilation of three direct ports of classic Sega Genesis games: Golden Axe, Ecco the Dolphin and Sonic Spinball.<br><br>Golden Axe (pictured here) is a fantasy brawler where players pick from three distinct warriors, set out to defeat the Evil Death Adder and his minions. The GBA port will feature single player action (no link play for two players), and have three modes of play: Arcade Mode, Easy Mode, and Duel Mode.<br><br>Ecco the Dolphin puts gamers in the role of the popular marine mammal in his debut role...he must set out to rescue his lost dolphin buddies, all the while avoiding hazardous sea life and befriending others.<br><br>Sonic Spinball puts Sonic the Hedgehog in the role of a ball trapped in a huge pinball world. Using your mad pinball skills, flip Sonic around in four huge levels to defeat Dr. Robotnik one more time.<br><br>Sega Smash Pack is in development at Codefire, and will be published by THQ. We'll have more screens of Ecco and Sonic Spinball as soon as they're available."<br><br>:)||

Hopefully it will have the Ecco PC levels and the Stomach... but Sega of America probly wun do that :D. It will most likely have better sounding music using the SNES enhanced sound card in the little buggers of a handheld and yeah :). I'm gonna be the first to find the rom! 0o;; *hunts*||

And, Ecco DotF on a handheld...hahah...yea right. I'd like to see that...I don't think they could do it! But, then again, I could be wrong...||

Re: Ecco the Dolphin confirmed for GBA|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/30/02 at 16:01:59|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.24.114|Arkon: *pokes* You can't read that well can you? <br><br>" 'Ecco the Dolphin puts gamers in the role of the popular marine mammal in his debut role...he must set out to rescue his lost dolphin buddies, all the while avoiding hazardous sea life and befriending others.' " :D In otherwords, the storm takes his pod, he goes to get them back. <br><br>I think it'll have some improvements... perhapse if they go on and do Ecco 2 as well - they may make Ecco 3 in almost a Mega Drive format! :D ^_^ I'll keep you guys posted on this, I must find screenshots for it.. x.x;;<br>||
