Crestoe's Lackeys o.o;;;;|Crestoe|Crestoe@arkonviox.com|01/16/02 at 23:07:04|Crestoe|xx|0|63.253.227.70|Ive already appointed 2 ppl for my lackeys.<br><br>WhiteFin and Histronic, cuz in my opinion, they both made damn good moderators.<br>My Lackeys are moderators apointed by me whenver the hell i feel like it. o.o;;;;;<br><br>They havent been set up becuz im awaiting Arkon to set up the Lackeys witht he Mods powers n stuff.<br><br>So just a warning, Crestoe's lackeys are EVIL. o.o<br>I shall poor butter on them and have them...sit on furniture! Bwhahahaha! Then you'll have butter on it!<br><br>Or....Put their drink on yer desk...ehh....Without costers!<br><br>Naw, but seriously, I will hopefully be asigning them tommorow.<br>I have to wait for Arkon to fix their powers. Poor Arkon had to work night shift inventory at work, so go easy on the guy. He's been workin his ass off to make things work better here. So if he acts a bit grumpy, just forgive em for it. He needs some sleep. o_o<br><br>As for me, i have to get my ass finishing the new episode of the blundercaves for its second season. Hopefully, i can asure you new ideas. Meaning I'll probably not have porposegirl get caught on fire...i'll have her get beaten with a wrench... O_o;;;;<br><br>Anyhow, thats all for now.||
