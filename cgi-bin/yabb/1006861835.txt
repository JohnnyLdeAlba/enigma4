Re: E-Mail Virus Alert!|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|11/27/01 at 17:02:21|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.170.166|The Worm was talked about on the news today. It's a nasty little bug that hacks your PC and leaves a back door open for any hacker to get to your personal files. &nbsp;Anything with a pif tag on it is most likely a file carrying the virus. Keep your eyes peeled and let all your friends know about it. <br><br>I have enough trouble with my PC WITHOUT havin' any viruses on it. &nbsp;:P<br>||
