I'm SORRY!|Jader|jader_me@hotmail.com|01/06/02 at 13:08:30|Jader|exclamation|0|161.184.44.226|This topic is for apologies.<br><br>I am sorry for pissing people off. I am sorry for writing certain things about people. I will not be so annoying in the future, not try just not be. If you take offence to anything I've posted I'm sorry but i didn't mean it. I just happen to be very cynical and sarcastic and when the opportunity presents itself and just have to take it.<br>By the way yogoat and Crestoe i'm not trying to be i smart ass in doing this, nor am i trying to suck up, or keep myself from getting banned (something that has been threatened many times)<br>I just figured it was extremely bad luck to have made so many enemies, get kicked off chat so many times, and be threatened to be banned so many times when i haven't even been a part of this site for a week yet. That should be i record! j/k I 'm sorry!<br>Very, very, very sorry! And i won't piss you off in the future.<br>and if i do, sorry in advance!<br>:cry:||

Re: I'm SORRY!|Jader|jader_me@hotmail.com|01/07/02 at 19:28:39|Jader|xx|0|161.184.58.35|For one thing I am not paranoid! I just thought...I don't know what I thought, probably nothing...Nevermind. Yes I am Delphi and Doomtrain's friend. And Arkon you probably wouldn't remember but doomtrain and I wanted to be in the Blundercaves (a suggestion which we retract, by the way, or at least I do) and for Sir Wormshire:<br>1. I am a GIRL! so it should be riding her ass, unless you miss typed or something...<br>2. I don't think getting kicked off means they like you and besides I get kicked kicked off because some people can't handle my sarcastic views. <br>Geez you try to make peace and what do you get in return...nothing...||
