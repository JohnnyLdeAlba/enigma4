Re: No more mods...and everyones out of the clan|Trellia|Liz_2emeadow@hotmail.com|01/03/02 at 23:17:37|Trellia|xx|0|24.78.125.249|i totally understand arkon, but i was gonna say one thing: of all the time ive been @ the forum, ive hardly ever seen anyone move, lock, or delete topics. No one, except for you that is. I dont think any of us were ever quite sure wat level of &quot;moderation&quot; we were supposed to be on. I think sometime we think to lock a topic, then think &quot;what if arkon doesnt want it locked?&quot; but then again, this may be a good reason to take away our mod status for now. Since i saw wat D-12 has been up to, i think he may try bigger ways to get to this site, and you probably want to be in control of every thing.<br><br>but anyway, I for one am not mad. ^^ I completely understand wat u are feeling with people lurking around the forum and site. Just maybe we can try again with the mod stuff once things get figured out. but then again, maybe not. :) &quot;cuz its ur website and you should be able to do whatever the fuck you feel.&quot; ;)<br><br>Best wishes about destroying the lurker too! ^^;;<br>~Trellia||

Perosnally blackfin said it once himself that the job protecting the website has to be in the hands of the one who runs it.<br><br>Besides you and whitefin got your own yabb forum. speaking of which would you like me to add the new feature i was talking about the one that allows administrators to use html?<br><br><font size=4>Ha ha ha ha</font><br><br><table bgcolor="black"><tr><td>???</td></tr></table><br><br>anyhow trellia you pinpointed it perfectly. I made a mistake when i said you werent doing your jobs i think you were right and that you didnt know when was a good time to lock a topic or delete it. Thats why being a mod on my site cant relly be done unless your a person who can read my mind. and Crestoe is the closest they come since he knows me as a brother and all...<br><br>anyhow you got your site as well as whitefin you should be okay without being mods here. once again i didnt see it relly working. theres a site on my affiliates called legendofzelda and the whole site is people in a forum that are all mods. and most have it for the title!||01/03/02 at 23:33:48|Arkonviox

I feel like Trellia summed it up good...I never knew what to do with what post...when...and how you'd feel about it...like you said, we'd have to read yer mind. And, believe me...if you ever find a chick who can read yer mind...ya'd better keep her! Cus...that'd be a rare occasion indeed...hehehe!||

Stayed over her house for 2 nights - so I wasn't able to view the forum. I think what you did was right :) I habve locked and moved a few topics before, but only a few ^_^ But I can still happilly guard the forum when everyone else is not on. :)<br><br>~Whitefin||
