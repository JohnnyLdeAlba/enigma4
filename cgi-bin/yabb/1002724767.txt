The Whitefin Trilogy - Updated 16 Oct.!|Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|10/10/01 at 08:39:27|Whitefin|xx|0|144.137.80.43|Meh, short so far, but I will post more of it when I write more of it *zz*<br>Basic summery is that the Vortex kind return, and they have evolved highly *see my Some New Art post in the General Board for what the new Queen looks like.* They intend to nest on Earth again, but in Atlantis, so they have free use to what is left of the Time Machine. It's a race against time to save the  dolphin kind.<br>R&amp;R of what little snippits i've writen.<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Whitefin appeared in a swirl of bubbles in what would be an unknown sea, but she knew where she was perfectly. Whitefin swam out of the cavern she arrived in and made her way to the surface.<br><br>The Whitefin Trilogy - Book One<br>Part One<br>Trellia's Bay<br><br>Whitefin surfaced, her reptillian crest shifted in a breathing motion as they absorbed the air.<br>&quot;Whitefin!&quot; A srill sweet voice of delight cried out. Whitefin looked above her only to come beak to beak with a great dolphin. &quot;Hey Trellia&quot; The Atlantean said, a usual cool edge to her voice.<br>&quot;I never knew you'd come today&quot; Trellia said as she 'swam' into a better view for her friend singer. &quot;Us time keepers need to keep track of their friends&quot; Whitefin laughed.<br>Whitefin usually acted as a coldhearted dolphin, but she was truly friendly.<br>Trellia smirked ina delphinic way as she lifted Whitefin from the waters and held onto her with her aura. Whitefin smiled snugly, she enjoyed a little flying at times.<br><br>But as the two where enjoying themselves...<br><br>Atlantis' deep enemy emerged from what was left of the Time Machine, her newly formed body piercing the waters. &quot;The oceans shall be mine... along with the rest of this primative planet!&quot; and with that, the being let out a haunting laugh. The new hive was to start, here in the sunken city...<br><br>Whitefin let out a wail of pain, Trellia dropped her in surprise. ~SPLARSH!!~ Whitefin hit the water, she looked highly dazed and scared. &quot;Whitefin?&quot; Trellia asked, grabbing her friend with her oddly large fins and moving her to a small rock island. &quot;Somethings-wrong&quot; Whitefin said, as she pulled herself onto the rock slightly with her large fins.<br>Atlantis....<br><br><br>Part Two<br>Evolution<br><br>The waters of Earth started to churn, as if crying for help. Even in the future, the ocean was seeminly dying.||10/16/01 at 04:00:41|Whitefin

Re: The Whitefin Trilogy|Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|10/16/01 at 00:26:53|Whitefin|xx|0|144.137.80.43|Update :), Small one, but I'm doing this between school.<br><br>Part Two<br>Evolution<br><br>The waters of Earth started to churn, as if crying for help. Even in the future, the ocean was seemingly dying. Pods of all species hid in the shadows, and even the great Slayer stayed well hidden.<br>From the depths of Atlantis came a great surging force, like a sonic wave, that stripped the ocean bare around the city. &quot;Can you hear the cries of the ocean?&quot; The Queen asked to her fellow kind, a toothy grin playing her face. They all nodded in agreement.<br>The Vortex Kind had evolved into a greater force! The queen had learnt to adapt and evolve when she was trapped in the past. Now the Vortex wanted revenge, and now that Ecco was trapped in the oceans of time, it would be easier for them. There was one problem that would prove to be irritating for them -- The Past Singer. The Queen knew that Whitefin had great knowledge of the Vortex kind, she was also one of the last survivors of the attack on the once great city. |||
