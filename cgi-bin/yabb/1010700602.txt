Story of Arkonviox|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|01/10/02 at 15:10:00|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.6.64|St.Gabriel was an arkangel if god, a messanger. And the highest of the angels as a human man. As a messanger of god, he would tell the earth of god and his wishes. He defied god by lieng and forging the messages of him into Gabriels own wishes. God punished him by banishing him into the sea and turning him into a dolphin. The dolphins face was scorhed of his human face, meaning that his dolphin face features were similar to his human.<br> The dolphin attempted to fight god, but lost as half his face was ripped from his head and a golden mask which pleagued his face like a flesh eating poisong covered in its place.<br>The dolphin, once a human, wore cloths like a man. wearing a dark purple cloak, resembling a human without arms, but moved through the water like a spirit. The dolphin gabriel vowed the destruction of god.<br> For many centuries, the dolphin was able to stay alive, driven by anger and his never ending fight to destroy god. He was known as an earth god, but evil.<br>Although gabirel could never win, he continued<br>until god finally put him to his end by burdening his soul into his own hatred and banishing it into the earth.<br> until the time of atlantis, a dolphinade of the old world was born into the very same hatred<br>the dolphins name was Akren.<br> unlike his fellow blood, the dolphin was a tan with red eyes, and his fin was miss shaped backwards, and his tail fin ressembled the bone structure of bird wings,<br> and the burdened face of him from the scars made my his mask.<br>Akrens originial desires were to dominate atlantis, until he was layed into dorment by Atla<br>Akren would be recreated...<br> with a mask like gabriels which poisoned his face<br>This recreation was called "The project Arkonviox"<br> and gabriel was reborn for the 3rd time.<br>And that as they say is that. Thats is who gariel is. That is who Akren is, and that is who Arkonviox was.<br>Arkons armor he wears is called "Wings" The Wings are an armor created by atla. Basicly, the stronger the wearer gets, the more the armor starts to take shape when it does. Arkonviox too, also changed. But on a normal dolphin, it doesnt. Arkons form changes when he gets stronger, so does his armor. A normal dolphin will get stronger but the dolphin will remain. The armor will still grow.<br> 3 types of Wings wre created<br> the wings of burden, the wings of intervention, and the wings of time<br>The 3 horned beasts.<br> Intervention, Sitnas internal armor<br>4 awakening demons<br> and the wings of time. The ultimate power.||01/11/02 at 00:50:07|Arkonviox
