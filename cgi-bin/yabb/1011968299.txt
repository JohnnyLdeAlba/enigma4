Re: A preview|vantid|vantid@arkonviox.com|01/25/02 at 07:31:47|vantid|xx|0|207.80.104.200|uhhh....bluepencil? i use blue colored pencils when i color my stuff. *loox at red x's* sorry folx....for some reason the image trues to lonk to the c drive instead of the uploaded image. mebbe arkon can fix it since the pix that are supposed to show up are uploaded.<br><br>what do you mean "bluepencil?"||
Re: A preview|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/25/02 at 07:45:37|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|Bluepencil as in non-photo blue. One of my friends uses it almost exclusivly now for sketches that will be inked, since bluepencil does not have to be erased normally. Eraser marks on inked work is just well, ugh.||

Re: A preview|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/25/02 at 21:05:17|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.161|These are great, Vantid!  Although I don't draw dolphins much, but as it is I can't do anything but side veiws. So this would help in the respect.  And when you have the part about coloring, that will help too.  One thing I need to learn is how to make the effect of water.  But, the problem is, whenever I try to draw something by following step-by-step instructions like that, like in those drawing books, it always turns out bad.  But when I draw the same thing without using the instructions, it turns out a lot better.  But it will be worth a shot the next time I decide to draw a dolphin.||

You've excelled yourself, Van.<br>But, like everyone else, my pc makes the clunky noise too when I go onto your page.<br>On the plus side though, I've printed it off and used it in school.

Re: A preview|Miana|echolee5@hotmail.com|01/30/02 at 18:39:46|Echo_Lee|xx|0|165.247.70.197|Okay, mesa got my artwork here, two of 'em actually. ^^ I'll provide links since the image thing hates me.<br><br>http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/DisplayImg.pl?INO=81236<br><br>This is a scene in my story, whenever I get to it... Ecco reforming from the Celestial Sea back into Earth. I think it turned out good despite this scanner. I gotta get someone to look at it. &gt;.&lt; This is a negative of the original, it looked a helluva lot more better<br><br>http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/DisplayImg.pl?INO=81241<br><br>Now this is from using Vantid's guidelines (the inking sucks I know) This is the Underworld Pod, the pod Ecco joins after being killed by the Vortex Queen (who is then killed by Hemiko, Ecco's mate and Ecka, Ecco's little sister) At the time I drew it I thought Saturn was the Roman god of the Underworld, but than I discover it was actually Pluto, after inking it. So... (beats head on the wall) I guess they're passing over it or something.<br><br><br>I hope you all like 'em. And Arkon feel free to put these images up if you like.||

I love 'em.<br><br>And to answer your questions DG.<br>The Rebirth were drawn with a Pro art pencil, forgot what actual code it was or whatever you call it. The Saturn one drawn with your everyday number 2 pencil, both inked by the same pen and both on computer paper.||
