Oh well. I guess I could get off my ass and get a real job for my PSX2, instead of working with stock at Zellers...but that would just take out of my video game time when I got it! ^_-<br>I got pretty much everything you could think of with lepord print on it, cause my room is like an africian Tiki Lounge.<br>It was a good christmas!||
