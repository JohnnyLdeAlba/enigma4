Who's the artist?|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|12/27/01 at 19:08:06|Doomtrain|question|0|24.64.138.131|Hey there! I was just wondering who the artist was in here that did those awesome pics for Arkon and Crestoe? They look great! Real talent there. There was some fanart I'd seen in here too that looked just as good. Is that the same person? And I just want to comment on how it says &quot;I own you all&quot; above the two. I though that was damn hilarious. How true it is.||
