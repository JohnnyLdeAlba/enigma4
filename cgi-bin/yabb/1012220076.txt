Yesterday I had Spanish, and that was OK, too. Today was History...man, I really, truly think I failed that one. It was HARD! I took one look at it and my head went BOOOOOM!! :freak6:||

Math was a breeze for me (my one and only strong subject), but religion was another story. Usualy I just choose the answer &quot;pray&quot;...but this time it wasn't an option! -_- So I think I failed that, but the essay was easy. I would have had Social, but I exemted that since my teacher was brain dead and I hadn't learned anything all year. @_@ The fool! I'm never having him again!<br>I hope you did well on your midterms Kitnee! I'm sure you did ^_-<br>Oh god...midtearm....mid-point..... M = (x2-x1/2 , y2-y1/2)<br>Ah! To much math!!! I don't even think that's right! &nbsp;:P||

O_o &nbsp;And I [i]would[/i] be good in Algebra II...except for the fact that my teacher ish a bitch and she cannot teach for crap! :P &nbsp;Boy, I remember when I was in Algebra I...I got [i]As[/i], man!! Now it's just like, &quot;OK, and [i]what[/i] exactly did you just say?&quot;<br><br>Hope you did good on your finals, Doom! ;D||

I don't know if it's the same other places, but here Seniors don't have to take final exams, unless you're failing a class.  But, I know you have a lot in college, and I'm going next year.<br><br>For a couple days I didn't have time to visit this site.  I hope that things will slow down a bit once we get settled into the new semester.<br><br>A class on religion, Doom?  I'm guessing you attend a private school.  Because I've never heard of a class like that.<br><br>I'm so glad Trig is over.  I had troubkle with a lot of things.  But, now I have Probability and Statistics.  So far ir's easy, but we haven't even gotten into numbers yet.  I had a bit of a problem with probabilty in Advanced Algebra last year, so I have a feeling this class will become difficult for me later on.||

I can't wait to get out of high school! &gt;_&lt; I'm so oppressed..||
