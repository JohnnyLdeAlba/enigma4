Oh well, I hate the backstreet boys and those maniac tinyboppers at my school have me on a hit list now. So, to each there own I guess. I like the Bell Carol and Oh holy night. Silent night too I guess. But what is with that Rudy the Red neck reindeer song??? ||

Though, in writing this, I've thought of many others too that are up there on the list...I truely like them all...mostly the old traditional ones...God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, What Child Is This, Oh Holy Night...and some newer ones too...oooh! Grandma Got Ran Over By a Reindeer is a great one too...heheh! It all depends on the mood/situation...there's tons of excellent Christmas songs out there! [i]*leaves topic humming songs*[/i]||
