Then you'll get your replies... ;) ...anyway, it's nice to meet you Kaxan...welcome to the site! I'm curious though about something...how did your friend know about this site...did he/she come here? Do we know them? Anyway, the &quot;blackfin&quot; person of which you speak of no longer comes to Ecco sites... :( ...he only exists in memories now (good ones for some of us). Hopefully knowing he's not here won't let you down...and you'll still continue to come. It's always nice seeing new faces around here! So, are you an Ecco fan yerself? Well, seeya around, and again, welcome to the site... ;D||
