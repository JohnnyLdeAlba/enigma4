I'd probably be an administrator by now if i hadn't left....<br>2. I stuck with Arkon through all the major (and minor) site wars<br>3. I come here every day<br>4. as to win extra points, psybandit is a crybaby and he should get over snackfin leaving and accept arkonviox's unquestionable dominance of the ecco world<br>5. I don't really delete topics for no reason.... like if someone attacks me or if someone i dont like posts<br>6. Everybody who isn't a fucking fag likes me ^_^<br>7. I've been here seriously fucking long<br>8. I know how to use the yabb thank you....<br>9. I've got more good reasons than everyone else! &nbsp;Hell, even my psybandit is a crybaby line was more convincing than everyone else's<br><br>Whatcha think?||

And since the fact has already been acknowledged that a certain psy----- is indeed a cry baby, I'll leave it up to your natural genus and assume that you already know that. =)<br><br>Why should I be mod?<br><br>1. I'm an occasionally nice guy.<br>2. I come here multiple times a day (yup, sad).<br>3. Only I know the recepie for Arky-Snacks (under lock and key for the time being...)<br>4. I use parinthises and periods all the time (...).<br>5. I try to make my posts make sense...<br>6. ...sometimes...<br>7. Only I would have Miss Cleo for my avatar (eat this artists!).<br>8. I have a Hello Kitty doll from Burger King that I use for target practice because short of Miss Cleo, Hello Kitty is the devil.<br>9. I'll be your best buddy should you vote for me.<br>10. I don't go on crazy streaks and delete posts because someone calls me an asshole or other interesting name.<br>11. I can spell better then the creator of this site (kinda).<br>12. I can *grin* and bear it.<br>13. XD<br>14. I'm in #Darkseas chat all the time.<br>15. I have zero life.<br>16. Ima drummer ma!<br>17. I'm usually willing to have a nice heart-to-heart screaming match in mIRC of AIM.<br>18. I'm a bottomless pit of useless information.<br>19. I can take insults like no other (and I'm getting ready for some right now, in response to this post...)<br>20. I can think of twenty reasons to elect me!<br><br>so. Thats it. Anything else I think of will be put up quick-like! <br><br><br><br>ps. vote for me! &nbsp;;D||
