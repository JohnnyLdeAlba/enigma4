It turned out that the wall was not a wall...it was...a round weasel &amp; his cousin Frank. The pogo stick said that melting clocks and lofty elephants painted by a man with a HUGE tasch were very 305-ish. Soon I discovered that it was Mandy who stole the inside out apple-cans. So thats how I saved the carrot teacher. ;) ;D :D :) 8)||

Thusly, I went to the kitchen to check to see if the weasels were still fresh, but instead found them in the freezer eating cows. Obviously, I was shocked to find that the cows were birds eating fruits, so I discovered that my brain was made of grapes. Still happy at this revelation, I wandered to the Dream Land and ate tea with Mrs. Bean and Mr. Rogers, where coincidently, it was a sunny day in the neighborhood. And thats when I discovered that I had a cow on. <br><br> :P *brain meltdown in 3...2...1........beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!*||

There is no do.&quot; &nbsp;So, I kept climbing until I reached the top of the beanstalk. &nbsp;There, I found the sword, and it said &quot;swim fastly past ten-arms,&quot; and I knew right then I had to float into the pool of jello, or else I would be doomed to a life of eating cheese and watching the radio while standing on my head.||

After discovering this I went backwards to the up-side-down, inside out clinic for cosmic peanut butter with rabies. One bit me reversed on an arm called Darry. Darry's death flashed before his eyes, he then melted and was turned into a beautiful swan. The swan then dropped dead.

Unfortunatly, his bed was a porcupine, and it resulted in a sudden sharp pain. In response to this, he leaped up, shot the wall, and flew through the fan. He found him self in the land of fruits, where vegetarians are sent to rot.<br>Suddenly the vegetarians started to eat his leg. When he calmly asked them why, they responded, &quot;Oh we are only faking it...duh!&quot;.

At that minute he decided to dance for the EVIL club, until his foot grew back, at which point he would live. Thats why you are full of doggy doo. Not to be confused with Scooby Doo, because Scooby is a dog that eats Scooby snax (which are in reality, hash brownies, but oh fudgepopper, this has already been eaten). You are not doggy doo, but you ARE full of doggy doo, which is almost like doggy poo, but not quite, because doggy doo is made of cornstarch and FLUGs.
