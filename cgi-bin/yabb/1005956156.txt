My third day of admin. and I get to ban someone!|yogoat|ze_third_mas@hotmail.com|11/16/01 at 17:15:56|yogoat|xx|0|24.6.207.243|And that person is YOU, kaxan...or D_12.  You'd think that you would be smart enough to actually change your ip, but you're still the dumbass we all know and hate.  Why don't you stop being such a low-life and make some friends, get laid, or possibly even get a job working at McDonalds?  I'm SURE one location would hire someone autistic...They can put you to greasing fries, right?<br><br>Also, all of your other nicknames (IE yang, yin, grey-fox, etc) will be deleted and banned, so don't even think about trying those.<br><br>With that said, I officially ban you!||11/16/01 at 19:32:59|yogoat
