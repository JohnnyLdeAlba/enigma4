Question about the noseball music from DC Ecco|Hesster|arklier@hotmail.com|10/08/01 at 01:52:38|Hesster|question|0|209.166.73.27|Greetings, just came here to ask a simple question. Before the game was released, IGN had a really cool movie file of Ecco playing noseball against a red dolphin, with this really cool music. It had a woman's voice singing:<br><br>Keep the secret<br>Keep the secret<br>You've got to keep the secret<br>You've got to keep the secret<br><br>And there the clip ends. I know the noseball &nbsp;made it into the game, but did the music? Does anyone recognize the music from anywhere else, cause I'd sure like to have a copy. I have the video clip on my hard drive, if anyone wants it.|||

I sure do hope you stay...as it sounds like you're definitely an Ecco fan too... :biggrin:<br><br>Anyway, yeah...that music in that &quot;Ecco plays noseball&quot; movie is frickin awesome! I'd forgotten about those there at IGN...thanks for the reminder Hesster... :wink: ...oh, and I almost think that beta version of the Soccer level is better than what they actually put in the game. I liked the looks of the arena better in the beta...wasn't as realistic as the one they used in the final version. The ball also looks way cooler! And did you catch that clan dolphin? I thought that he looked really cool too! Anyway...yea...!<br><br>Whitefin...that music on that archive is pretty cool isn't it! But, again...I think it's just beta music that ended up not getting used. I've not heard it before...so I don't know what it's called, or if it's out there to be had... :-/ ...oh well, at least you can view the movie with it...hehe!<br><br>Again, welcome to the board Hesster...and thanks for creating such a cool topic! Hope to see you around... ;)|||
