You've just done what I never had the time to do. XP<br><br>I applyed for a gallery there a LONG time ago, for my dragon art. But then I made my own site and decided to remain there instead of spreadin' my art all over the place. Three websites is enough, I couldn't keep up if I had my art on other sites as well....like The Vixen Controlled Library and Yerf. XD|||
