The Most Ridiculous Picture...|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/26/02 at 16:10:28|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Welp, as the thread title says, this is probably the most ridiculous picture I've ever drawn.<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/chronicle_keeper/chron_cast.jpg<br><br>(copy and paste into your browser because Gayocities is... well... gay)<br><br>I'll post the colored picture later, but for now I just thought you guys could use a laugh. This is the entire main cast of my Ecco fic. That dolphin being held up by the Asterite isn't Ecco, that's Eclipse. It looks like Ecco, though, don't it. And I wasn't entirely sure what the Guardian looked like (and I didn't feel like playing Ecco to figure it out) so I just kinda fluked it and gave him a big goofy smile.<br><br>Anyway I'll explain more later and post the colored version. Ciao for now.||

Re: The Most Ridiculous Picture...|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/26/02 at 20:09:20|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Thomas the Tank Engine? I'm insulted! LOL, just kidding! You're right, actually!<br><br>Well anyway, if you guys follow the link in my first message you can see it in color now, I just replaced it on Geocities so that the final version will come up. <br><br>So, the final roll call on this picture is Eclipse being the one held up by the Asterite, the Guardian and the New Vortex Queen (I'm especially fond of that look on her face, by the way &nbsp;;) ), the black dolphin on top of the Queen's head (and looking rightly peeved at the Guardian) is Sabian, the navy and black long nosed dolphin (a river dolphin) is Oriya, the purple one stickin' her tongue out at the clam is Demeter (she's young and prone to behavior like that), the red and black dude next to her is Cardinal, then Talyn, and finally the dolphin givin' the 'fins up' is Lunaris.<br><br>Well, have a laugh at it, if you like! It's meant to be a joke, really.<br><br>(PS- I cheated on the background and the Asterite's coloring, and I don't care. Color that entire background by hand? No freakin' way! I'm thanking PSP7 for its Flood Fill Pattern and Picture Tube effect right now!)||

Very funny! ;D||

Re: The Most Ridiculous Picture...|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/26/02 at 20:35:46|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.102.44|Cool, Delphi!  But, how come you're not in it?||
Re: The Most Ridiculous Picture...|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/26/02 at 20:49:58|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Thanks guys!<br><br>And let's see if I can explain this properly, Tethys... <br><br>Because the green dolphin in it, Talyn, that's who my face pic is based off of. It's... kinda stupid, really, but I didn't want to use Talyn's image for a face pic when my name is Delphi. So, I used a less complicated version of Talyn to make my face pic (just dropped the stripe and pink belly, really) and called that Delphi's image. I should really have made it a bit different, but I didn't, and that's kinda just the way it is. Technically, I'm half in it. <br><br>So are we confused yet, children? ;)||
