confused (as usual)|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|02/03/02 at 19:55:58|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.172|I actually realised this a while ago but everday since Wednesday until now I've had a different reason each day why I couldn't log on.<br><br>Anyway, the thing I realised is that when I was talking about the new Tethys I said something about seven gaurdians for each of the seven oceans. &nbsp;The reason I said seven is because I was thinking of the thing you always hear about the &quot;seven seas.&quot; &nbsp;But I can only think of four oceans, so I'm pretty sure there are only four. &nbsp;That was a really stupid mistake on my part.<br><br>But the thing that has me confused is this &quot;seven seas&quot; thing. &nbsp;I never thought about it before, but for some reason I always assumed it reffered to the oceans until I realised I could only name four and it's unlikely that there's seven (hey I never said I was smart). &nbsp;So then I thought it must refer to actual seas (you know, like the Carribean and the Caspian) tho for some reason an ocean is often referred to as &quot;the sea&quot;. &nbsp;But then when I tried to think of all of the seas that I know for certain, I realized there are more than seven. &nbsp;And this resulted in confusion. &nbsp;I used to think I knew what people meant when they said &quot;the seven seas&quot; but now I'm not so sure anymore.<br><br>And if there really are seven oceans and I just can't think of all of them and so therefore figure there must only be four, then I'm a moron and you can just ignore me because I obviously don't know what the hell I'm talking about.||

There are countless numbers of these, many more than seven.<br><br>||
