Re: Bushfires in Aus|Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/06/02 at 14:40:56|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.26.78|*hugs Trellia bacK* Mew, very scary indeed. When they had the news on this morning, there was a woman whom had a poor little baby possum in her hands that had lost its mother in the fires *whimpers*. The thing that worrys me the most is my poor Aunty Maggie - she lives up in the Blue Mountains, and on Christmas Day was able to see the flames near her. She almost lost Lifeline (the store she owns) and she has been told to be ready to evacuate 2 times. <br><br>Yeah, but I really hope that they can control it *shudders* 40 odd meter tall walls of flame that spit embers the size of your fist 100 or 200m away and starting another fire... ||
