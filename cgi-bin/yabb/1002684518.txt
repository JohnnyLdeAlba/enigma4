His name was Delat and his story has become a legend that survived many years through a time of peace. <br><br>But dark forces formed withen and this time it wasnt the vortex. It was a clan of orcas bent on destroying the intire dolphin population. There mission was to create a world ruled by orca kind. There leader was a svoir who wasnt born yet but if the settings where right would create a world only orca kind would know...<br><br>The prediction was that the leader of this future would be killed by a dolphin savoir! - the savoir of the future!<br><br>to make sure this didn't happen the dark whale clan formed...7 dark whales bent on ensuring there leader who hasn't been born yet lives to rule forever!<br><br>the leader of the dark whale clan was Thorax and his mission was to ensure that Apacalypes would be born and live to create a world of orca rule!<br><br>the dark wahle clan would devistate pods of dolphins and kill them off in an instant...but things got worse as they began to search out there own kind..begining with a young orca named clondike who was raised all his life by a sea tortuse by the name of torrello...<br><br>One day they stumbled upon unknown parts...it could have been atlantis if atlantis wasnt thousands of miles away<br><br>This was a sunken city of man called tantalus...clondike hid himself deep withen this citys ruins hidden in a chamber. Torrello stood by him frieghtened they would get into more danger being somewhere they don't know...<br><br>A nosie of cracking stone was heard and both Clondike and Torrello look to find a small crab climbing an erie stone staue...afraid they would be heard clondike let out a sonar that lit the room up...then something responded back...clondikes sonar reflected off of a cyrstal glyph which eccod back something different...a different screech but none the less it was something...<br><br>The small crab climbed up a small pillar which served as a base to what seemed to spread out like branches on a tree...there was another one of these strange sculptures which sat next to the one the crab climbed...it was two human like hand scuptures...and as the crab climbed over them they bagan to move!<br><br>the hands caused the crab to fling into the air...Torrello clinged onto Clondike for deer fright that the dark iorcas would find them and out of there surprised the hands formed like rolling up a clay ball a sphere of light which levetated up above the pamls to the finger tips and flew up then exploded leavig intact the strange scupture device and a dolphin...the dolphin bore five stars upon his head...clondike looked...could this be Delat the Dolphin? yes it was!!! he was back!<br><br>please continue the story...<br><br>[/glow]<br>Then came a man France<br>Whos balls were made fo fine brass <br>And one stormy weather they all clanked together<br>And sparks came out of his ass<br>**********************************************<br>Then came delta and killed all the bad gays, in the prosses even some of the good guys. He came home and all was well <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OR WAS IT.||11/05/01 at 21:26:16|Delta

The marks on his head glowed lighting the room and electricity flickred on and off around the dolphin who soon opens his eyes and see's the world to which he has returned..<br><br>Clondike and Terrello were shocked to see ecco return after so long of his dissapearance.<br>Ecco stood vertical upwards as if he was standing, then hsi body lowered to see clondike and torrelo in amazement.<br><br>The young curious whale circle ecco, looking and gazingupon him.<br><br>&quot;..Ecco?&quot; the whale said silently to himself as he studied the dolphin.<br>&quot;Yes, it is! You're ecco the dolphin! The one who rides the tides of time and hero of atlantis, destroyer of darkness!&quot; Clondike was over joyed, swimming around ecco faster and faster with hsi exitement.<br>&quot;Torrello has told me stories about you, and you're back! Then maybe you were destined to be the hero of the sea.&quot;<br>The small whale slowed to a pause..&quot;The you can help fort off the dark whales! They've come for me. We need your help, will you help me tides rider?&quot;<br><br>[color=Teal]....[/color]<br><br>&quot;Then come this way!&quot;<br><br>The whale lets Torrelo get onto his back as him, Cloondike and Ecco swim to the entrance to where they came.<br><br>Outside...<br>The 7 whales charge at the door, which begins to slowly crack open with every blow. They stop for a minute as one whale swims to the middle staring at the door..<br><br>&quot;We will insure the safty of our leader's youth! Now, let the doors open!!&quot;<br><br>The whale, bearing a red eye with 3 yellow pupils resembling scratches  on his opened his mouth showing a long pointed toungue, as his mouth oepend, hsi eyes widened and then the sea began to tremmble...<br><br>*LYZKAZZAAAAAHHHHH-A-PAC!!!&quot; His eyes flashes, and suddenly the front of the main entrance of the central tantulus building broke exploded opened...<br>[/glow]<br><br>Continue from here...||10/09/01 at 23:33:49|Tass_Dawg
