You have no choice its a way to keep your jobs.<br><br>Your first assignment is to find a relly old topic post in it and lock it.<br><br>I want you whitefin and histronic to do that.<br><br>let me start laying out the rules for being a mod.<br>1. Never delete topics unless there new, or talk shit about arkon =)<br>2. Lock topics if they are off subject or if they were relly old and were brought up and you see no point in an old descussion returning.<br><br>Anyhow thats all im gonna explain for now go do your assignments.||
