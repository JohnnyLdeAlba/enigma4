Without loosing speed the creature grabed the sharks neck, twisted it backward and killed it (poor sharky :() It became more angry and swam forward and grabbed me again. I turned around and rammed my snout into it as hard as i could. He began to scream that alien scream loudly, but this time it sounded different. sort of like a call.
