My friend downloaded it on my computer cause she needed to use it on my computer real quick, and then the idea was I would just delet it. But you see...I can't delete it! It isn't in the add/remove programs and I can't even get rid of it through MSN or anything.<br>Does anyone know how, cause it's becoming a pain in the butt. ||

I'll look around next time im logged into the MSDN stuff.<br><br>Note: I presume you've tried this<br>[url]http://messenger.msn.com/support/helphome.asp?client=2#Q2[/url]||01/25/02 at 12:39:57|Shadow
Re: Damn MSN! @_@|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/25/02 at 16:32:11|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.124.236|You can always download an uninstaller program. I have McAffee Uninstaller. I'm pretty sure you have to buy it, but if you look on KaZaA or whatever. Try looking on Google or any other search engine. Just look for &quot;McAfee Uninstaller&quot; or just plain &quot;Uninstaller.&quot; Those prgrams usually get rid of bitchy programs that cling to your hard drive and make themselves invisible so you can't delete them.||
Re: Damn MSN! @_@|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/25/02 at 18:51:58|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|Thanks Shadow. I went to that help page and it says delete the MSN folder...but I can't find anyfolder. I've looked all over this damn computer. And see, even Arkon can't get rid of it...and Arkon I'm sure can figure how to turn on his computer unlike me.  :P But for now I do keep it signed out. It's still their though, and I keep getting messages saying &quot;blah blah&quot; had added you to his/her contact list...oh well. I'm stuck now!<br><br>Oh yeah...and thanks Kitnee! But I've already got an uninstaller guy, but it can't find the msn thing. &nbsp;:P||01/25/02 at 18:58:09|Doomtrain

Ok I just found the damn thing, but when I say delete it, it says:<br>&quot;Cannot delete msnsgs: It is being used by another person or program.&quot;<br>Everything is closed, and it wont delet. Help anyone?||
Re: Damn MSN! @_@|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/25/02 at 20:05:39|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.124.236|OK, Doom, lesse...<br><br>First go into Windows Explorer. &nbsp;Then go into the hard drive that you installed the bugger in (most likely it was your C drive). &nbsp;Select the folder &quot;Program Files&quot; and look for the subfolder called &quot;Messenger.&quot; Click on it once - don't open it. Then hit the delete key; it [i]should[/i] ask you if you wanna delete the folder and all of its contents, so say &quot;Yes.&quot; The next message that should come up will say something about &quot;The file msnsgs.exe is a program; if you delete it you won't be able to use it again.&quot; Just hit &quot;OK.&quot; Hopefully, it will delete. If not, then I'll try to think of a way around it, unless Shadow or Arky beat me to it. :P||
Re: Damn MSN! @_@|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/26/02 at 20:03:30|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|Doom, You might need to use the task manager (ctrl-alt-delete) to shut down the messenger process, before you can delete it.||
Re: Damn MSN! @_@|Kitnee|Kitnee@hotmail.com|01/26/02 at 20:29:15|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.86.242|Yes, try that, too, Doom. The only that's a little &quot;eh&quot; about my method is that when you do a hard delete like that, you leave behind all sorts of old and orphaned registry entries, which may or may not affect you in any way. It depends on just how crappy MSN Messenger is. :P &nbsp;I have this Quick Clean program from McAffee that cleans out old registry entries and stuff. Not sayin' that you definately need it or anything, but...also, there is a spiffy program created by Microsoft called Registry Cleaner. Just run it and it takes away all bad registry entries. ^_^ You might try downloading that just to make sure that your registry decides to hate you after you delete the Messenger.||
