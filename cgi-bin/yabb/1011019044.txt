I used a photo reference of a real cat and threw the desired hair-do on top...i think it loox rather cheesyt dun you? like she wearing a damn wig.<br><br>[img]http://www.arkonviox.com/user/vantid/cat.jpg[/img]<br><br>oh well. what do you think? ive got more, just none scanned....especially a certain black, bat-winged fox.||

Ill either keep it cuz i love it so, auction it at furbid for a measly 25 to 30 dollars, or give it to the sheltie club for a raffle. if i give it to the club, i could build my rep as an artist and possibly get commisions. Furbid is iffy cuz i dun wanna sell it for so low...and keeping it...well, i like it but what good does it do me to have it on MY wall?<br><br>anyway, i forgot to add Awas....for those of you who have read my story Etain, you know who he is. for those that havent...hes a half-mammal, half-reptile demon. a real sweety yep. hes so drooly.<br><br>[img]http://arkonviox.com/user/vantid/awas[/img]<br><br>and an update on the wuf, which i worked on last night.<br><br>[img]http://arkonviox.com/user/vantid/wuf2.jpg[/img]<br><br>its kinda big. oops.||

And your stuff is real high end stuff. ^_^<br><br>It used to take me up to three weeks to do a large painting. Nowadays I can pull off a 16"x20" in a week if I'm really into it. The Ecco pic' I did for the art contest I finnished in  7 hours...but I did lots of preliminary sketches before any paint hit canvas.||

I dunno what it is, but I never had that problem before.  I didn't even see that one other thing before, as it must have also disappeared then, and now I only saw the top part because the rest disappeared.  I have to reboot the computer before I can actually come back and see those images again. But I'm not going to do that now.||
