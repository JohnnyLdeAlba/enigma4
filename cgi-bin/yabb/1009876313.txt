Happy New Year!!!<br><br>This past year sure has been...well...a year to be put away with the past. I wasn't able to accomplish much...but sure did learn a whole lot. I've experienced things I never thought I'd have to. Amidst the incredible misfortune my family and I had to endeavor, good things came about...or rather...blessings were that much more easier to see. For, one of my siblings and I both had near death experiences...but survived. Anyway, I met a person this year who's been an incredible friend...and will be for the rest of my life...while my existing friendships have only grown stronger. The quest to figure out what to do with my life...still hasn't brought many answers...so perhaps that will come in this next year. So, good bye to the year 2001...hello 2002! Goals? Well, I don't believe in setting them. That way you're sure to never let yourself down... ;)||01/01/02 at 18:57:18|dolphingirl
