I planned this to be a big contest and even though we have recieved more entries then the undercaves in it's hay day, i want to double what i have and work on what the prize will be...<br><br>first i have a question what do you think the prize should be? money? an old assed playstation with some sucky game? a brand spankin new copy of Ecco, Defender of the Future for PS2?<br><br>Ha ha ha i want your opinions and if you think it should be extended? thanks...<br><br>~Arkonviox||

Funny thing is they been popping up unexpectedly and the contest has been doing pretty good. So much good art work ^_^ thats for sure.<br><br>I think it might depend on the winner....we'll see||
