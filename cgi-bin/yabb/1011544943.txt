Things that aren't stupid enough to delete!|Histronic|john__cool@hotmail.com|01/20/02 at 09:42:21|Histronic|xx|0|209.242.238.43|Well crestoes opening speech covered a lot of important restrictions, but i oftentimes have trouble dealing with the fact that people are less smart/more sentimental/are more easily contented by wasting time than me.  Now if i went out and did what i planned, i'd napalm half the off topic forum and send a good deal of our population packing to Sonic HQ.  Now the restrictions on forum games....  Should they be locked when they get so fucking redundant that we cant handle it anymore?  If i think an idea is gay from the start can i just delete the topic?  After this i think all questions of mine will be answered... unless of course your answer confuses me and i have more questions!||

Idiots will be mad cuz they lost their post counts, yes its pathetic.<br><br>2. By deleting posts, you deliver and unfriendly opening to newer or current members, which isnt always a good thing, if not, never.<br><br>But tell me which one syer thinking about and i'll look into it. Just tell me about topics that piss you off, but remmember, you cant saticefy yer own needs all the time.||
