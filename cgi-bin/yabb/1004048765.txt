Re: So what is the best game?|GTK|gtkelpie@hotmail.com|11/01/01 at 12:39:08|GTK|xx|0|193.61.213.130|I'm gonna be weird here and say &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot;. See, this is one of the things I've been thinking about recently regarding Sega games. The later games tend to drift away from the original concept. <br><br>Look at Sonic the Hedgehog, the first game was all about bombing through the level as fast as you could go. By the time we got to S3&amp;K we were spending most of our time looking for the way out. And Sonic Adventure was practically an action-RPG. Admittedly in SA2 Sega went back to the original concept, at least for the Sonic and Shadow stages (anyone who thinks that Green Forest or White Jungle isn't about &quot;bombing through the level as fast as you could go&quot; obviously hasn't played either. Hedgie go boom). <br><br>But anyway--I digress. The original Ecco was all about exploring and solving puzzles in a mystical undersea environment. ToT developed the graphics and made everything move more fluidly, but I personally don't think there were many other changes. As for DotF... People won't agree with me on this, but I feel that Ecco, like many oldschool games, lost something when it went 3D. I used to spend hours in the old games making the little 2D Ecco jump about, and while I do that on occasion in DotF, I just don't enjoy it as much. <br><br>In fact, if you look at other games that have made the transition from 2D to 3D, you can see it. IMHO, the only ones that really work both ways are Super Mario 64 and Zelda 64, and only because Nintendo do damn good camera A-life. <br><br><br>Okay, I've gone way off-topic here, but I wanted to explain exactly why I chose the game that was a decade old rather than the swanky rendered immersive environment that is Ecco's latest iteration. |||
Re: So what is the best game?|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/01/01 at 19:46:00|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.104.58|I tend to agree with GTK. DotF doesn't even have glyphs, and there is no Vortex. &nbsp;I don't know about the Asterite since I never got far, but I'm sure he's gone too. &nbsp;And the controls are confusing--pressing up to go down and vice versa, I keep messing up in that way, and I keep pressing the wrong button.<br><br>And btw, *I* am the biggest procastinator in the world! And I too have an old Genesis (which only works when it wants too) along with both the original game and ToT. &nbsp;But that's at my cottage, and we rarely go there during the winter.|||

The Vortex has been replaced with the Foe! The controls are based on flight controls, as you get to move in all directions!!! I actually think the game is MUCH better with up/down reversed.

I'm sure that's all it is. DotF wouldn't have worked any other way that what they've already set the controls up to be. On the other hand, I suppose they could've put a &quot;configure controls&quot; option in the game, for the &quot;backwards&quot; people...heheh! Nah, but really, the controls in the game are incredibly realistic if ya ask me! And I find it helluva lot more enjoyable to swim around with Ecco in DotF than in the older ones...look at the many tricks/flips you can do!!!

And those aren't glyphs, there...well I guess the instruction manuel calls them &quot;information shards,&quot; and they are peices of the Gaurdian. So it's not the same thing. &nbsp;And I really don't see how it makes any sense that pressing up should go down. &nbsp;I realize I could probably get used to that. |||
