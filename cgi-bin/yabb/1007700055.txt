I've gotten a few calls from her--well, actually from a recording of her voice. &nbsp;It's like &quot;Hello, this is Miss Cleo--&quot; *click!* &nbsp;<br><br>Well it was still pretty funny even tho I'm slightly dissappointed that Miss Cleo won the battle.||

Ah, and because of the overwhelming response to this, I'll be making an Episode 2! YES!<br><br>Tune in next time for:<br><br>Justice is not only blind, but bisexual.<br><br>or<br><br>Thats not a lawyer! Thats my fat-free dairy imitation product...<br><br>Yes, really. Also, if this actually picks up (O.o;;;), I'll be lookin for someplace to host them seperatly, so as not to clog up arkons ftp and forum. =) Any ideas?<br><br>||
