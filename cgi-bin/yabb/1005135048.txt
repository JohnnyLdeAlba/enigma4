SEX SEX AND MORE SEX!!!|asteritius|asteritius@hotmail.com|11/07/01 at 05:10:47|asteritius|xx|0|217.216.121.33|<br>Well , now i´m sure i have your ATENTION ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D<br><br>Last week i have been out and now i was thinking about why we lOVE this game...<br>We all have seen many ,many games with hundreds of options, weapons, characters , horrible monsters , evil foes , heroism ... compared to them , Ecco seem to be a poor game and even simple...because Ecco is a very DIFFERENT game.Why? Because it has THREE things LINKED together:<br><br>1) GREAT STORYLINE<br>2)AWESOME MUSIC<br>3)INCREDIBLE GRAPHICS<br><br>And they are linked in order to create a very special ATMOSPHERE. I´m sure all of you had an almost &quot;magical&quot; moment of time playing it , a situation you think you´ll always remember , something that you won´t find in another game and make you think .<br>One of my favourites was just before entering Atlantis at the end of &quot;Roaring Forces&quot; when you touch that thing...when you get there the music change ,all seem to be special in that place.<br>I hope the next Ecco will be better in this, creating many of this places and situations.<br><br>HEY , whe you saw this topic´s title...What were you thinking about? ;D ;D|||

That part of the game was really mysterious, and I liked it a LOT. That, and going to the different times made me feel like I was oddly 'in' the situation. I'm sure you've all felt it.<br><br>I was in awe of the story for Tides of Time, though. I mean, it's simple, sorta, but I felt really special when I beat that game. Yeh heh. &nbsp;;D|||

Re: SEX SEX AND MORE SEX!!!|yogoat|ze_third_mas@hotmail.com|11/08/01 at 18:53:43|yogoat|xx|0|24.6.207.243|My favorite place?  Hmm...let me think...Oh yeah, my definite favorite time in Ecco is where you go through those rings in Atlantis and skyrocket through the air to get that last crystal.  I had fun with those rings for hours on end!  Just going straight up and into nowhere and...ah, it was great.<br><br>But I would MUCH rather turn into a devil, jump on the air, fly and shoot lightning bolts at an incredibly sized bird that likes to shoot electricity balls at me with techno music (much like Rammstein) playing loudly in the background.||11/08/01 at 19:01:00|yogoat

Re: SEX SEX AND MORE SEX!!!|Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|11/08/01 at 22:24:10|Whitefin|xx|0|61.9.151.244|My favorite place it Atlantis in ToT and Ecco 1 (Deep City) and City of Forever. I don't know why, but there is an eerie peacefullness around them *well - I can feel it NE ways when I play* ^_^ I'm one that when I play, I pretend i'm the main character, and I try to think and feel the way they do. Try it one time, set your mind into the one your playing and it makes the experience worthwhile ^_^|||

Re: SEX SEX AND MORE SEX!!!|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/09/01 at 21:06:47|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.106.36|I love Antlantis, just because the scenerey is very beautiful. I also like in Ecco ToT when you change into a bird and fly around--I would often fly back and forth and an loops and stuff just for fun. &nbsp;Almost as fun as jumoing around and doing tricks in the water. &nbsp;And I loved the time travel sequence, particularly the first time with the time machine. &nbsp;I actually found it somewhat mesmorizing with the music and the swirling stars. &nbsp;I love the music. I remember the first time I got to that part, I was like &quot;Woah! Cool!&quot;|||

They oughta keep that in the next Ecco, but a little longer and maybe a little more colorful. You should know that not all stars are white, they can verify in many colors: red, orange, yellow, and blue. Also add a few nebulas here and there, if you ever watched Titan A.E. and notice the background it's gorgeous, all the colors and shapes and the... *notices everyone falling asleep*<br><br>0.o Er, I'll shut up now.|||
