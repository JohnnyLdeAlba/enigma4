You have a short amount of time, so i'll be honest:<br><br>I dont want you here, i dislike you...its yer personality. It sickens me. I just hear yer name and shudder the thought of a fool who uses the excuses of family memebers to try and get back and each time i do, i somehow feel ive been infect with yer idiocy.<br><br>So rather then saying hi again, i suggest you start making a goodbye post...NOW!!!<br><br>And dont bother coming back. I'll keep banning you and banning you until i must take drastic actions. And you WONT like that.||12/27/01 at 16:19:22|Crestoe
