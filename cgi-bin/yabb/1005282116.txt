Keep yer chin up tough guy...you can do it...and don't worry about your site! You've built it up so good it can survive for quite a while on it's own. Sure as hell won't be the same...but you know everyone here won't give up. Anyway, talk to you soon hopefully man...[i]*gives you a tight squeeze*[/i]...seeya!||
