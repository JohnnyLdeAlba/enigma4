I take great pride in the furry characters of New Generation earth.... especially since i studied anatomy and anime/american styles.  i guess my study time would have been better spent writing homophobic/art hate sites...<br>Now if furries are the cause of homosexuality, i guess artists are the big fags right?  i'll be the big fag kicking this persons ass if i ever find out if he lives near me!<br><br>Not to mention i now recognize what kind of person makes this.  Not a real christian, but a Fundamentalist.  These people are pseudo white trash, but disguise it by acting better than everyone.  If you havent noticed, these people are anti gay, think jew were the ones who killed people in world war 2, and most disturbingly of all, are anti feminist.  These are the people who believe the womens only purpose is to wait on men.... if everyone thought this was a good idea, we wouldn't have vantids artwork, or a lot of chemistry theories and shit.... no this is definitely fucked up.<br><br>Now if that doesnt make you think fundamentalists are fucked up, check out what passes for humor with these nutcases:<br><br>##############################<br><b>Image removed by:</b> Arkonviox<br><b>Reason:</b> Had a penis in it =(<br><b>Suggestion:</b> Instead of penises have <br>wemen boobs =)<br>##############################<br><br>Yes.  Sigh, bang head on keyboard, repeat.  And there are some there i just dont want to look at ever again.  Not to mention the Sabrina Online parody was way outta line as that was always one of my favorite humor comics.  -_- i dont know why, but the creator of this site and psysonic would make a good couple.<br><br>On another note, if you explore the site enough and are good at decoding spelling errors, you can be lucky enough to find clever phrases like "remember when the jews killed all those people in world war 2?" or "Monty Python is evil.  It was a python that tempted adam and eve in the garden."  And one of my personal favorites: "Microsoft is not a monopoly.  Microsoft is a good company because they gave me Frontpage express"  Just when you think he hit bottom, someone throws him a shovel.  Also, you can get cool things like "These peopel are like mafia guys or drug dealers, or worse, GAYS!!!!11111  , or worse!  I seriously wonder if this is a joke now, because as i write this, i am a quivering pile of mass, knowing that craziness ranges far and wide in the world.  When i finish new Generation earth, I will send it to this guy.  Not only does it violate most of the ten commandments, but there is nothing gay about it so he'll probably start a new hate page.  And he will parody me, probably in the scenes where gizo gets drunk and hits on a female soldier in his army (female soldiers are feminist) or when and histronic break the dam to destroy the advancing army (individual thinking)  Or perhaps the fact that histronic only wears pants and a vest, not a shirt (furry porno)  Smeone kill me.||01/20/02 at 17:37:21|Histronic

I figure a fan site is like worship...a tribute to the person who birthed your favorite character.  No ecco site dosen't scream "THANKKKK YOUUUUUU SEGAA PEOPLEZZZZZ!!!"||

I do have one thing to say about "furries" though...I mean...the furry art I've seen people here in this community do...is cool. But, when it gets to a sexual nature...that's when it starts to get a lil freaky if ya ask me. Some may not think so...and if you're one of 'em...shut the hell up...cause it's just my opinion. Rip on me all you want...but I ain't changin it. What really goes too far...is when those people put those furry suits on...and have sex in 'em. I saw an interesting program on MTV the other week, where a whole new door was opened up to this...so called "furry" world...and to put it mildly...it was...hahaha...funny but yet slightly disturbing. I can see someone loving animals...but to go to the extremes of dressing up like them, and having sex while in the frickin suits...well now...that's a bit strange. But hey, whatever floats yer boat, as the saying goes...that kinda stuff isn't for me though. I'd much rather stay with the human sexuality, rather than the mixed-animal kind. And like I said...the kinda stuff you guys on this site draw...that stuff's cool...it's just the other stuff I think is..."out there". If any of what I said here offends you...sorry...but that's just my opinion. And, if you can't get over it...it's yer fault. I wonder what someone as logical as goat would have to say about this...hmmm...||

Or something like that.<br><br><br>dolphingirl, I gotta say from first hand experince, alot of the "furry fandom" breaks down into two major parts; The artists, most of whom arn't very good, who do large runs of what I consider to be not much more than pseudo-bestial homosexual pornography, which they sell to the other part of the fandom, the fanboys for some highly inflated price of $50 to $75.<br><br>As long at theres people that are willing to travel cross country to spend $2000 on poor quality porn cartoons, this unfortunatly will exist.<br><br>Sucks, but thats the way it is.<br><br><br>||

Seems almost like performance art to me...but at least it's not gay bestiality...or at least I hope it hasn't gotten to that point yet.  I suppose some things just turn other people on more than other things, but it's always better than doing it with actual ANIMALS, you know?  now THAT would be something that's extremely wrong in every way...but I won't get into that.  Hell, I don't know why I'm commenting on this, maybe to bring a little yogoat-logic into it...*'phil's his bong and takes a drag* Now then...how real were the costumes?  Because I, personally, am thinking about Pluto doing it with Mickey Mouse or something...hahahah, that'd be way too funny for me to give a damn about this whole animal-costume-sex thing.  I think it should be laughed at rather than taken SO seriously, I mean, it's not really hurting anyone (I hope), and no one's really to say if it's god awful or the best thing since pot. *fills his bong again* If you don't appreciate it and hope whoever created it was shot in all of his toes, then think that way; it's just humans being, well, humans...or animals, in this case. ;)  Well, I lost what I was saying about twenty sentences ago, so it's time to hit the post button once again.||
