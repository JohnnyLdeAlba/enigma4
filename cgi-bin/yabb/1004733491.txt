Nothing much important to YOU but...|vantid|vantid@arkonviox.com|11/02/01 at 13:38:11|vantid|xx|0|207.80.104.200|Oh so very important to ME!!!! i emailed a professional artist a few days ago, and he emailed me back! eee! you can see his site here... http://www.rodlawrence.com/ and see how good he is. this is what he wrote...<br><br>Dear Amber:<br><br>I enjoyed your letter and the kind compliments about my book and my work. I do have to correct you on the statement you made in the first paragraph. You do not lack the talent for painting - you lack the experience! Your work shows you are very talented and to apply that into another medium just takes time, practice (experience), time, practice, time, - you get the drift?<br><br>Wow. You encountered a cougar up-close and personal. Sounds like you were lucky and I don’t mean just by seeing it. They can be dangerous and especially over a kill.<br><br>The CA workshop must have been wonderful. I actually started my art career painting the west, including cowboys, Indians, etc. I moved to Montana for nearly five years and painted there for shows and galleries. So I have been a follower of many western artists. One of my favorites that I got to meet way back when, is James Bama. We still correspond once in a great while. I have not met Ken Carlson, but had the dubious honor of having him beat me in a National Wild Turkey Federation contest in 1979. He won and I got second.<br><br>By the way, Ice Palace is one of my favorite paintings as well. The original belongs to my parents and hangs over their fireplace mantel.<br><br>Good luck to you with your work - keep painting!<br><br>Best regards - Rod<br><br>Yes, my real name is amber. :dolphin7: |||
