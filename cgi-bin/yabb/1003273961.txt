After all, Sega scrapped their hardware enterprise when it went software only. Ecco DoF is cheaper now also, I've seen it being sold for 40 bucks Canadian! (WAY cheap in american dollars, about twenty bucks!). I plan on buying another copy, just in case the one I have gets a lethal scratch or something (god forbid). <br><br>One more thing, I think that DoF has good replay value. I still play it often, even tho' I beat it ages ago. Replay value is a hard thing to find in DC games, and Ecco's got plenty...in my opionion anyway. &nbsp;;D|||
