Yes, it's furry art, but I'm planning on using the same base of making skelital structures on dolphins now. ^_^|||

The creature is standing facing light and the light is reflecting off of the metal parts like the earrings and necklace. They are both great peices of art. Great Work it's awesome|||

Re: My best piece of 2001|GTK|gtkelpie@hotmail.com|10/27/01 at 01:19:31|GTK|xx|0|193.61.213.131|It's very nice ^^ The only thing I'd say is that her breasts are kind of weird. Breasts aren't balloons, they sorta slope outwards then point slightly... *thinks* There are a lot of anime artists out there who do breasts very well and jdillon's tutorial on howtodrawmanga.com is useful in that respect. It's not at all bad, though--it's a very good drawing. <br><br>Not that I go round the Net looking at pictures of breasts, oh no...<br><br>*slopes off* |||
