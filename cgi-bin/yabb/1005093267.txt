I came here to put up a li'l tune I composed, and I put it up because it's Ecco related! Well, er... sorta... but anyways! The song is the theme for my fic dolphin, Talyn. Since I don't have a scanner (as of yet, that is...) I can't show her to you all, but I can let you listen to her song, which kinda catches her personality (if I'm ANY kind of composer, that is). So... to listen to it you need winamp, some tolerance for my shitty composing skills, and an open ear! <br><br>http://www.geocities.com/wicked_talyn/Chime_of_Tundra.mid<br><br><br>Lemme know whatcha think!||11/06/01 at 17:34:51|Delphi

Re: Opinions?|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|11/06/01 at 20:41:14|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.223.143|Thanks, Swift Current!<br><br>Anyone who cares to critique it can, too, I s'pose. I mean, my composing style, I've noticed, seems to be repetitive. I have one main theme in the background, then I add a few more instruments, then those instruments end and so does the main part, and then I'm left with a little tiny tune at the end.<br><br>Erm, whatever!<br><br>But uh... I kinda wanted to ask if anyone maybe wanted a theme song done for their character, too? I mean, God knows I'm no Trace Kyshad (those who remember him will know what I mean), but I can try. Lemme know what you think. I'd be happy to do someone a song, because the composing really helps me with my band class marks and stuff!|||

He's a strong, young dolphin with a strong zest for life...<br><br>Reply if you can make it  :)||11/07/01 at 11:01:47|FargalEX
Re: Opinions?|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|11/07/01 at 16:36:36|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.223.143|Sorry, Monark (ark, whatever...). It's just that since people have been posting info about their fanfics/pics/characters in this area, well... that'd be why I posted this here. <br><br>And Mutaclone's theme, hmm? I could try, but you have to tell me which version of it you want (referring to your Real Audio files, that is). The thing is, if it's really wacky and weird I dunno if I could do it. I was originally just gonna do 4 Ways of Mystery from DotF... but hey, variety is the spice of life... :)<br><br>FargalEX: Yes, I'd be happy to give a Sareth theme song a shot! I'll get working on it as soon as I get some spare time (and I get a LOT of it...). <br><br>Yay. I'm finally able to do something for you guys. Everyone's been drawing each other pictures and stuff, and without a scanner... well... I can't do that, so I'll do songs instead! (Disclaimer: I'm not really that GOOD, though...)|||

I managed to catch you in chat...hopefully you'll remember my comments I made there... ;) ...keep up the good work! Cant wait to hear more from ya!<br><br>Oh and Arkon...I promised ya that midi a long time ago...sorry it's taken me so long...I have it all worked out...it's just when I can figure out just how do compose a midi...it's yours baby!

I like this one more then your other one, but it was cool too, if not a bit harsh on my soundcard (think WHAM, heh). But this one I like...it even rumbles by speakers with the bass! heheh.<br><br>Oh hey, speaking of which, remember that composing program that you &quot;prescribed&quot; to me? How, how, how, HOW do you get the percussion to work? I wanna make a cadence!!! whaaaaaa!<br><br><br><br>*winks* FLUG!|||
Re: Opinions?|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|11/08/01 at 21:09:05|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.223.143|Hmm... I'm not too sure on that one myself, Alastor. You'll notice that the songs I do rarely use percussion ('cept Sareth's song, which is currently about 25% done). Since that damn program only gives you about three different types of drum to use, it's kinda gay...<br><br>I know that if you start the program up and then hit 'New', you can choose a tab from the menu that'll pop up called 'Rhythm', and those rhythms are premade drum parts... but as to how to make 'em, I dunno, just choose a drum and compose the beats as you want them? Sorry I can't be of more help, guy.<br><br>On a sidenote, when you figure out how to make these parts, do you think you could make a couple for me to use in my songs? I'm no good at drum parts myself... |||
