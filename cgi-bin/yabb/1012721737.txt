Advice on a different story?|K|kschnee@mit.edu|02/03/02 at 00:35:36|K|xx|0|209.247.244.251|:book: I'm working on a new story called "Blue Prophet." It's about half done, and I could use advice -- especially on good places to have less dialogue / more exposition, and on the balance of action vs. thinking. Those, and: do you have any idea what's going on? This is actually the sequel to the one I finished, so I don't know if it contains everything you need to know to understand it so far.<br><br>Anyone want to take a look at it? It's here:<br>http://web.mit.edu/kschnee/www/Blue%20Prophet.rtf<br><br>Thanks if you have any suggestions!||02/03/02 at 19:18:56|Arkonviox

Programs like WordPad have a &quot;wrap text to window&quot; or &quot;word wrap&quot; option. I tried reformatting it to TXT but that didn't help.<br><br>Lately I've gotten into outlining everything before writing. Do other people do that? Before I started that, I tended to begin with a neat idea, and have no idea where to go with it.||
