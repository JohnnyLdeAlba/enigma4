Ecco DotF Glitches|Lord Morpheus|Morpheus247@myrealbox.com|10/10/01 at 20:06:47|Lord_Morpheus|xx|0|170.215.28.191|Well, I have played Ecco DotF alot. And I have found a few glitches where you can swim outside of the game world. The first one everyone knows about. It is in the Blades in Motion level with the boss. The second was in the waterway generator. It was at the part where you can speak to the whales that power the generator Powers of Levitation. I was up against the glass playing around trying to get threw. And I did! I don't know how I did. I just kept charging it up close. Well nothing really speciall happend. You could swim threw the wales but no the walls. I don't remember if you could swim back threw the glass or not. I think I did or I drowned. The third was in the Hatchery. I remember going outside of the walls near the air in the fish tank. I remember that you can see threw the walls from the outside. You can also go threw the texture stuff that you see out the windows. I think the texture only covered where you could see out the window. On the sides where there was no window it was just blue. I remember I never could get back into the main area of the hatchery, so I drowned. So has anyone else found one I missed?|||

Also, because of a glitch I managed to defeat the boss after escaping from the resistance base (the boss that looks like a big crocodile). Well, anyway, I used my sonar to knock down the spikes off of the ceiling and on top of the thing but I missed and they were all stuck in the floor, meaning it was impossible to defeat the boss. So I swam through the spikes in the floor and the thing chased me, but somehow it went under the floor and got hurt so I defeated it. Hurrah!|||
