I WAS NOT GONE!|asteritius|asteritius@hotmail.com|10/04/01 at 12:33:54|asteritius|xx|0|217.216.121.33|I´ve been on vacation in Banana Dominicana for the last 9 days and i´ve just found this situation.I WILL STAY HERE.I,m only an outcast but weeks ago i swore i´ll never leave this site.<br>I´m worried about what is happening here: I DO LOVE THIS COMMUNITYand i don´t wanna see it broken.I always feared a day like today,with all this people going away.<br>IT´S NOT TIME FOR A WAR , no matter the &quot;winner&quot; because at the end we will be DIVIDED and this community would be smaller and even destroyed.THE FUTURE OF ECCO´S COMMUNITY IS THE PROBLEM.We cannot choose a solution worse than the problem itself.Circle , Mover and Crimson...<br>ARE WE DIVIDED??.|||
