Re: Hi everyone !!!|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/28/01 at 20:23:41|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.176|Welcome to the family! &nbsp;I think generally it helps to like dolphins in order to appreciate the Ecco games. &nbsp;I remember seeing ads for the original Genesis game in a magazine...I couldn't believe my eyes--here was a game where you got to play as a dolphin! &nbsp;Dolphins are just about at the top of my list of favorite animals (and beleive me, that is a very long list), although I tend to like cats--big and small--best.<br><br>The full Latin name for bottlenose dolphins is &quot;tursiops truncatus.&quot; &nbsp;I know it by heart, but I'm just not sure if I've got the right spelling. &nbsp;I like common dolphins (delphinus delphis) myself, along with striped, spotted, spinner, and hourglass (those are so cute). &nbsp;Sorry, I don't know what that other one is you mentioned. &nbsp;I don't know what happened to that one coloring book I had of whales and dolphins...and it's not in my &quot;Whales&quot; Zoobook.<br><br>And, what is a &quot;dolphinolog&quot;? &nbsp;You mean like a dolphineer? &nbsp;A person who works with and trains dolphins?||

And, it's just something Crestoe's referred you to...er...heck I dunno...hehehe! Don't think much of it... ;)<br><br>Anyway, welcome to the site Stenellya... :D ...it's good to have a new Ecco fan around! I hope you stay, and become a part of us regulars here...seeya around!||
