Good for nuthin' Geocities! &gt;_&lt;|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|12/30/01 at 16:29:31|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.172.215|Sorry gang, but looks like my site's down. Or at least, I can't see it... <br>I figured this might happen sooner or later anyway so I'm going to be moving my site to angelfire. At least angelfire will give me 50 mb free instead of the shitty amount geocities offers. I have no idea how long this is gonna take, I guess I'll keep you all posted...not that I get many visiters there anyway. &nbsp;:-/ ||

Trouble is, I have to rebuild The Rift from scratch now. Every image, all the text....including all the fiction. o_O; <br><br>It's going to take a long time, but maybe I'll get a nicer site out of the deal in the long run. As I said before, I'll keep all of you posted on it's progress. &nbsp;<br><br>God this is gonna take ages..... &nbsp;-____-;||

Whatever Geocities was doing, it's not doin' it anymore. The site's there, and it looks like the updates published correctly also. &nbsp;:-/<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/blackfox71/index.htm<br><br>I got FOUR new paintings up, including one of Trellia from Tides of Time. Anyone who's interested can go check it out, and....maybe give me some feedback? &nbsp;:)||

I'm going to be selling the painting that I just added to my gallery. I did it late tonight, it's right below the Trellia painting. I'll be adding a new post to the off-topic board with details. Check it out if you want. ^_^<br>||

They've turned my site off a number of times. Still, my site remains in geocities...for all of you who haven't seen it, the link to it's in my sig. ;D||
