Oh well...made me think about something...ya said Arkon...about you and yogoat making a rule to get rid of the people who register and don't post within 24 hours...I mean...that's kinda drastic in my opinion. Lots of things could happen to prevent them from posting again before 24 hours is up...and well...that'd just turn them away if they seriously intended on coming back. Again, just my opinion...which doesn't count...but I'm voicing it anyway. Maybe something more like a week...or heck, 3 days...might be better...I dunno...I'd just hate for that to turn fans away from the site.||
