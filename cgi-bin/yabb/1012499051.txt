Lord of the Rings Games|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/31/02 at 10:44:07|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|I just wanted to post this because I see that there are a few LotR fans in here. There are three Lord of the Rings video games being planned to come out, with a lot more ahead.<br><br>&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; for the PSX2 planned to come out fall 2002, with the Hero as Aragorn, based on the movie. &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; for the XBox planned to come out in the later part of 2002 as well staring Frodo, based on the book. Then we have &quot;The Hobbit&quot; planned for 2003 for a next-gen system with the hero as our own little Bilbo, based on the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.<br><br>The one based on the movie looks best to me. I mean, what can a little hobbit do? Aragorn has a sword! Yes!||
