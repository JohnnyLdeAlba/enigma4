I know it's way past Halloween now, but I was just wondering if anyone did do trick-or-treating? I did, I did!!! Not for long, just had to get enough candy to last me and my mates the night. And that it did, it lasted [b]the night[/b]. There was pretty much none left the next day. We were to sick to eat it all anyways. &nbsp;:-X||
