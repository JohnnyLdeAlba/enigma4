Re: My thoughts of those leaving...|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|10/03/01 at 22:11:51|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.223.143|Okay, I'm sorry, but I do have to say something here. Now... listen, I've thought this for a while now. NOT that I don't have fun at this site and in the chat and all, because I do. But what I'll say below is what gets me...<br><br>On something you said in a different post, Arkon, that you're giving up on people, not the site. My God, that is one of the most ludicrous things I've ever heard! You can't let an internet website take the place of people, guy. It's no good. Granted both of us had our differences at one point but now that I've actually talked to you a lot more, you seem like a fun guy to know. Let other people know that, and for God's sake, don't lock yourself up in a room with HTML and Java and all that as your only friends! Grand that you made this site for... pride. And trust me, I envy your devotion to this site, too. (I worked on mine for what, a week? *laughs*)<br><br>Yes, the damned huggle and plushie posts got friggin', GOD DAMNED annoying. I agree.<br><br>What's this about 'wars' on the internet? That just sounds so stupid. Sorry, it sounds like something from a soap opera. &quot;Oh, my website is fighting a war with this website because Mr. SoandSo stole my Grandmother's prized ruby! The ABSOLUTE, HORRIBLE DISREGARD FOR HUMANITY!&quot; <br><br>Um, yeah. And I doubt that you could consider a bunch of people who post on a website and chat with each other a 'family'. Granted we're good... 'online' accquaintances, but unless you know someone from this site personally I doubt it goes any further than that...<br><br><br>Well yeah. That's about it. I had to get all that off my chest 'cause I felt like it. *shrugs* I'll still come to this site and chat with you guys because it's fun, and fun is what I do best. But somehow it just all works better when we're not all acting off the wall and down in the dumps depressive and shit, right? <br><br>I dunno, my two cents, I suppose. Sorry if it offended anyone, but hey, opinions are opinions, right?<br><br>|||
