Re: Earth Clan...revealed|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/25/01 at 19:54:56|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.59|Well I finally decided to read this when previously I just ignored it, but then I decided to see what it was about.<br><br>So, let me get this straight. It's DIFFERENT from the other Ecco games but it's LIKE DBZ. &nbsp;Now, I don't watch DBZ, I've only seen a few episodes (and to tell the truth I beleive it is one of the stupidest shows I have ever seen), so I thought that was all original, and wondered how you could have possibly come up with that stuff. But then I read Coral's comment about it reminding her of DBZ...But since I know very little about DBZ, I realize maybe this whole thing isn't really very similar at all except for perhaps a few small things...I wouldn't know...so I can't say it's unoriginal or uncreative (is that a word?). And especially since I could probably never come up with anything very original, so I should not have said anything at all. &nbsp;In fact, according to two people in particluar, whom probably none of you know, I have no originality...Er, but anyway, I still think the whole thing sounds really cool anyway...And I really need to learn to keep my big fat mouth shut (well..keyboard...erm...you know what I mean...), and I probably have pissed you off...I tend to do that... and I still never learn...but I apologize for my rudeness...The whole idea really is really cool...so, um, I'm going to shutup now....|||

Re: Earth Clan...revealed|GTK|gtkelpie@hotmail.com|10/27/01 at 01:24:51|GTK|xx|0|193.61.213.131|I think the DBZ thing was because of Arkonviox's many forms, that's all. After all, how many DBZ villains like to play tag with themselves? Frieza does it, Cell does it... etc. It's a DBZ-ish storyline, but not identical to any specific DBZ storylines I'VE ever seen. <br><br>Anyway, I'm intrigued. Arkon, if you need any help with write-ups/beta-reading/anything like that, let me know, okay? ;) (now that's an offer you don't get every day)|||
