Hey Trellia...|dolphingirl|dolphingirl@arkonviox.com|10/16/01 at 02:03:48|dolphingirl|xx|0|63.196.189.13|Hey Trellia...I just wanted to say thanks for that bit of news you put in the News section... ;) ...I found it informative, and I think it's the most solid information considering the sources I've seen yet about what the new Ecco game will be like for the PS2...so thanks!<br><br>I'm curious...does anyone here have a PS2 as of right now? If so do you plan to get Ecco when it comes out for it? If not, do you plan to buy a PS2, and if you did would you get the game?<br><br>I have a PS2 right now (actually got hella lucky and won it)...so I definitely plan to buy it when it comes out. What about anyone else?|||

Just in case something happens to my DC and I can't play that one anymore, it'll be nice to have a back-up on PS2. <br><br>Knowing that DoF is going to be on PS2 gives me great hope that a sequal is in the works, hopefully to be released in the next while on PS2... *please oh please oh please oh please....*|||

Having DotF come out for the PS2 leads me to believe the sequel won't die anytime soon... ;D ...a very nice thought indeed!
