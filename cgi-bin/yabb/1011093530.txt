The Whitefin Trilogy - Updated and rewritten|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/15/02 at 04:18:49|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.24.36|I rewrote the starting parts slightly so that it sounded better - and wrote a chunk more *is at a loss for anymore ideas, so shoo XD* If you get time Arky-boi, add this to the fanfiction section<br><br><br><br>Whitefin appeared in a swirl of bubbles in what would be an unknown sea, but she knew where she was perfectly. Whitefin swam out of the cavern she arrived in and made her way to the surface.<br><br>The Whitefin Trilogy - Book One - Behind Enemy Lines<br><br><br>Part One<br>Trellia's Bay, The start of the New Enemy.<br><br>Whitefin surfaced, her reptillian crest shifted in a breathing motion as they absorbed the air.<br>"Whitefin!" A shrill sweet voice of delight cried out. Whitefin looked above her only to come beak to beak with a great dolphin. "Trellia! How good to see you here" The Atlantean said, a usual cool edge to her voice.<br>"I never knew you'd come today" Trellia said as she 'swam' into a better view for her friend singer. "Us time keepers need to keep track of their friends" Whitefin laughed.<br>Whitefin usually acted as a coldhearted dolphin, but she was truly friendly, especially to Trellia, whom was more like the sister she never had.<br>Trellia smirked in a delphinic way as she lifted Whitefin from the waters and held onto her with her aura. Whitefin smiled snugly, she enjoyed a little flying at times.<br><br>But as the two where enjoying themselves...<br><br>Atlantis' deep enemy emerged from what was left of the center city, Forever. A newly formed body piercing the waters, a shadow casting across waters far and wide. "The oceans shall be mine... along with the rest of this primative planet!" and with that, the being let out a haunting laugh. The new hive was to start, here in the center of the sunken city...<br><br>***<br><br>Whitefin let out a wail of pain, Trellia dropped her in surprise. -SPLASH!!- Whitefin hit the water, she looked highly dazed and scared. "Whitefin?" Trellia asked, grabbing her friend with her oddly large fins and moving her to a small rock island. "Somethings-wrong" Whitefin gasped, a long chain of fear in her voice and in her eyes.<br>Atlantis....<br>  <br>***<br><br>The waters of Earth started to churn, as if crying for help. Even in the future, the ocean was seemingly dying. Pods of all species hid in the shadows, and even the great Slayer stayed well hidden.<br>The ruins of the once great city trembled, a wave of energy surging from it, seizing any life form in its grasp. The wave seemed to drag what it could into the ruins.<br>"Foolish beings thought they could be rid of me!" It snarled, its clawed fist smashing into a nearby wall. "Master, please do not stress yourself.. you need to regain your energy to take over Earth" A soft snivling voice said. "Yes.. your right Versuis..." The other replied, slithering thorugh the waters to the room of the lost Time Machine. "I need these chambers turned into breeding centers.. this room however.. will be the throne.." It spoke slowly, as if making sure that Versuis got it right. "Yes master, I will make sure the other chambers are built to your wishes" He said, bowing lowly in respect before leaving. "Yes.. this is perfect.. without that mediling guardian dolphin here.. I can do as I wish.." It cackled, and insane burst of laughter echoing across the waves. "The Vortex are back!"<br><br>***<br><br>"Go ack.. must go back.." Whitefin mumured, almost in a trance like state. Trellia had taken her to the Council of the Time to try and get anyone to have her make sence. All Whitefin did was babble constant things of 'going back'.  "Trellia, we understand your concearn - but she is making no sence" Ronuh said softy, his old eyes looking the Prehistoric Dolphin over. "Yes indeed, but you said that she was in a panic before, something about the present perhaps?" Altna ran through her thoughts, and then continued. "She has a mental link between the spirits of the Atlanteans, does she not?". "Yes, the spirits of Atlaneans.." Trellia spoke sturnly. "Surely that does not mean that she can determine what goes on in the different waters..." Trellia trailed off. "When a physical body dies.. it's spirit returns to Gaia, taking its memories and experiences with it - enabling Gaia to live and grow. By being linked with her ancestors means she is linked with the Gaia, and can feel every grain of stand that moves in the wind" Altna stated, her sleek purple tinted body hovering by Trellia. A silence hung over the rest of the Council, before a series of low mumbles of disbelief sounded. "Isn't the Gaia just a fairy tale told to young calfs?" A council dolphin asked. "It is not a fairy tale.. it is true" Ronuh spoke.  The silence that fell over the rest of the Council then was almost deafening, Trellia could barely stand it. "Atlantis.. need help.. Atlantis..." Whitefin murmured, her body trembling slightly. Oh Whitey.. Please snap out of it.. Trellia spoke telepathicly. Need help Atlantis was all that got sent back her way after that. "Atlantis... we go to the forbidden city.." Trellia spoke softly, almost as if she wasn't speaking. "Thats insane! You know that we are forbidden to enter the ruins!" Ronuh growled, outraged that one would think of doing so. "I have been there before.. we have nothing to worry about!" Trellia bit back, causing a stir of angry shouts amoung the others. "Silence!" Altna yealed, waiting for silence before continuing. "The young one has a point.. we should no longer fear the walls of our ancestors!". <br>The day turned into the night, and the night into the morning. Whitefin had recovered from her state, and was getting ready to head 'home'. "I'm coming with you" Trellia said softly. "Risk letting you get hurt? No way" Whitefin responded as she swam through a skyway. "The council allowed it. You can't do this on your own, what if you go into the trance again?" Trellia cought up as Whitefin swamn faster. With a sigh, Whitefin turned. "I can't win, can I?". <br><br>***<br><br>"Master, the main chambers have been turned into the breeding centers as you asked" Versius bowed his head lowly in respect. The Vortex Queen turned, her insectoid like form in a heavy outplacement from the stone walls. "Training Centers, Food Storage, Army Quaters.." She trailed off, her ten arms working all with the same motion as she continued. "I will need to start my breeding cycle soon, and that means that it will be my feeding state as well.." She growled lowly, memories flooding back of the pesky young dolphin Ecco. "We will make sure that you are not interupted.. permission to speak freely, master?" Versuis folded his four arms together. "Granted" The Queen turned and swam lazily around the room. "Do you really think that the prehistoric one will cause any threat to us?" He asked nimbly. "Yes.. she is more powerful than the Asterite.. but her quest for her family blinds her.." She replied, four insectoid eyes gazing up through the holes in the ceiling. Versuis watched silently, before asking yet another question. "Shall we dispose of this prehistoic being? If she is this powerful, she could surely harm you in a weak state like breeding. We don't want to see a repeat of events happen to you". The Queen cringed, clenching multiple fists. "Destroy her with your best forces.. and if you become deparate.." She trailed off, the expression on her face was readable enough. "I understand, this tim we will contain her after she finishes her task.." Versuis ten slipped away into the shadows, leaving the queen alone to her tasks.<br><br>||

Re: The Whitefin Trilogy - Updated and rewritten|NeoEcco|neoecco1@hotmail.com|01/23/02 at 22:48:59|NeoEcco|xx|0|12.232.110.252|i'd like to try and go for that offered position in your story, Whitefin! that is far too good an offer to pass up!  :D<br><br>i believe i would probably fit best in the vortex future, seeing as my kind probably came about during that time. and [i]in[/i] the globe, you say? O_o well... i guess i can deal with that!  ;)<br><br>   i would be a flier just like Trellia's species... however, we're not as lucky as to possess the ability to carry objects with our mind. in fact, it was just around that time the dolphin clans, including my own, were planning on space flight... ourselves, what was left of the humans, and other dolphin clans like the Star-Fall and Tide-Runner. <br><br>   i believe it would be fascinating, though, our clans encountering the ferocity of the new vortex hive before they were supposed to destroy the planet... if, of course, you want that to be part of the story, i'm not sure... feel completely free to alter the plot any way you wish to help it fit into what you have planned! i certainly do not mind, the pleasure of being part of the trilogy is honor enough!<br><br>   i do hope you find some of this helpful to you, i believe you know of such other details i have not mentioned... i will be happy to answer any questions you may have to help you along... good luck to you on this, my friend!<br>||

I hope you keep it up! I know what writer's block is like... bleh... but it goes away if you poke it with a 'shoo stick'! Well not really... I guess I'm up too early today...<br><br>So keep it up!
