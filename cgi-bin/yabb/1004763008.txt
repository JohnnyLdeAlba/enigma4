I am STUCK|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/02/01 at 21:50:08|Tethys|angry|0|205.188.197.158|Okay, I finally played Ecco: DotF again, and I started a new game (since I had deleted my old game after I hadn't played it for a while). Of course, I'm still at about the same point I was last time--at the Perils of the Coral Reef. &nbsp;Yes, I know, I'm a loser, but it just so happens that I suck at every single game that I ever play. &nbsp;Anyway, I thought that before I had gotten all the vitalit crystals, but now I can't find ANY. Except for the one you get when you race those dolphins in the beginning. &nbsp;I don't know if it's necesary to find them in order to get to the next level, but I don't want to go any further until I do.<br><br>Also, the last time I played it I couldn't figure out how to beat that big shark. &nbsp;Just simply attacking it didn't seem to do any good, so I am wondering if there's some sort of strategy to it.|||

Everything you need to know|GTK|gtkelpie@hotmail.com|11/03/01 at 01:47:16|GTK|xx|0|193.61.213.130|Er... uh... cripes, it's been far too long since I got those vitalits =P Try this: <br><br>When you leave the first lagoon, turn left. Go past the sharks to the place where you leap over the rock. Instead of leaping over, dive to the bottom here and look around. I'm pretty sure there's one just lying on the sand waiting for you. <br><br>When you leave the first lagoon, turn right. Go past the sharks to the place where there's a tunnel with a fierce current. On the opposite side of the channel there's a dip that leads down to a gem. I think a vitalit is down here somewhere. <br><br>There is a vitalit in the great white's lagoon, above the waterfall in the corner he's circling through. I really think you should kill him before you try to get this, though =P <br><br>So, uh, plus the one from the dolphin race, that's four vitalits... oh wait, I remember. I think there's another one in the Great White's lagoon. It's just a little way down the dark tunnel. <br><br><br><br>It would be best if, before you tackled Ol' Whitey, you picked up the three free Songs that are going. <br><br>Song of the Shark: find the dolphin's brother. The dolphin is past the place you have to jump (turn left out of the starting lagoon). Talk to him then jump back over to find his brother. Lead his brother over the jump and you'll be taught the song to defeat sharks. IT DOES NOT WORK ON WHITEY. <br><br>The Shark Song lets you stop a shark in mid-charge. This makes fighting the little beggars a cinch as you can just let them come up to you, then stop them and give them a thump. Everything except Whitey will be foiled by this, but squeaking at him just seems to make him fighting mad. <br><br>Song of the Turtle: the dolphin's brother has a turtle that is being attacked by sharks. Drive them off for him (with your Song of the Shark) and he will teach you the Song of the Turtle as thanks. <br><br>As far as I can tell, you only really need this once, and that's to pick up the Power of Stealth later on. Still, get it anyway. <br><br>Song of the Fish: further on from the turtles, there's a long lagoon with a bunch of slow-moving sharks in (now you have the Shark Song you can zap their candy arses into immobility and ram them). There's also a dolphin here that mindlessly chases a fish around and around. To get the Song of the Fish you have to catch his fish. Lurk in wait and charge when they go past and you'll get lucky eventually. <br><br>This is very very useful, although I didn't figure out why until I was well into Part Two -_-; You can attract two very special sets of fish like this. You must've come across the poison fish before... if you attract them, sharks and other predators will leave you alone. Not Whitey, though, he's not fooled by such pathetic ploys. But, attracting poison fish allows you to swim through that piranha tunnel without even a scratch. You can even swim right up to the sharks and bonk them on the heads and they won't do a thing about it! (Of course, charging with a bunch of fish in tow can be dangerous as Ecco tends to eat the poison fish when he charges &gt;_o;) The other thing is the glowing fish. Attract these and you can swim through that dark tunnel (which for some reason is bright green inside). If you have glowing fish with you, you can avoid the Mysterious Creeping Death that lurks inside these tunnels. <br><br><br><br>Oh, and killing Ol' Whitey... You need to lure him through the small hole as Arkon said at first, and steal the Power by touching his jaws while he's trapped (he's only trapped for a few seconds so do NOT hang around that mouth). That lets you use the first of the ability glyphs (there's one above the rock with the holes in). Once you have that, you can kill the Great White by powering up, lurking just out of range and then ramming him broadside. It takes around six hits to kill him, I think. The only way Ecco can injure him is by using the ability glyph. |||

I was a stickler for finging them all before moving on. It's not necessary to do so, but I had to. I'm one of those &quot;have-to-get-100%-people&quot;...heheh! They do give you a bigger health bar, just for that section of the game (Islands of Tranquility/Dolphins Nightmare/etc)...so I didn't think it was worthless finding them all. I've got 100% of the vitalits on the whole game...if you ever need help, let me know...and I'll do my best to direct you to their locations... ;) ...happy Ecco playing till then!|||

I looked high and low throughout the rest of the level, but I guess I didn't look hard enough. &nbsp;Unless the shards that won't let you pass w/o the power of vigor just lead to some other section of the same level, rather than to the next level (as there are more than one of them).|||
