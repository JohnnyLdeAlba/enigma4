Re: Art Gift for the Forum #2.|Crestoe|Crestoe@arkonviox.com|01/11/02 at 01:11:22|Crestoe|xx|0|63.253.227.151|HOLAY SHIT! YA GOT CRESTOE PERFECTED! O_O<br><br>Great pic Swift! Yer the first one ever to get Crestoe in perfect order. Sept the fins look like bat wings, BUT WHO CARES! The pic rocks totally! Just on behalf of everyone, mosltly myself, Thank you!<br><br>I feel i owe ya one!<br><br>Just the quickly clear somethin up, the reason Crestoe has the froggie looking arms and the weird tail is becuz he doesnt need them. He squiggles in a side to side motion much like an Eel. (sp?) His fins, part arms, are hard and strong. They are like human arms, he uses them to dig through rock. The thirians are sup-terranian dolphins. Just had to clear that up.||01/11/02 at 01:22:56|Crestoe
Re: Art Gift for the Forum #2.|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|01/11/02 at 04:46:01|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.172.17|I had a feeling there was a reason like that, why he had those unusual pectoral fins. I figured that givin' ya DRAGON (not bat!) wings would compliment the over all design. Well, I think it looks neat, but that's just me....XD<br><br>Notice how ornate and flowwy the tail is? I wasn't sure about the tail, so just did something ornamental, not nessisaraly functional. I'm a sucker for scientifically plausable anatomy...but not ALL the time. I'm glad your happy with it Crestoe, I really wasn't sure how you'd like it.  :)||

And gee, I'm even in it, which left me in shock cause I didn't think anyone even knew me. But I just want to say, it rocks!!! Those pics are the coolest ever! Your a very amazing artis, no argument there. Keep up the sensational work!!!<br>I love what you did with my character. I prefer it way more over that ugly Train. I don't know how I even got that name, but I like it way better now that you did it like that! Thank you sooo much!!! I love it! I think my I'd like my character to be pictured like that from now on. I love it so much! Makes me want to be more of a dolphin and Ecco fan. ^_^<br>Thanks again! The whole thing is great!||01/11/02 at 17:59:48|Doomtrain

I wanted to add her just cuz she's good friends with other board users, but I couldn't draw an actual train, so I figured since everyone else is an aquatic critter of one distinction or another that I'd "morph" her into a dolphin form. I figured that a chrome dolphin with a scull and crossbones image on her forehead would be unique and interesting, and it seemed to fit her nick'. ^^;;<br><br>I'm happy that you liked it Doom'.  :)||

You can go down the street for like 4 blocks and have everything from starbucks to movie theaters ^_^ it always was convenient, and there are some really beautiful part of the west side (where i was livin') where all the streets have rowns upon rown of cherry trees, and when spring hits, you have little pink petals everywhere :) it was an awsome place to live ^^||

I'm happy to see you all like those pictures enough to use it that way.<br><br>*is flattered actually*<br><br>You lucky bumb! I visited Calgary several times on my way through to Salmo and Nelson BC where my Aunt was livin' years ago.  It's a neat place.....flat as pi$$ on a plate, but it gives the mountians in the distance a cool effect. *giggles*<br><br>Here's a question for ya Doom', does the wind EVER STOP in Calgary???! Ever time I was there, the wind was blowin' enough to rock my Uncle's car as we drove on the highway away from the Airport!

Well you can come here, but make sure you bring back some Leafs stuff. &nbsp;;)<br>Yeah the wind stops...rarely, but it does. There's pretty much always a breez though, it gets really strong in the fall it seems. And the mountains are really nice in the background. It nice to be in a city where no matter where you are you can see the moutains...well, except downtown. That place is the pits.||
