Chaos in Argentina|Cerebro|fcbg@ciudad.com.ar|12/20/01 at 13:52:58|Cerebro|thumbdown|0|200.42.74.192|Im very very scared about the actual situation of my country... Lots of people are protesting, our president is blind and he dont care about. Today, the police killed 4 people with a fire gun. The protest was a pacific one, but the police started a civil war at the &quot;Plaza de Mayo&quot; square. Im preety worried about our situation, if you want more information about that, read an online newspaper, or also contact me.||
