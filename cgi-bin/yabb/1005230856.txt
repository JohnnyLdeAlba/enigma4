Heehee. I was wondering something...my Sega Genesis system is pretty old...9 years old, soon to be 10 this christmas. My bro and i both go one for xmas one year. his is dead. i dun word anymore...and mine is beginning to have the same symptoms his did before is died...Mainly, it takes severaly tries to get a game working, and one of the power cables in the back is easily knocked out with just the lightest touch and it hard to get it working again. Does anyone else have this problem?<br><br>*sniffs her sweater again* geez i LOVE this smell...im going to go hug someone so they can smell it too...|||

My Genesis: If you either touch the game cartridge (while the game is playing), or if you nudge the console by accident, the game freezes and you have to turn it of and turn it back on...... :( (RESET button doesn't seem to work - I think).<br><br>2. the Controller: one of it's buttons (button A) doesn't work very well (actually it does, but only if you press it like really hard). :( (the other controller works fine).|||

Re: I smell so good....|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/09/01 at 21:28:00|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.106.36|I have the EXACT same problem with my Genesis, Vantid. &nbsp;I used that black electrical tape the cord (the one that connects to the tv) to the system in a certain position, because it seems it has to be in the exact right position in order to work. &nbsp;I often end up taking out the cartridge and putting it back in about a hundred times before it will work. &nbsp;And then the picture is sometimes a little fuzzy, but I think that has to do with the RF cable. &nbsp;Occasionly, tho this is rare, the system will even freeze up. &nbsp;This usually happens if I have itpaused too long, or sometimes even if I ahve just paused it. &nbsp;Also, the reset button is stuck somehow, so I can't reset the game without turning the system off and back on. &nbsp;I've had mine for about 8 years. &nbsp;It's at the cottage, and we only go there on weekends during the summer and sometimes during the winter just to check on things, and even when we are there I don't play it much. That might have contributed to its current condition. &nbsp;|||
