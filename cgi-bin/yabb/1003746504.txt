Re: New Dolphin Artwork :)|vantid|vantid@arkonviox.com|10/24/01 at 10:27:54|vantid|xx|0|207.80.104.200|Well of course they are expensive...thats what it means to buy QUALITY products. They are top of the line...there is no other brand that matches them. The only thing that comes even close is spectracolor. Money should not be an option...you see, most proffesional art materials are expensive, colores pencils being the cheapest. i mean, compare the price of one dollar for a PC(prismacolor) to 20 or even 30 dollars for a top notch tube of paint or 60 to 120 dollars for one shmearin paintbrush(these are the extremes sure, but the pencil's highest price is 1.20...that ive seen.)|||
Re: New Dolphin Artwork :)|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|10/24/01 at 16:42:38|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.171.71|I agree with Vantid. Sure they are expensive, but they're worth it! <br><br>This can be included in almost any kind of art supply. More money spent equals better quality, brigher color, and longer lasting material. For the most part anyway...except if your supplier is crooked and your being taken for a ride! XD|||
