O_O I can't wait to see what happens next! &nbsp;It was sad the way Bry'eeba did that thing to Taniel's bro. (Can't give it away for the others! ;))||

Even tho it was a bit greusome as far as I'm concerned.  But that didn't bother me.  It got better as it went along, and ends at just the right note to make you want to know what happens next.<br><br>I never played DotF past The Perils of the Coral Reef (or whatever that level was called) so there were a few minor things I was uncertain of.  But it was written in such a way that I think even someone who had never heard of Ecco wouldn't be lost.<br><br>The story turned out very different than what I expected at first.    At first I wasn't certain I would like the plot, despite that it was so well-written.  But in the end, I am intrigued and I can't wait to find out what happens next.||
