This is the first of two pic's. Anyone who wasn't put in this pic' will be added into the next one.  :)<br><br>I ran out of room, there's NO way that I could add everyone to one single picture, we couldn't all fit! Don't worry tho', your character should be on the next one.  ;)||

You know what i hate is when a person has to owe picts like my brother having to owe people them stupid "exchanges" thats why he used to never be here...hes getting to the point of retiring for a while on those...i hope ^_^;<br><br>Anyhow just take it easy and don't listen to them people! if they want to be in a pict so bad i shall do one with stick figures and names pointing then we will all be happy...<br><br>hmmm sounds like a good idea||
