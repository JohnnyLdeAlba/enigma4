Friecco, I'm not familiar at all with what kinds of stores you guys there in NZ have, but here in the US, we have a store called Kinkos. It's a photo copying center that now has computers equiped with scanners. You go in, use the computer/scanner, save the pic to your own disc (or buy one from them), and you pay them a small amount for the time you used it. It's quite a handy way to get around a sitiation like yours. Maybe you could check into whether or not there are any places like that there...that'd be helpful if you could find such a place. Anyway, just suggestions... :) ...hope you get something worked out!|||
