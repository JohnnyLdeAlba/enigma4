When i posted that i was new at the forum and the Ecco community i taked a bit about this game. The topic was so popular that i decided to post a new topic only for this game.<br><br>Its ok, but... What the fuck is E.V.O.???<br>I dunno what  those letters means, but its seems to be something like evolution and eden cause thats the point of the game. U start like a little-cutie-fish (thats why it reminds me of Ecco) in a water world and u have to start evolving your body to continue with the lifes history (u know, the fish, the dinosaurs, the mammals...) Its similar to an RPG because u got points for killing other animals. U better download it, the game is avadible for SNES so its possible to find the rom.<br><br>Well, dunno what to say, just try it if u havnt played it (or also if ur curious). If u have layed it, just post something :)<br><br>[center][glow=red,2,300]BUT REMEMBER THAT ECCO IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!![/glow][/center]|NS|12/22/01 at 22:55:10|Cerebro

Re: E.V.O.|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/23/01 at 20:25:50|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.195.28|Yes, it is Phantasy Star. &nbsp;That is the name of the game series. &nbsp;You should play them sometime, but I reccommend IV over the rest. &nbsp;Of course, that is the only one I played all the way through--I never had the chance to play the first one. &nbsp;<br><br>But my point was that I am hesitant to download any emulators or ROMs. &nbsp;One reason is because they take up a lot of disc space. &nbsp;Another reason is that the last time I did that, somebody deleted them all and there is a good chance that will happen again. &nbsp;But the main reason is that if I downlowded a SNES emulator and then a ROM for EVO, or any other emulators and ROMs, I probably would almost never play them anyway. Regardless of how much I like the game. &nbsp;It's just the way I am. I love playing video games, but I hardly ever play them, no matter how good they are.||

I don't think it will ever happen (just a rumor, I guess), but in that magazine it mentions EVO, and says: it will be released on (not sure which one) GameBoy Advance or GameBoy Color, or GameCube..... or whatever.||
