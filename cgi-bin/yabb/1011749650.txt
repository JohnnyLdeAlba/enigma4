Its very easy.<br><br>First, go get on about 5 active forums. Then get yourself about 6 active IRC channels. Toss in about 3 email lists.<br><br><br>You'll wake up one day and suddenly realize between moderating, oping, reading, posting and chatting, you have no life at all :)<br><br><br>||

Re: good way to waste time OL?|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|01/23/02 at 14:39:40|Shadow|xx|0|192.168.0.1|That can't be too hard. Just rember that the animation system is a spline cycler (its actually a sine wave frequency, so half the hard work is done for you) and that bones/muscles operate on forward kinematics.||
