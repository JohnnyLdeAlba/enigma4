I almost wish I had seen the episode(s) with Knuckles in it.  But Tails wasn't in it at all that I have seen.<br><br>Eao, what is Killiranshello?<br><br>I haven't heard any character voices other than the English version, but personally I like Knuckles' voice.  And Shadow's, too.  In the English version, of course, like I said.  I like Sonic's and Tails' SA voices better than SatAM altho they are actually pretty simular, at least Sonic's is.<br><br>Amy is pretty annoying, but I still think she's cool anyway.  I liked her in the comics before SA came out, she was a little better then.<br><br>Anyone seen the anime?  I own it, but I only watched it once.  Knuckles sounded more like I imagined he would in that one, but I still like his SA voice better.  And Tails sounds like he's got a cold.  The anime was okay, but a lot of it was pretty stupid.  I didn't like that Sera.  What is she supposed to be anyway with the tail? And I think she had cat ears too.<br><br>Does anyone else read the comics?  I don't want to talk about if no one will know what I'm talking about.||

Anyways, I don't like Sonic Underground, but I liked the ones with Scratch and Grounder in 'em. And then there was the really kool episodes where Robotnik ruled the world, and there was Sally Acorn, Sonics grandfather (who was a robot). One character I remember in particular was a rabbit who was half robot.<br>There was also something about a special gold ring which made him go even faster and let him run up walls.<br>Trouble is, I forgot what those episodes were called....<br>I'll shut up now... &nbsp;:-/||

Re: Do you like Sonic ?|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/19/02 at 17:00:57|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Time for my two cents (and it'll prob'ly take me a while)!<br><br>I've loved Sonic for years and years and years. Matter of fact, doing Sonic related stuff basically took up all of my time when I was in like... grades 2 to 6... and a little of 7. Now I'm not as obsessed as I used to be, but in the history of stuff I've liked, Sonic runs up there in the really high ranks...<br><br>Characters: Well, my favorite characters in the history of Sonic, I'd have to say... Knuckles is my favorite, with Shadow next, Tails, Rouge and Sonic. Y'know, I thought I'd wind up hating Rouge, but when I got SA2 I realized SHE KICKS ASS! But Amy pisses me off, though... she's got such a squeaky voice (in Japanese. I don't listen to the English voices) and it's enough to make me want to bash my head against the wall every now and again.<br><br>Games: I loved 'em all, to be honest, but my favorite for the Sega Genesis HAD to be when you locked Sonic &amp; Knuckles onto Sonic 3 and you got that super huge ass game to play with all those nifty ways to play it! And for Dreamcast, well I liked Sonic Adventure 2 a lot more than the first one. And the Chaos are so cute! <br><br>D'you know, I got so pissed off when the Sonic Adventure toys came out. I was like &quot;If they'd only put 'em out a few years earlier, I woulda had a ball with these things!&quot; It's true. And you know what, that always happens to me... &nbsp;:P<br><br>Shows: My favorite Sonic show was, above and beyond all the others, &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. I LOVED that show to death! It was so cute, and so funny, and Scratch and Grounder were hysterical! (And yes, I still think this is true!) I think the crappiest was Sonic Underground. I'm sorry, I just thought it sucked.<br><br>Comics: I've read up to about 54 or so in the Archie Sonic comics. And anyone else here who's read them, tell me... do you think Sally was a bitch in those? Because I sure did. That, and she was a whore. I mean, she liked Sonic, Knuckles, Antoine and that stupid retarded skunk St. John or whatever. Skanky bitch. The Britney Spears of Sonic World.<br><br>And I agree with Kitnee... Shadow's Japanese voice is sexy. I dunno why. It just is.<br><br>Anyway, I'm done now!<br>||

Re: Do you like Sonic ?|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/20/02 at 19:28:37|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.197.186|Well Amy's English voice is also incredibly annoying.  But, like I said, I liked her in the older comics after Sonic CD came out.  I don't like her so much in SA.<br><br>I've always liked Sally.  She was better before, tho, before the whole comic started to go downhill.  She was even better in the earlier days.  But I think I liked her best in SatAM.  And just to clear some things up, she never liked Antione like that, it was Twan that used to have a huge crush on Sally before he fell in love with Bunny.  And, at first I thought she had a thing for Knuckles in the Mecha Madness special.  But it turned out they used to be very close friends when they were little kids, and she probably just wanted to catch up on things.<br><br>And, it's Nack, not Knack (I used to want to spell it that way all the time).  He was in Triple Trouble for the Game Gear.  But I never had a Game Gear.  But he also made a few appearances in the comic, and from that I always thought he was cool.  Apparantly in Japan he was called Fang the Sniper.  Then Archie introduced his sister, Nic, who looks just like him.  How original.  It reminds me of the kinds of characters I used to come up with in my earliest days of Sonic fanhood (actually I did come up with a character named Kelsey who was supposed to be Nack's sister).  But, even tho she's only made two appearances so far, I still think Nic's pretty cool.<br><br>I think that, not counting any characters that ever appeared in a game, my favorite character from the comic is Bunny.  Ever since issue #3 where she first appeared, which was also the first issue I ever owned.  Not the first one I ever read, tho, because one of my friends had shown me #1.<br><br>I already said I liked Sally.  I forgot to mention that I like Mighty quite a bit, but, never having owned a 32X, I never played Knuckles Chaotix where he and the other Chaotix made their first appearance.  I also grew to like Julie-Su quite a bit, and now she's up there among my favorites.  I liked Mina, the new character, from the start, but they ruined her by suddenly giving her super speed which she never had before and not giving an explanation.  It kinda ruins the uniqueiness of Sonic, it makes him no longer "the fastest thing alive".  Um...well that's about it, or at least all I can think of now.  If there was ever a character I hated, it's Geoffry St. John.  Ever since his debut in Sally's mini-series I've always  thought he was a big jerk.  And he's only gotten worse.<br><br>I'm afraid I don't know who this "Orphen" character is, Eao...||
Re: Do you like Sonic ?|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/21/02 at 10:36:41|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|Yeah, the skunk was a jerkoff. I hated him.<br><br>And I dunno... Sally used to be cool, until she started playing all the guys in the damn comic... ;)||
Re: Do you like Sonic ?|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/21/02 at 11:01:30|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|I wasn't really a big fan of Sally either. Actually I didn't really like any of the gang that weren't in the games. I just liked the original Sonic and Tail theme I guess. But I did like the comics, allthough they suck ass now. I really like the old cartoon too. &nbsp;;D Those were the best! And I love Shadow....voice, looks, shoes. He's so cool. But I still loce Tails best for cuteness. But sorry Tails, cool over cute, you're second best to me now. I really love the sonic adventure games. And since the Dreamcast has gone down in price, yet agian, I could get one if I really wanted. Instead of getting a $100 hair cut, maybe I should get a $80 Dreamcast. But of course the only games I would play would be Sonic, Ecco and Skies of Arcadia, and since those are all the games Delphi has...I'll just go and play them at her house. &nbsp;;) Hee hee, to bad Sonic isn't going to Playstation, cause Ecco and SoA are, so I'd be all set!

Re: Do you like Sonic ?|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/21/02 at 20:05:50|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.41|Well at first they said Sally was a squirrel.  Now they are saying she is half-squirrel and half-chipmunk.  Her father, King Max, is a squirrel, and her mother, Queen Alicia, is a chipmunk.<br><br>The french one is Antione, Twan for short.  Or, as Bunny calls him lately, "Sugah-Twan".  At one time, they said in Sonic Grams that he was a fox, and then somebody asked where his tail was, and they said he donated it to Tails.  But earlier, they had said Tails was just born that way, which is really the case.  They seem to change everything everytime they get a new editor.  Anyway, I think at one time they said Antione is a coyote, so I'm sticking to that for now even tho he has no tail.  He used to have a tail, but it was short, and then it just dissappeared.  He never had an accent until SatAM (codename for the old Saturday morning cartoon that had the comic characters in it) came out where he had a French accent.  <br><br>It seems like many people have the misconception that the comic is based off SatAM.  But, being a subscriber from issue #3, I know thatthe comic was out for quite a while before the SatAM cartoon came out.  SatAM was based off the comic's characters, but it added some things.  After it had been out for a while, Archie changed things to reflect what was new in the cartoon.  SatAM introduced the character Dulcey (who didn't appear inthe comic until much later), Also, Boomer's name was changed to Rotor in the cartoon, and Sally was given a new look.  Nicole, Sally's handheld computer, was also introduced in the cartoon.  And Robotnik was given the name Julian Kintobar, as his real name, along with a past, something he never really had before.  In time, Archie added and changed these things to match the cartoon, and I think that's about the time when the comic started to become more serious.||
