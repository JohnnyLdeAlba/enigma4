I think that you should either<br>1. Re-Download the Rom<br>and/or 2. Try a different emulator (My best bet is DGen for Windows because I have had many problems with Generator - depending on what type of machine you riun it on).<br><br>I hope that can help you!<br><br>~Ange||

Just small tiddly bits that are different.||
