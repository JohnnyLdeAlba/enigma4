er, hi there|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/07/01 at 20:40:46|Guest|smiley|0|152.163.201.47|[color=Blue]Hi, my name is Tiarra, but you can call me Tia.  Well, that's not my real name, it's actually the name of my main character.  You'll have to ask me to find out my real name.  I'm not sure what to say.  I never actually beat any of the Ecco games (except Ecco Jr, but it's impossible -not- to beat that).  I pretty much gave up halfway through each one. And then I suck at every video game I ever play.  Actually, I only played the DC game once after I bought it, and gave up when I couldn't figure out how to beat that stupid shark.  I probably would have played it more, but then I started playing other games and pretty much forgot about it. But I am still a big fan of Ecco.  Oookay this mesage has gotten quite a bit longer than I had intended, so I will shutup now for the time being.[/color]|||

I know the Ecco games can become difficult and comfusing at times. So I have some &nbsp;sugestions. First, they made a stratagy guied to Ecco DotF for the Dreamcast. Buy it. Second, if you want to finnish the other ecco games you can play them on your computers by emulators (ask if you do not know what they are). I think you can find guides to them at www.gamefaqs.com. You can also use the cheats, which help out alot. Well, Welcome to Arvonix, the Ecco site that reaches threw out the ages!|||

Re: er, hi there|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/10/01 at 19:21:40|Guest|xx|0|152.163.204.59|[color=Purple]Actually it's kinda funny how I came upon this site.  Okay, maybe not...But, I only came here because of the art contest at first.  I got an e-mail from Arkonviox asking if I was an artist and if I would be interested in entering the contest.  So I asked for more information and he gave me a link to the site.  So I went, and I was like &quot;Woah! Dude! It's an Ecco site!&quot; (I don't normally say &quot;dude,&quot; but then I didn't actually say it, I thought it).  And I decided it was one of the best sites I ever saw.  So, it's kinda funny how things turn out like that.  :P[/color]|||
Oh yeah|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/10/01 at 19:26:13|Guest|xx|0|152.163.204.59|I nearly forgot about what else I was gonna say. &nbsp;I said that &nbsp;I never beat any of the Ecco games. &nbsp;Well, I lied. &nbsp;Actually, I just didn't think of the fact that I DID beat The Tides of Time, but that was with the cheat mode, so it doesn't count. &nbsp;And of course it says something to the effect of &quot;next time, try playing the game without the cheat mode.&quot;|||
