It's too complex to explain but you cant get perl to work for you on the fly you have to understand how to upload properly how to configure scripts and alot more if i were you eao id use sites with ready made yabb like http://www.xsorbit.com id like to help but if you knew me you knew i hate helping with anything.<br><br>Perl is very complex it took me a long time to learn and i learned it to keep up with blackfin back in the olden days. Who would of known i could surpass him and the only reason was i knew how to program too...||
