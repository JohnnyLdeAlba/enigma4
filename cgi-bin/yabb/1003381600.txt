Re: Arkonviox's Artwork|Echo Lee|echolee5@hotmail.com|10/21/01 at 12:44:52|Echo_Lee|xx|0|165.247.73.130|Here's an idea for you Arkon. Bring some paper and a pencil or pen with you when you go to work. Whenever there is nothing to do or its during break just start doing some quick sketches on anatomy and all that. You have the talent, but since you gave up i don't think you'll be as good as Tass or Vantid, no offense, but you draw pretty good for someone who hasn't been drawing for several years. My advice, so I'll shut up now.<br><br>|||
