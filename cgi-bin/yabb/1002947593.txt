Re: Question...|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|10/12/01 at 23:16:19|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.8.112|Ecco is a game based on a dolphin hero who saved Earth from an alien race called the vortex.<br><br>But many rumors around the story cisculate such as why does Ecco have five star markings upon his head? All i remember is those markings have to do with the dolphin god Apollo.<br><br>Ecco's mission is to travel through alternate version of the future...the dark future ruled by the vortex and the good future ruled by dolphins with long long fins who could fly into the air like birds...<br><br>eccos way to travel through time was always something different...other dolphins or the time machine of the ancient atalnteans<br><br>Ecco did defeat the vortex in the story but in the end he was faced to destroy the atlantean timemachine and instead of destroying it he used it and dissappeared into the tides of time forever!<br><br>The sotry of Arkon is much different though hes apart of a story im working on based on ecco the dolphin.|||
Stars|Tiarra|isoandorai@aol.com|10/13/01 at 13:56:26|Guest|xx|0|205.188.193.33|The dolphin god Apollo?? Since when was Apollo a dolphin? He's the god of light and truth, or something, and later became the god of the sun. The markings on Ecco's head represent the constellation, Delphinus, the dolphin. Poseidon, the god of the sea, sent the dolphin Delphinus to fetch the nereid (sea nymph) Amphitrite so that Poseidon could marry her. &nbsp;Poseidon thanked Delphinus by placing his image in the stars. &nbsp;<br>In ToT, in one of levels that takes place in Atlantis (I can't remember which one), there is a room with several glyphs, explaining the whole deal with the Vortexes, one which says the the Vortex world is inside the constellation Pegasus, and another that says the closest constellation to Pegasus is Delphinus, the dolphin.|||
