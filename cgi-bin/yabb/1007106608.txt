So much info about Ecco *drools*<br><br>I come from Germany, if anybody knows about it, it's in Europe :P<br><br>I can only go online in the university, if I get a place at a computer there, that is... :/ Internet is pretty expensive for a student who has practically no money...<br><br>Anyway, I will definately look here again, this is the best Ecco site to date!! :D||

Like vantid said...I hope you actually stay too! There's too many newbies who make a &quot;one-time&quot; appearance...which sucks. So, hopefully you'll enjoy this place enough to return...many times! Oh yeah, and you're from Germany...?...that's cool. A dear fellow Ecco friend of some of us here, PsySonic (webmaster for Caverns of Hope), is also from Germany. Perhaps you'll meet up with him sometime! Anyway, again...welcome!||
