Y'know, the one where you have to solve a word puzzle to get through? I'm not gonna ask what it contains but I do want to know : IS IT WORTH THE TROUBLE?<br><br>PS: This is w/out doubt THE coolest Ecco page I have ever visited. ;D||

I believe one person here spoke up and voiced their opinion about the &quot;Secret Page&quot; not being very cool...and not worth the effort...but it was to me. I think us old-timers who know the whole history of this site appreciate it more than the newer people. However that's not to say you wouldn't like it. If I were you, I'd wanna know either way...so keep at that Word Search till you figure it out. Don't rush or anything...but do it when you have time...and [i]read every bit of instruction carefully[/i]...or you may get confused.<br><br>About the site &quot;Caverns of Hope&quot;...I do know who the webmaster is...and so does most everyone else here. His name's PsySonic...(cool guy if you ask me)...why do ya ask?<br><br>Anyway, I hope that answers all yer questions... :)||

I just thought I'd run into a thread that explained it all...but perhaps I'm wrong...hmmm...interesting to say the least.<br><br>Anyway, back to Aziel's question about the Ecco game coming out for the PS2...just to clarrify things...eventhough it will be a port...it will have a couple new things on it as well. Perhaps the biggest improvment will be a new sonar map which will help guide you as to which task you should be doing (to my understanding anyway). The graphics may be improved too. And as I've stated in the past...who cares if it's just a port...at least it's something, and therefore can promise for a better chance of the long awaited sequel to &quot;Defender of the Future&quot;...right!? Right!!! :wink:||
