A proposed idea!|Trellia|Liz_2emeadow@hotmail.com|10/10/01 at 21:06:59|Trellia|xx|0|24.78.125.249|Ok heres an idea (sorry, this is really early, but if i didnt post it now, id forget later.... x.x)<br><br>ok, well, i this'll be for x-mas, but anyway, here i go...<br><br>What if we did some sort of &quot;secret santa&quot; thing, ya know, exchanging &quot;presents&quot; with our secret person, i dunno if u guys'll wanna do it, but i participated in one @ another forum a looooooong time ago, and it seemed to work out fine. Instead of actuall presents, we exchanged animatons, graphics, pictures, and even made web pages for the person....<br><br>besides, it'll be a nice way to meet others, especially for the newbies....<br><br>anyway, if you hate the idea, delete the post, but if u think its worthwhile, post ur thoughts!!<br><br>|||

Re: A proposed idea!|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/10/01 at 21:10:17|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.166|Sounds fun! Of course, I always have problems with figuring out what to do for someone whenever I've been involved with a secret Santa type of deal...I could draw that person's characterm but if it was someone who doesn't have a character that would be a problem...drawing is about the only thing I can do. &nbsp;Anyway, how would you do it anyway? How would you send this stuff to the person without them knowing who it's from?|||

Everyone gets a partener, <br><br>Example:<br><br>I had Whitefin as a partener and id send her stuff, but, say arkon had me as his partener, hed send me stuff, but i wouldnt know who sent it to me.<br><br>Now, about your question, id suggest we made a hotmail account and every1 would know the password, then we could send stuff in there.........*:lightbulb: appears over trellia head* or better yet, would could make an account on the forum that we could all access, and have one post where we could check for presents.....or just IM them to them<br><br>andd.....lesse, some ideas for &quot;presents&quot;<br>1. drawings<br>2. banners<br>3. Simple webpages (just make one webpage and show it just to them that may have some cool stuff in it)<br>4.and....er.....um, canna think anymore....you guys post some ideas! ^_^<br><br>okay hope that explained a bit :)<br>|||
