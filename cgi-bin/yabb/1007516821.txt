MP3 trouble|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/04/01 at 18:47:01|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.204.69|Are those MP3's supposed to take an hour and a half to two hours and fifteen minutes to download? Or is my computer just slow?<br><br>Well Yahoo's player sucks anyhow. &nbsp;It makes everything else slow down whenever I play music on it, but not if I just have it open w/o playing anything. But it's all I have since I got rid of Napster after it died. &nbsp;Now I can't even find MP3's anywhere. At least I can't find any good sites...either I can't figure out how to get to the MP3's, or they have a very poor selection and none of the songs that I look for.<br><br>Okay, that's enough of my griping. &nbsp;Erm...all I want is an answer to the question at the top, or perhaps some suggestions of where I can get MP3's and/or a better player...||

Yeah.<br><br>So anyway, I dunno, I have cable and the songs always downloaded in like a half a minute or so for me. Yeh. It rocks. Join the club.<br>||
Re: MP3 trouble|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/07/01 at 19:33:31|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.197.189|I currently have AOL and they were supposed to come out with something similar to DSL (but it's been a while so I dunno) and we were planning on getting that. &nbsp;I'd love to have something like that, as long as I could still communicate w/ my AOL buddies.<br><br>Yeah, now that I remember, even on Napster MP3's usually took a half hour to an hour to dl, but never 2 hours unless it was a really long song. &nbsp;I miss Napster. &nbsp;I wish it wouldn't have died. &nbsp;Stupid record companies...||
Re: MP3 trouble|Alastor|Al@Arkonviox.com|12/07/01 at 22:54:25|Alastor|xx|0|64.210.248.135|tis the sad truth of MP3's, they are MASSIVE files, and can take quite awile to download, but then again, I've spent 14 hours on one MPEG file before...so that time isn't bad. <br><br>Um, for the lack of a decent MP3 player, I would download winamp (just AOL search for it), or something else. The Windows Media Player is fine, if you don't have it (???) you can download it from Microsoft.<br><br>I personally recomend a download accelerator with AOL (i have it too). Try GetRight. It works best for me. <br><br>AOL can be used with DSL, but you have to pay a bunch more! They will send you the modem, but you pay around $50 a month! (ack!)<br><br>To change what plays your MP3 files (delphi), right-click on the file, and hit properties. Hopefully there is a button that you can use to change what it opens with, hit it, and change it to the mp3 player of your choice (I use the Windows ME Media Player, its works best for me). Make sure you have hit &quot;always open with this&quot; or something like that! <br>Hope that helps ya! If you already knew this, sorry! =)<br>|NS|12/07/01 at 22:58:48|Alastor

Re: MP3 trouble|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/09/01 at 13:40:49|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.173|That's what it is, the equalizer. Well, I dunno. &nbsp;Midis are fine, and so are MP3's except they don't sound as good. &nbsp;But whenever I play a CD with Winamp, whenever a new song starts, it chanegs the volume settings so that it sounds off and it just doesn't sound right. It has to do with the balance, but I can't remember exactly which thing it changes. &nbsp;But I have to change it back everytime it starts a new song. &nbsp;That's only when I play CD's with it, tho. But MP3's still don't sound as good as they did with Napster and Yahoo Player. &nbsp;The Yahoo Player would be great if it didn't make everything slow.||
