Looks nice and fits the theme a little better.  Who did the logo at the header? Its a nice montage.<br><br>One thing that might be a problem is that your CSS A:link color is very close to your table background colors, so certian links tend to blend in. they'd be better as #EEEEEE or simlar.<br><br>||12/19/01 at 19:25:59|Shadow

That is if you're going to stick with YaBB. If you're not, let be recomend [url=http://www.ikonboard.com/]Ikonboard[/url] or [url=htp://www.vbulletin.com/]vBulletin[/url]<br><br>vBulletin isn't free, but its definitly more powerful than most of the boards out there, ikon is a close second, and is free.||12/20/01 at 10:21:41|Shadow
