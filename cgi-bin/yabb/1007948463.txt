This topic is important to every one of you....|Histronic|john__cool@hotmail.com|12/09/01 at 18:41:03|Histronic|xx|0|209.242.238.88|Well, important, but not totally important :P<br><br>As you've probably heard, Arkon's been kicking around the idea of making a redesign for this site. &nbsp;Now lets surprise him for when he gets back. &nbsp;What would you do if you had to redesign the site? &nbsp;Would you add more Ecco pictures? &nbsp;Frames? &nbsp;More Stone in Time pictures?<br><br>Personally, I've found that I find light colors more pleasing than dark ones, namely black. &nbsp;Arkon has managed ot make the colors work, but I bet it would be better if it was brighter. &nbsp;And the layout could use a change too.... &nbsp;Not to say that the current layout isn't excellent, but as I've stated before, so many months ago before i left, it looks like Earthclan Arkonviox.com had a front end collision with the Undercaves and got stuck to it. &nbsp;Its not quite as cool as a past designs, namely Arkonviox Earthclan, powered by enigma advance :P &nbsp;That was my favorite, with the info down the middle and the navigation bars down either side. &nbsp;Plus the background kicked ass. &nbsp;For those who dont remember, you can find the background in the wallpaper section, aptly named Earthclan.<br><br>What do you think? &nbsp;To tell you the truth I expect all of our non lurking/alive/sober members to reply so.... reply dammit! &nbsp;This concerns you!||

A lighter background certainly wouldn't hurt. Uh, the navagation doesn't bother me too much, but a color scheme change is possibly overdue.||

Blues, purples, greens and the like would work best, anything with an aquatic feel. Keeping the cool animated gif's in the BG would be neat with a watery background. But that's just this artist's opinion... &nbsp;;D||

Good idea? I think the layout is good as it is...you don't really need to change it. I can help with the new design ;D||
Re: This topic is important to every one of you...|Friecco|vortex@winning.com|12/10/01 at 05:38:33|Friecco|xx|0|203.97.2.243|I could contribute &quot;New Border&quot; type, I guess. I'll come up with something else too. ;D||

I agree with the others who've mentioned the navigation/layout could use a change. This site is getting so frickin huge with information and what not, that the list of sections is really getting too long. I too liked the layout of the ol' Enigma Advance where the sections appeared on both sides of the home page. That looked nice. I also agree with changing the color scheme...and as Arkon's said about changing the look to more of an Ecco: Defender look...I think that's an excellent idea! However, the theme that's used now, could be in with the customizable features to change the theme to your personal preference. Arkon used to have that actually Fargal...but I'm not quite sure why he removed it...but yeah, it's a cool feature I think Arkon should bring back... ;D ...and, that's my thoughts on the matter!||

Could we pull this off before he gets back?||
Re: This topic is important to every one of you...|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/10/01 at 19:30:17|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.31|Oh yeah, and keep the floating critters in the background, that's really cool. &nbsp;It was the first thing that caught my eye when I first saw this site. &nbsp;But there should be some more, like add Trellia as right now there's only the &quot;flying V&quot; thing and I just think there should be one with just Trellia or one of those dolphins of the future.||

Re: This topic is important to every one of you...|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/11/01 at 18:41:58|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.56|Well I just think it gets old looking at the same thing all the time. But that's just my opinion. I just remembered about this one site that everytime you visit it, the frames change randomly. &nbsp;Except that you have to close the whole site and then open it again in order for it to change, so it doesn't do it everytime you go to another section. &nbsp;So maybe something like that would be good. &nbsp;Or if you could change it how you want like some of you were saying, that sounds cool too, and then when I got tired of one scheme I could change it. &nbsp;The text wouldn't be hard to read if it was a color that works with the background, especially if it contrasts--who says text has to be black all the time? ||
