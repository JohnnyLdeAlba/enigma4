Ecco News|dolphingirl|dolphingirl@arkonviox.com|12/06/01 at 14:26:31|dolphingirl|xx|0|63.206.170.252|Okay...I'm sure you all have read the recent entry in the News section right...?!?...I mean you all are Ecco fans...right?!?...heh, well if by chance you haven't, ya'd better go to the [url=http://www.arkonviox.com/cgi-bin/fnu102/news.cgi?news=8]NEWS[/url] section right this minute! Or you won't understand my post...hehe!<br><br>Okay, well, what the hell?!? How is it that Europe rates getting the release of the PS2 Ecco: DotF in Jan. or Feb...but as far as the US version, it's &quot;...release hasn't been confirmed yet&quot;...uhm...excuse me, but I want it dammit! All I can say is it had better come out over here soon... or... or..... or else........:mad2::angry::mad::mad3:<br><br>Actually, I have a question. Will the Gameshark convert the UK's PAL version of the game over to our US' NTSC...? Anyway, sorry for the venting...just couldn't help it.||

Besides, the 'problems' they addressed in the port aren't even real problems. The game wasn't too vague. And the clues never really helped, anyway.||

Or, have you not read it yet...[i]*ehem*[/i]...I don't care, even if it didn't have any new changes...I'd still get it. I guess that's what makes someone a die-hard fan of Ecco! There's no way I'd [i]not[/i] get an Ecco game out there for a system I've got...so...:tongue:...hehhe... ;)||
Re: Ecco News|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|12/06/01 at 15:01:59|Delphi|xx|0|139.142.157.226|I have read it, and yes, it will be basically the same except it'll include 'goodies'. Um... well, I guess I'm not die hard. Oh well. &nbsp;;D||

Re: Ecco News|Histronic|john__cool@hotmail.com|12/07/01 at 15:49:14|Histronic|xx|0|209.242.238.46|I dunno.... its my personal belief that ecco music isnt exactly something you listen to when not playing the game....||

However, I could see why some might not like it...it's all a matter of personal preference I guess. So, has anyone got an answer for me? Can you play a UK port on a US system...do you have to have a Gameshark...and do they work like that?||
