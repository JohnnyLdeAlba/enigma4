I finally got off my ass...|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/31/02 at 06:40:06|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.25.120|made a sub page to go with my Whitefin Trilogy :) Its soon to be finished and up. The main point of this topic is. I made a profile on Princess Thiranakaga (Fear Whitefin's real Atlantean name) and i'd like people to be able to see it and learn a bit more on her past beginings in a way. Its kinda light in a way, because it has no other profiles that it's linked to :D but once its finished - it'll have links to go directly to the profiles of her parents and shit. Mwaha, read or die.<br><br>http://arkonviox.com/user/cityofatlantis/thiranakaga.html<br><br>What do you think? :)<br><br>If you'd like to view the subsite for my books, you can see it at <br>http://arkonviox.com/user/cityofatlantis/index3.html<br>The only links working there at the moment are - Why Atlantis and the Home button :D. <br><br>Enjoy. *crawls off to attempt what humans call - sleep*||01/31/02 at 06:41:23|Whitefin

A spelling mistake I found - you had &quot;week&quot; instead of &quot;weak.&quot; &nbsp;Also, you had two sentences that you could have combined into one:<br><br>Unlike other Atlantean people, Thiranakaga has incredible pale white skin. Along with long black hair, and deep amethyst eyes. The natural marking of Princess is apon her left cheek. Always wears a Glyph Shard around her neck. <br><br>Maybe you should put instead:<br><br>Unlike other Atlantean people, Thiranakaga has incredible pale white skin, along with long black hair, and deep amethyst eyes. &nbsp;The natural marking of Princess is apon her left cheek, and she always wears a Glyph Shard around her neck. <br><br>Better? See, I told you I was a stickler for English. ;)||
