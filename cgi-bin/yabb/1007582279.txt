Earth Clan Members Counsil, now in session...|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|12/05/01 at 12:57:57|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.7.80|This is for anyone who wants to get involved and see whats up...<br><br>Something big may begin in the Ecco community soon. I been keeping on the downlow but I think its time to tell my elite members about it first...<br><br>For several weeks i noticed Psysonics site in my affiliate list site has been dying off...getting less then 10 visitors a day...<br><br>I been watching this for a long time cause even though we are bitter enemys that site must live...we need more ecco sites...but i encourage all my members not to pay that place a visit...but your free to do what you want...<br><br>Anyhow he made a post called &quot;whoohoo! the taste of deadness is in the air ^^;;, don't you smell it too?&quot; <br><br>explaining that his sites ran dead and that hes been to busy to work on it...thats when i knew hes given up...<br><br>so i made it my purpose to post there and get it rolling again and sure enough memebers who came from the ex undercaves popped up...people who hate me and began posting...<br><br>then he made a big update about it heres the article posted on my website....<br><br>http://www.arkonviox.com/objects/coharkonarticle.html<br><br>I also found out blackfin may be joining him or planning a new Ecco website sometime soon...the problem is he left the ecco community cause he hates everyone and thinks they are all my personal suckups/slaves...<br><br>whorse of all the people of that site make it apparent that i stole blackfins work when he gave it to me...but i dont need his guides to keep this site going...i just want them there cause i know they will help people...plus i plan on designing my own guides anyways...<br><br>after seeing that both blackfin and psysonic are so bitter i called blackfin on the telephone which only lasted a minute on my call card...<br><br>today where gonna have hopefully a metting to talk about this in a chat i cant tell anybody about...it may be tonight or tomarrow...<br><br>I just want everyone to know i didnt force anyone here...and i didnt close the udnercaves for my ego pride to make my site better..i closed it cause people like psysonic liked to spam the board trying to tell people how i suck and alot of people there hated me and left. <br><br>after that i was bitter from all of it...why keep a site going where people think im just messing up blackfins work? i decided to continue my site and cose the udnercaves...keeping it open would cost money i dont need to waste...<br><br>the site was free but expiring...meaning the free cost wasnt gonna last and id have to host it myself and pay for a new domain name...like ecco-the-dolphin.org or undercaves.com<br><br>but instead i rememebred he gave me the site blackfin did...and i decided to use what was from there and put it here...bringing the undercaves back to life withen arkonviox.com...<br><br>the first couple of weeks was very tough...i wanted everyone to be happy and forget the past...but now its come apparent...and i need to work out the differences with the founder himself blackfin...<br><br>since this topic is withen earth clan and is planned to stay here i dont want it decussed anywhere else...i want to keep this on the downlow since this community doesnt need the old drama again...i want everything to be right...and stay that way...but with psysonic being bitter along with blackfin...i cant achieve peace...thats what caused arkonviox.com to go against the udnercaves and i dont want history to repeat...psysonics taking the role of mine and wants to destroy me...i on the other hand dont want any wars on the community...<br><br>i should have not helped him and i should have not went to his site in his forum...that was a msitake and now hes bitter and brought blackfin into this...<br><br>now its the time to stop this..and only one person can speak out and hopefully end this...||

December, 2001 (PsySonic):<br>I've made some major deceptions concerning the connection between this site and Arkonviox' one. It's majorly about disconnecting this one and to talk about the main reason... Arkonviox' site is simply crap, offensive and lead by an ultimate retard. But I want to explain everything a little more in a larger article.<br>I just want to make clear here again that I banned Arkonviox from the interactive parts of this website and he won't have a chance to enter any new installations. I have him on my ignore list, meaning I won't hear anything from him ever again. And I also want you to never mention that name on this site again. I will delete it if I read it again, anyway. And for those of you who never heard about him, just be glad about it and don't try to find out about him. I will never enter that cursed site again, it's crap anyway. And I don't care about what will evolve from this on his site, too.<br>Anyway, sorry about the lack of updates. I think, now that my independence from the monster is achieved I will be able to do some more updates very soon again! This is of no offense, this is just an attempt to become free from the clutches of a monster. I want everybody to have fun on my website, but this cannot be achieved when the webmaster is rather dependent from a different demonic place, in which way ever.<br>Site update for today: The story of an Ecco game by one of the greatest Ecco fans ever - Blackfin! Located in the Never Finished Games Section as well as the Fan Fiction section!<br><br>i dunno if ur site banned or forum banned, anyway, ill just post it up here fer other earth clan members to see...<br><br>but im glad you got to at least to talk to blackfin, and im glad yoyo was wiit cha too ^~<br><br>man, has anyone noticed how much our community is like a well planned out soap opera? :lol: we could make millions off the stories of stuff that happend here! ;)<br>||12/05/01 at 17:19:05|Trellia
