Hi there!!!|FargalEX|fargalextreme@hotmail.com|10/04/01 at 14:44:05|FargalEX|xx|0|62.252.64.5|Hi all!!! :D<br>This is [glow=red,2,300]FargalEX[/glow] speaking, all the way from England! The story to how I found this site? Well...<br>I found it in a search engine, and boy was I happy! I used Black Fin's marvellous guide to complete the &quot;Lair Of Evil&quot; in Ecco: Defender Of The Future, and have now completed the game. Thank you, Black Fin! I hope I enjoy my stay here...|||
