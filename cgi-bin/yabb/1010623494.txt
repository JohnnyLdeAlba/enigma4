Alternate Opening Titles for TOT?|Kitnee|sailorgalaxy@snip.net|01/09/02 at 17:44:54|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.121.38|Hey, Angelfin, I was taking a look at your site (which rocks, by the way &nbsp;;D), and I noticed something different - the screenshot you have of TOT's title screen is different than my game's version. &nbsp;Your screenshot has a &quot;II&quot; under Ecco's name, but mine just says &quot;Ecco: The Tides of Time.&quot; &nbsp;Is this a screenshot of the Japanese or Game Gear versions of the game, or is my game just different? o_o;;||
Re: Alternate Opening Titles for TOT?|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|01/09/02 at 18:51:39|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.30.96|Its a shot from the Japanese version of Ecco2. I also have the translated version of it that has the same features as the Jap. I also have the Japanese version of Ecco 1 which has the unused level in the English Versions - The Stomach. ^_^ I hope that answers your question.||
