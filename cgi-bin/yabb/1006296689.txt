This was the first year that I had to spend it away from my family. Yea yea...when yer young, you'd love to get away from your family. But just you guys wait. When you get older...you seem to grow fonder of them. At least I was fortunate enough to be invited over to some friends' house...so I was able to at least have a good dinner! Anyway, I hope all your guys' holiday went well... :) ||
