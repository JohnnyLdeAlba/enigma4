Alot of the people who are in it now are there for there big accomplishments. I will have more room for members as soon as we get more new members. So your gonna have to wait. most of you who been here are on a waiting list but you wont be in until someone new comes in and replaces you. Just stick around.

Of course, it had probably been around a while by the time I joined the forum.  I was here for...I dunno, maybe about a coule months when I got into the Clan.  But that doesn't seem like a long enough time.  And I have no idea what I might have possibly accomplished.  And so my question remains unanswered.  When I first got in I asked the same thing: why am I in?  And nobody would answer me.  I was told several times what it means to be in the Earth Clan.  But nobody would tell me why I was there.  Is it some big secret?  I demand to know the exact reason why I am worthy to be in the Earth Clan!||
