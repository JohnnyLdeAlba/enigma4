Asignment: Week 1|Crestoe|Crestoe@arkonviox.com|01/30/02 at 01:34:20|Crestoe|xx|0|63.253.226.67|For both my lackeys, i asign to you simple tasks. Complete as soon as you can, and your off to play till next week. Then we'll start shortining the time between the next asignments until i dont have to give you anymore. :P<br><br>When you've finished them, report back here with the information, yada yada.<br><br>Week 1 asignments:<br><br>Histronic - 2 Jobs: <br>1. Delete Any Really stupid topic last posted in by Kitnee.<br>2. Lock One Old or Credibly stupid topic, give a reason you think is good for it.<br><br>When you're done, report back here with the topics you have deleted and locked. Try not to complete them all in 1 day unless totally necessary. Remember, the lower minded ones see many locked and/or deleted topics as an unwelcoming to the forums. <br><br>Whitefin - 2 Jobs:<br>1. Find me a god damn decent 3rd Lackey. <br>The catch to this is they cant be a firend or someone close to you. ;)<br>Its a week long task, so you'll have plenty of time to look. If you cant find someone good, the job will be passed to Histronic. After that, the next week asignments work load for you will be enlarged and Histronic gets the week off. So get crackin!<br>2. Need more help, laying down some rules. I know you're busy on your site this wek, so your work load is a light one. You've made good rules before, lay them before me so i can add them to my rules list in the general. Anything i havent already added.<br><br>The rules you make will later be put on an agreement before registering on this forum for newbies. This way, if they didnt read the rules the first time, i, and the rest of the admins, have better reason to ban them.<br><br>Your rules are 5 minimium. No less.<br><br>[center][i]-Assignment Rules-[/i]<br>If you can not for some reason finish your tasks (With the exception of illness, offline and other outside activities) Your job will be passed to the next person. When that happens, that person inwhich recieves your jobs will not have any to do the next week and will be free off. And you will be subject to a double work load for that week. So not finishing them is a no win sittuation. That rule goes for each and all of you.<br><br>In addition, if you continue to delay your work for your other fellow lackey or because of outside activities (Thats when its too many times, because at that point your considered completely not doing your job) you will be stripped of your powers and banned FOREVER as a lackey. You will also be stripped of special powers as a normal poster, unless the case was outside activities. The fact remains you will never get the chance to be a Lackey again. No win sittuation.<br><br>If for some reason ALL of you cant do your jobs, they will be delayed for the next week. So thats not problem at all.<br><br>Remember, bieng Lackeys, you are making a trip for being a future admin at this site. But only one of you. This is not a competition though, and i can not tell you when i will be asigning one of you as admins. Your in Lackey kindergarden my darlings, you have quite the long way to go.<br><br>So work hard and prove yerselves as damn good lackeys, Yer actions will be monitored by the other admins, including Arkonviox.[/center]<br><br>And with that said, Lets roll on out.||01/30/02 at 01:53:41|Crestoe

Mr>Crestoe - thank you kindly for a light load this week :) I'll be sure to get mah website stuff done soon so I can get my ass into a better gear and not leave Lackey Pals to do the lot *pats Hist* For finding another lackey - i'll keep an eye out on people and narrow my list day by day to whom behaves the best - is on frequently and won't abuse the lackey privleges. As for the rules - I'll get back to you on that :) *runs off to browse forums and get ideas for rules*||

I thought about going to look on the second page, but that would bring an old topic up and no one wants that.||
Re: Asignment: Week 1|Histronic|john__cool@hotmail.com|02/03/02 at 08:19:30|Histronic|xx|0|209.242.238.57|Aw here it is... i locked that post by dolphingirl called newsboard.  It has its reason and everything.  The only that kitnee last posted stupidly in was posted by arkonviox, about the poll feature, so i stayed away from that one.  I was gonna get rid of tethys revamped, but that seemed a little too popular.  So what the hell can i do?||
