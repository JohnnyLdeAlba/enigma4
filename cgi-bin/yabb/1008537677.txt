Project Forgotten|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|12/16/01 at 14:21:16|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.6.45|I have already begun Project Forgotten, It will be released on chrismas, which will be the redesign of the intire Arkonviox.com website!<br><br>As the days progress i will tell you what it involves. Just know the change in the forum is just the begining. Later on i will present a screenshot... so you can see how this site will forever be changed.<br><br>Arkonviox.com isn't just another Ecco website...it's thee Ecco the Dolphin website. That means theres a center of everything...were the center of all Ecco information! <br><br>I know its gonna be wierd to imagine. For a long time we focused on being a site based on the Arkonviox world of Ecco, but now were jumping into the full fledged world of Ecco.<br><br>Stay tunned to find out what this means...||

Re: Project Forgotten|FargalEX|fargalextreme@hotmail.com|12/17/01 at 10:56:58|FargalEX|xx|0|62.252.64.6|Hmmm...In my opinion the colour scheme looks...I dunno...bad...<br><br>The blues are greyish and the links don't change colour once you've clicked on them (very confusing), Those blue separotors look crap also but I'm sure that it'll all look much better once you have a background ;D||
