That Vortex King is just freaky - but in a good way of course - you did an awesome job on it. And the other one?!? Wow...and I mean wow...I just think your artistic touch to that one was frickin awesome man. I love the way the 3 different forms fade into each other...looks hella cool! I know you've been wanting a pic of all 3 forms together, and well...now ya got it! And a damn good one too! You keep up the great work Arkon...they're really really good...:thumbup:||
Re: The Vortex King...|Aziel|zau_mx@yahoo.com|11/21/01 at 02:16:46|Aziel|xx|0|216.226.194.6|Arkon- Thanks for clearing that up. Not to mention Friecco of course. I hope we get to read the fic soon and who knows, maybe we might even get to play it someday ;D||
