Tethys Revamped|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/25/02 at 21:28:58|Tethys|exclamation|0|205.188.197.161|Well, not only have I completely changed Tethys' appearance, I've changed everything about her.  But I'll explain that later.  The new look I gave her is actually more like how I originally wanted her to look, but I couldn't figure out how to do it.  But I did a good job this time.<br>I've just begun to work on my shading, and I think I did a good job here. It's actually Prismacolors, but I smart blurred it with Photoshop so now it looks kinda like oil pastels or something. It's a neat effect.<br>Altho it's on Tripod, the link should work.<br><br>http://tiarra2.tripod.com/teth_revamp.jpg<br><br>Oh yeah, I had to curl the tail under to fit it on the paper, because she's quite long, and I didn't want to draw it any smaller.  But I suppose it doesn't look too weird like that.||

Re: Tethys Revamped|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/26/02 at 18:15:13|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.49|Grrrrr....I wrote this big long thing and I was almost finished when AOL goes and loses connection.  No mater how many new versions they come out with, they can't come up with something that loses connection constantly.<br><br>Well, anyway, thanks for the compliments!  Tho I don't know how Whitfin knew I had it on Side 7.  I wasn't aware anyone here even knew I had an account there.  Well, I wanted to post the image off of Side 7, but I didn't know how to link directly to the image file itself and not the archive.  Oh, and Arkon, that link you posted doesn't work.  The thumbnail shows up properly, but that may only be because...well I actually don't have it on my hard drive, it's on a disc which isn't in the drive, so it must have to do with the fact that I've veiwed the image on my browser.  Well, anyway, I'm glad you all like it.<br><br>So, anyway, here's what I was trying to say before losing connection about the new Tethys.  I don't have everything worked out, but I have the basics.  I actually made up much of this right when I was typing this the first time, and it was a better idea than what I had before.<br><br>This is what I just made up. Tethys is one of the Gaurdians of the Seven Seas.  At first she was going to be the one gaurdian of the seas, but I was also thinking maybe there should be more.  So there's one Gaurdian for each of the seven Oceans, and they all look different.  I have to come up with all of them, but if someone wants to do one that's fine with me as long as you ask.  Then I won't have as much work.  ;)  <br><br>Now, these Gaurdians didn't always exsist.  I'm sure you've all heard of Pangaea (I may have spelled that wrong).  Well, obviously, there was also one big ocean at the time, and it was called Panthalassa (I probably spelled that wrong, too).  So, at that time, there was one...entity of some sort.  An elemental or something like that, I suppose. Anyway, so when the continents seperated and the seven oceans were formed, it "splitted", so to speak, into the seven different Gaurdians.  So, that's the basic idea.<br><br>I wanted to somehow use the way I originally drew Tethys as like a secondary form or something, but I'm not sure how I want to do it.  I thought maybe she could use that form to blend in with dolphins, not that she wouldn't stand out anyway with those colors, but I'm not sure I really like that idea.||

The new Tethys is based off of Plesiosaurs (the kind with the really long neck is called an Elasmosaurus, which is a kind of Plesiosaur).  But I made the head more dolphin-like.  Sort of, anyway.  I actually used the Pistosaurus for the body, which is actually a type of Nothosaur (a different order of marine reptiles).  And...something else for the neck, I can't remember which one.  Then I used the Elasmosaurus' flippers, and for the tail, I looked at Plotosaurus (which is a Mososaur) because it has the long tail.  Of course, there was never a creature with a tail like Tethys', which is almost exactly like the tail she originally had.<br><br>I'm very glad that I found my old dinosaur book!  That's where I got all those references.  It lists four different aquatic reptiles: Placodonts, Nothosaurs, Ichthyosaurs, and Plesiosaurs.  Mososaurs are listed as "lizard relatives" but all the ones in this book were aquatic.<br><br>Hey, Eao, thanks for all the comments you left on my Side 7 archive!  ;)  I get an automatic e-mail whenever someone leaves a comment.  You know, people almost never leave comments on that site.  I dunno why.||

Re: Tethys Revamped|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/27/02 at 10:32:58|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|That's not weird, 'Zairo. I used to be totally obsessed with dinosaurs and Jurassic Park... even when I was like seven I could name all those really weird, complex dinosaur names... kinda funny, actually. I wanted to be a paleontologist (er... spelling?) just so I could work with dinosaur bones. Now I still find 'em really interesting, but more so the raptors than anything else. Also thanks to Jurassic Park ;) ||
Re: Tethys Revamped|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|01/28/02 at 18:44:40|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.201.71|Thanks Shadow!<br><br>Kitnee, remember I said that url wouldn't work.  I tried to use it, but the picture didn't show up.  <br><br>Thanks, Doom!  Just go to my fanart section in this site and you will be able to see the only two pictures I ever did of Tethys before changing her appearance.<br><br>Oh, and I messed up when I was talking about how I edited the picture in Photoshop. Sure, I used smart blur, like I have been doing to all my color-pencil pics and pencil drawings lately, but that wasn't what made it look oil-crayon-ish.  I forgot one filter that I used: palette knife.  That's what made it look like that.  On most of my pictures it makes it look like crap so I don't use it.  But every once in a while it works beautifully, like in this case.  I don't know what it is, it must have something to do with how it's colored.  I just wanted to fix that just so people don't start trying to get that effect with smart blur instead of palette knife.<br><br>I was really into dinosaurs waaayyy before Jurassic Park came out, and that's why I was so excited about that movie. I've always loved Sauropods the best (the ones with long necks, like Apatasaurus and Brachiosaurus).  But that's a bit off subject here.  I was just saying which ones I looked at in my book to draw Tethys...alng with a tad of additional information, but that's beside the point.||
