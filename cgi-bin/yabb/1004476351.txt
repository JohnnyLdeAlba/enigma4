Re: Favourite Films|Shadow|dolphin@dolphinparadise.net|12/05/01 at 02:00:23|Shadow|xx|0|165.121.121.14|Hrm, films. Lets see, anything by Stanley Kubrick is good. Full Metal Jacket was particularly so.<br><br>Enemy at the Gates was good, though I could have gone without the whole love scene subplot, it detracted from the pure mental competition between the major and zaitsev, and reminded me way too much of Titanic.<br><br>Deleverance, also good, starts out kinda corny and gets progressivly more psychotic.<br><br>Deer Hunter. Good but very long. If you can get past the parts of the film that really don't add anything to the story, its quite good.<br><br>Thats all I can think of that I've seen reciently.
