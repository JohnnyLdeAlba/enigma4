Friecco's game to end all games... ;D|Friecco|vortex@winning.com|11/24/01 at 04:00:21|Friecco|xx|0|203.97.2.243|OK, here's how to play: One person gets to say a certain &quot;line&quot; from a certain &quot;Video Game&quot; (any video game, any console), while the &quot;other&quot; person gets to guess which game, the line is from. If that &quot;other&quot; person gives the correct answer, it's that persons turn to make another line from another (or the same) video game.<br><br>I start first: ;D<br><br>[b] Uh.... Caught a damn cold, I hate Alasca...... Boy-oh-boy, that woman is built all right.....[/b]||

I haven't played a lot of games, I just don't play video games much anymore, but I used to play them all the time.<br><br>So does this mean I get to say the next one, even tho I didn't get it exactly right? You know, I was gonna say Zero Wing, and I dunno why I didn't. &nbsp;Oh well...<br><br>Hmm...I don't know quotes...I can only think of one and I'm not sure if I'm remembering it exactly right. &nbsp;It shouldn't be hard to figure out anyway as long as you've played the game, and I think it was popular enough, and it's probably the best known line in the game.<br><br>&quot;Keeping something from me is the seventh most dangerous thing in this world!&quot;||

There's two possible reasons why no one is responding--either everyone has lost interest in this game... or NO ONE here has played Phantasy Star IV! Which I find really hard to beleive--I was certain that was a popular game--there's enough websites on it. Well, at least the series. Oh, I guess it's possible no one remembered that quote, but I've seen it repeated enough times in the Phantasy Star websites I figured it was a popular quote from the game and that people would know it, especially since, in my opinion, it's a quite memorable quote. &nbsp;Well...maybe no one is interested in this game anymore since no one even tried. And when I finally get a chance at it!! &nbsp;&gt;:(<br>Oh well..||

It's not the end of the world...so the topic hasn't really picked up yet...and no one could guess your quote. I didn't answer, cus I didn't know...and I've not played Phantasy Star IV...sorry!
