My circumstances were a bit more than just the holiday though, I've been incredibly sick, and I can't seem to shake it. I'm doing a bit better finally, so ya should see me around a lil more...that is if ya even noticed I was gone...heheh. Anyway, can't wait to see you back FargalEX!||

But now there's one BIG problem... :(<br>I don't have internet access anymore!!! I'm using my friend's computer at the mo. I got a new computer for christmas (BRILLIANT!!!) but there's no connection so I'll have to wait till I get a new phone line installed until I can see you all again.||

I lost my internet for four months because my phone bill doubled and i ended up paying 2000.00 to get it paid off. <br><br>2001 relly sucked for me. No girlfriend, had to pay large phone bill. But on the upside i dominated the Ecco community and defeated the Ultimate Ecco the Dolphin website.<br><br>Sad to say though its a new year filled with new goals and all thats left is keeping this place strone since its thee only Ecco the Dolphin website/community. How long can i keep it up? thats a thought i hope to never think about.||
