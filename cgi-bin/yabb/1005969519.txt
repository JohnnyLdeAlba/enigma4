A Stupid Question, Maybe...|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|11/16/01 at 20:58:39|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.223.143|Hm. I've wondered if anyone else shares my opinion on this...<br><br>When I first played Tides of Time, I really wished that there had been some author who had written the novelization of our good old Ecco games. I even tried writing the Tides of Time myself. Granted, the storylines for the games (pardon me, anyone who disagrees) aren't exactly... well, riveting... but I think that like most authors who write novelizations of games/movies, SOMEONE could have spiced it up a little. Basically, I wanted (and still wouldn't mind having) the Ecco... er... Trilogy, I guess, in book form. As long as the cover art was good and they got a mildly skilled author (there are many bad ones out there, including me) to write them.<br><br>Anyone agree? Just a thought, y'know...||

There aren't many novels out there that have dolphins as the main characters. I have a hard time writing Ecco fanfic for that reason: that there just isn't much you can do to make a dolphin story all that interesting.||
