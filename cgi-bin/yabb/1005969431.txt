Trivia Game|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/16/01 at 20:57:11|Tethys|smiley|0|152.163.201.72|Kay, I got an idea for a game. We can take turns asking trivia questions. &nbsp;The deal is, someone will ask a question, about anything, and whoever is the first to answer it correctly gets to ask the next one. But the person who asked the question has to say who got it right.<br><br>Now just to make sure we don't get stuck with one question for a long time that no one can answer, heres the deal: If, say, 5 people attempt to answer the question and no one gets it right, then you have to give a hint, or if nobody attempts to answer within a week(to give people enough time), then you also have to give a hint. If nobody guesses after three hints (after 5 people or one week again), then you have to give the solutuion. &nbsp;If that happens, then anybody else can ask the next question. You can look up answers if you really want to take the time to do that...<br><br>So, I'll start with a really easy one to get the ball rolling (at least it should be easy):<br><br>In the original Ecco game, who created the time machine?||

Re: Trivia Game|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/20/01 at 20:00:13|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.201.47|I coulda sworn I posted another message here. Well, anyway, I'm not gonna try to answer the question as I have no clue. But I just want to point something out in case anyone missed it before--since Yogi didn't wait for me to confirm that he got the answer right. &nbsp;That's okay for that time b/c my question was one that anybody who ever played the game should know. I purposely made it easy. But from now on it'd be a good idea to wait until the person who asked the question confirms you got the answer right. Cuz what will happen is someone might think they have the right answer for sure when they really don't. Oh, and don't ask questions you don't know the answer to cuz...well, that would just be dumb. &nbsp;:P<br>Carry on. :)||
Re: Trivia Game|yogoat|ze_third_mas@hotmail.com|11/20/01 at 21:05:58|yogoat|xx|0|24.6.207.243|I deleted it so you wouldn't HAVE to say it. &nbsp;And this game is going nowhere, so maybe a new question will speed things up. &nbsp;I'll give the answer to Trellia, since she was the only person that answered. &nbsp;The answer is either <br><br>Francois Viette<br>OR<br>Nobody, algebra's always been there, someone just had to discover it. &nbsp;You can't invent it!||

Re: Trivia Game|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|11/21/01 at 21:58:50|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.176|o.o Um...okay. Maybe we should try to refrain from really hard questions like that. Well, someone come up with another question. Anyone. Or else I will ask something else.||

Re: Trivia Game|Tethys|iasoiedad@aol.com|12/01/01 at 20:07:56|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.204.57|DotF? No...that doesn't make any sense....I have no clue. &nbsp;<br><br>Oh, and btw you were supposed to wait for confirmation that you got the answer right on that last one. &nbsp;That's okay, but from now on you should wait even on the easy ones that everyone knows (or should know) just because it's good for consistancy. On harder questions (if there ever are any more questions) some people might think they got the answer right, and then if they started a new question w/o confirmation others wouldn't have a chance to answer it right...<br><br>Oh, and, if someone asks a question about what you asked, you can answer it, as long as it would point directly to the answer. For example: Where is this on the forum? ||
