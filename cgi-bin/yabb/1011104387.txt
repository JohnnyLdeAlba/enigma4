This is a [b]bad[/b] idea.<br>I had to dig up an old backup disk to find these, but here you go.<br><br><br>This is probably my oldest art, done sometime in 1995. Its spline modeled in Strata and rendered with medium radiosity. Time to complete this single frame: 7 hours.<br><br>[img]http://www.dolphinparadise.net/old/chromes.jpg[/img]<br><br><br>My first, last and only attempt at freehand drawing:<br><br>[img]http://www.dolphinparadise.net/old/bad.jpg[/img]<br><br>I cant imagine why I ever thought Bryce was cool. Guessing its a 1995 era scene. Same models as above. Rendering time was probably around 24 hours.<br><br>[img]http://www.dolphinparadise.net/old/yech.jpg[/img]<br><br><br>I did this in Painter 2 or 3 around the same time.<br><br>[img]http://www.dolphinparadise.net/old/chaos.jpg[/img]<br><br>||

Or my browser or whatever it is!  I could see the pictures, but then when I scroll up to take another look, they all dissappeared.  All except about three.  It's been doing that with other images on this forum.  <br><br>Anyway, Vantid those are really good.  Those dolphins are still better than I can draw them.<br><br>And Shadow, those are incredible.  Well, except for the freehand one.. But, still.<br><br>And Whitefin, most of those furries are pretty darn good in my opinion.<br><br>Of course you're all incredible artists now, except I'm not sure I've ever seen Shadow's art.<br><br>The rest all dissappeared before I could see them, because I scrolled up.  I'll have to look again.  And, Kitnee, I couldn't see yours at all. It acted like it was loading the images, but then nothing showed up but white.<br><br>I would post up some of my really old artwork.  But the only way to do it would be to upload them onto my Tripod account and then add links because images on Tripod won't show up here.  But, if I'm not going to display them on my site, and I won't, they will just take up room.  <br><br>I could add links to artwork on my archives at TA, tSf, and SHQ, but right now my browser won't display the websites correctly which means I have to restart AOL, but I gotta go in a sec anyway so I'll do it later.||

I don't understand what is the meaning of this!<br><br>Well, I dunno what the hell is wrong here because I still can't get these wesbites to work.  I can't see what the images are so I can't decide which ones I want to link to. OTHER websites work just fine!||

They workie now!! ;D<br>Kay, everything I didn't comment on--really good.  I'm serious.<br><br>Kitnee I finally got to see yours, too.  Not bad, actually.  Especially since alot of people couldn't even draw like that.  If that's your old art, than you must be pretty good by now.<br><br>And here I can finally post mine! Since they're not on Tripod, I figure they should work, but just in case I'll put URLs underneath.  They're all furries, since I din't do much else at the time.

And anyway, I don't have a good paint program, so all my stuff looks like it's been coloured by psychotic monkeys... but um... if I find anything sorta old i'll try to stick it up.||
