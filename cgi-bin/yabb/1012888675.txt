I'd be REAL pissed off if DOF wasn't released in North America. Frankly it wouldn't make much sense to release it only in the UK and Japan, I mean....wtf? Ecco's got a huge fan base in North America. It wouldn't make any sense not to want to realease it here, bad business sense anyway....*grumble*<br><br>*slinks off*||
