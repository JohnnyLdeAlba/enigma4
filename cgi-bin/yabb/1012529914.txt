New pic, By none of then the cold hearted bastard!|Crestoe|Crestoe@arkonviox.com|01/31/02 at 19:18:32|Crestoe|xx|0|63.253.7.92|<br>Thats right, I finally got to doing yet another dolphin related picture. This one isnt just a picture of the charicter, Its Crestoe in action in the end of a battlee with Dark Whale Orbiulous. <br><br>Using his long jaws to twist his head from Orbiulous's spine, like breaking his neck. Except the fact that Whales, expecially false orcas, dont have necks. o_o <br><br>http://arkonviox.com/tassartwork/img/crestoeanddarkwhale.jpg <br><br>Always did want to do a picture of Crestoe kicking ass. So here it finally is,this one taking 2 days to do working on it off and on. <br><br>That lump on the dark whale's head is his spine, just so you'll know.<br><br>Its not often i do any artwork becuz of lack of scanner, so enjoy this one till the next random piece. ||01/31/02 at 19:24:31|Crestoe
