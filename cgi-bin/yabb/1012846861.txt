Thats kinda weak if you ask me. If thats the case, then thats the likely origin of most of these people that have zero post count, but actually come around and login to read the board.<br><br>Arkon needs to confirm/deny if we're moving to being a closed community or not. I've seen site policy type posts to both effects.<br><br>Also, what exactally is Earth Clan's function? From the forum description, it would seem that part of EC's function is that of a Steering Committee, which makes decisions about broad goals and gives direction to such, but I don't see much activity to that effect||02/04/02 at 13:23:52|Shadow
