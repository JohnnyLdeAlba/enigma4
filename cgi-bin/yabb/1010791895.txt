A fan fic, perhaps?|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/11/02 at 16:31:35|Tidesinger|xx|0|213.122.227.207|Okay, I've been thinking about this for a while now, and the idea is growing on me. I really want to write a fan fic featuring everybody I know in this forum. I've wrote stories before, so this should be no biggie (Hell, I got a 120+ page story still in the works about me and my friends with magical powers). But what I do need is info. I need to know what other people on this site are like. <br>It is going to be the story of Tidesinger, Arkonviox, and the gang, plus the Vortex thrown in for good measure.<br>So, what's Arkon really like? I need to know everything about everyones personalities. My story is going to be set not in Mans nightmare or Dolphins nightmare, but in the bay from Eccos world. Plus I'll need a kool name for our pod.<br>I would also appreciate input from everyone about loads of stuff, so if you think it could be useful for my fic, then post it, even if it seems crap.||

She's an original Ecco character. &nbsp;All I can say is that she's one of Ecco's best friends. I could create a whole big storyline for her, but I'll need some time - when were you planning on starting the fic, Tidey?||

She has a flat dorsal fin that has a spike pretruding from its back* (See picture for details). Abnormally large fins that can be used for short burst of incredible speed - and a triton tail, with two whip like tentacles on them.<br>Personallity: Whitefin is anti-social, she usually fends for herself, but is willing to give her life to save those importaint to her. She doesn't speek much unless its to Arkon, Crestoe, or Trellia. She always stays to the back of the pod, and has had to survive the encounter of the first vortex, the second vortex, and the Foe - making her not have to think twice about killing another thing.<br><br>Emotions and moods you normally see her in: Silent, Loyal, Guardian, Secretive.<br><br>Profile Image: http://arkonviox.com/user/whitefin/art/2002-rebirth2.jpg||01/11/02 at 19:31:05|Whitefin

Re: A fan fic, perhaps?|Kitnee|sailorgalaxy@snip.net|01/11/02 at 17:21:56|EccoGirl|xx|0|209.204.65.199|Yeesh! This weekend? &nbsp;:o Well, Tidey, you drive a hard bargin, but here's what I could come up with, following Whitefin's example...<br><br>Full Name: Kitnee<br>Name she is known as: Kitnee (^^;; I don't think sea creatures [i]have[/i] last names...) <br>Sex: Female <br>Age: *depends on how old Ecco is, since she's the same age. I'm guessing...maybe 20 or 25?*<br>Appearance: Kitnee has been one of the world-famous Ecco the Dolphin's best friends for as long as she can remember. &nbsp;She, Ecco, and their other friend, Tara even went on a big quest, the search for the Big Blue! &nbsp;Kitnee is a normal-sized, female orca, with a whiteish-gray saddle patch that resembles a star.<br>Personallity: Kitnee is a happy-go-lucky kind of whale, but make her mad and she's ready to fight. &nbsp;Usually peaceful, docile, and benevolent, Kitnee will not think twice about risking her tail for another, especially a creature in turmoil. &nbsp;She has, fortunately, never had to do battle with the Vortexes or the Foe, but she has had the priveliage of meeting the mysterios Asterite. &nbsp;She was also one of the lucky sea creatures who helped build the Guardian. &nbsp;Kitnee is one of the Guardian Protectors who stands watch at the Gate of Atlantis, making sure no evil presence enters the sacred Guardian's Haven...<br>Emotions and moods you normally see her in: Bubbly, Loyal, Headstrong, and Hyper (:P)||

I'm sure that will turn out great!<br>I don't have to be in it, but seeing as how I love my new dolphin image thanks to Swifty, I'll give you a profile incase.<br>Alright...since I love the way Swifty drew me in her new pic, I'd like to be seen like that. A metalic like dolphin with a skull and cross bones on her forhead.<br>I can't tell you how much I like it Swift!!! Thank you!!!<br>So now...name: Doomtrain (just call me Train). Actually, I think I need a new better nick name. Somethinf relivent, but somthing better. Any suggestions?<br>Sex: Female, Age: ? Unknown I'll say.<br>Hmmm, I seem like more of a villian, but do whatever you want. My appearence (with the name and skulls and all) dosen't really seem to fit my personality, but you can alter me if it works better for you.

She is shaped closly to an everyday dolphin except her fins are much larger. She has a highly developed mind and she can move stuff with it. Her body is light and delicate since she flies just above the water, and will be killed if she goes down too deep in the water (its called water pressure people ^~)<br>Personallity: Trellia is an upper pod elder, she is very wise and a quick thinker. She is mostly left alone by others because of her status, but she is a good friend with other gaurdians such as the asterite and whitefin. She is a chosen one from the asterite and her ecco have had many an adventure together.<br><br>Emotions and moods you normally see her in: Calm, wise, content<br>||

Seafoam blue eyes and pale blue stars on her melon that are upside down, that form Dolphinus's constellation.<br>Personality: The shy one quite possibly in the group, more submissive than her her DNA partner. She lead a hard life, after the death of her pod she wanders the oceans. Calypso is rather strong, she is telepath and as well as in mind-reading. But her body is very weak and she can pass out or fall to the seafloor in pain without warning. She has low self-esteem and is constantly apologizing to everyone if she thought she done something wrong. She loves her friends dearly and can defend them with claws and fangs (it's an expression people) if she must.<br>||

Much larger as well.<br><br>As for Arkon, Alastor, Trellia and Rebirth Whitefin, I'll write you guys in later on. But I do need input from you guys.

That's just because of the way Arkon has programmed his site. Whether it's to be simpler in not having such a cluttered URL...or to not let the average person know the exact URL...I dunno. I think it has something to do with frames/no frames...then again, I'm not one of those computer smartie-pants...so, don't hold me to anything...heheh! Perhaps it's just something due to another thing he wants to have in place...I dunno, but if you're ever on a page  you want to know the exact URL for...(or if you're lets say, looking at a list of topics and want the URL to link to it)...right click in open space on the page (or the link that'll take you to the topic), then select "Properties" at the bottom of the list...within that information that pulls up, you will be able to view the exact URL of the page/link. So, here's a direct link to that topic you wanted to link people to... :) ...hope my explanation helped!<br><br>[url=http://www.arkonviox.com/cgi-bin/YaBB/YaBB.cgi?board=general;action=display;num=1012019339]Tethys Revamped[/url]||

But from Doomy's pic I can always refer to it. Did she put it up for you as well?????? Anyways, I'll add that in in a bit....<br>As for info, keep it coming. And I just thought that we could make a character profiles link or sumthin.... What ya think?||
