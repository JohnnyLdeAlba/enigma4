If not...then...uh...well never mind...hehe! It's been a while since I've played that game...I think it's about time for a second time through (or third - can't recall how many times I've played it)... ;D ...from beginning to end!||01/04/02 at 00:41:42|dolphingirl

Re: @_&lt;;; *rubs eyes*|Delphi|sailordelphi@hotmail.com|01/04/02 at 19:35:54|Delphi|xx|0|24.71.207.244|AGH! MASTER OF FORGOTTEN SKILLS! I hated that level, too! But... and I know someone's gonna wanna kill me for saying this... the level that made me go crazy with anger and rage and all sorts a' things...<br><br>Hanging Waters.<br><br>It was fun for a while. It's still gorgeous to look at and the music in it is so good I think I might try to midi-fy it. But... what else can I say about that level besides...<br><br>AFTER MONTHS OF BEING STUCK IN IT, IT TURNS INTO A GOD DAMNED NIGHTMARE!<br><br>I've never sworn so much at the TV, heard that &quot;Ecco's Dead&quot; death riff so many times (since like Perils of the Coral Reef), or felt like bashing my head against the wall so much since playing that level! When I beat it, I literally danced around the living room...||

I dunno, the only levels I really love in that game are the ones in the Isle of Tranquility. Well, them and the levels with the Clans BESIDES Hanging Waters...||

Plus, at the end when there's about one panel of the shield left and it's all dark and the snakes are dead, that's when I just feel like outright killing something...it's ballistic with all those rocks flying around!||01/05/02 at 11:11:54|yogoat
