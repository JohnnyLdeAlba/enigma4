minor question about DOTF......|Friecco|vortex@winning.com|10/28/01 at 03:03:04|Friecco|xx|0|203.97.2.242|1. When the Dolphins/other creatures speak to you, do you actually hear/understand what they say, or is there still the text line so you can read what they say (or both)?<br><br>2. When you ( let's say) die in Ecco: DOTF, is there such thing as (shudder) &quot;GAME OVER&quot;, or, is there still the good ol' &quot;restart the level&quot;.|||

You hear a little noise (depending if it's a whale or dolphin) and some text ripples on to the screen. There isn't a separate screen where text is displayed (like on ecco 1+2), but rather the text is placed on to the actual game (as if it were paused).<br><br>2. Whenever you die, you are given the same message over and over (Ecco...you must continue on, it is your destiny...). You are given 10 seconds to press start, and if you press start you don't have to go to the begininng of the level, you start around the place you died, keeping all the stuff you collected. If you let the 10 seconds count down to zero, there is a little ovie clip (not fmv) where you become a constellation, then you go back to the main menu, where you can try the level again but you have to start from the begininng of the level instead.<br><br>Is that enough explanation??? ;D|||
