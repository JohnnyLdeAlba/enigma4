Fargal, I want to thank you for playing along the best with that topic of mine I created...it was so much fun seeing you contribute to it all. I think that makes you the winner for that topic! ;) ...congrats! But, maybe some things are better left to remember (for a little while anyway)...but if you feel the need to start one up again...heheh...go right ahead - it's fine by me! Anyway, I'm sorry to hear about the screw up Arkon...hopefully it won't do it again...eh....||
