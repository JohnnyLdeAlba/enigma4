Re: COOK BOOK UP?|Rebirth Whitefin|whitefin@arkonviox.com|02/01/02 at 20:05:01|Whitefin|xx|0|203.51.31.85|Bwahaha, thanks Arkon :) Since I can't use the dangith e-mail submit thingie at the end of the cook book, i'll post it here.<br><br>Whitefin<br>whitefin@arkonviox.com<br>Cavern of Hope's Mock Croc Mud Pudding<br>Ecco: DoTF<br>Serves 3 or more.<br><br>1 packet chocolate whip<br>3 teaspoons cocoa power<br>300ml (1/2 pint) cold milk<br>1 packet chocolate Bourbon biscuits<br>Small packet of almond flakes<br>Green glace cherries<br>Icing pen set<br>Green drinking straws<br>Small plastic bag<br>Food whisk<br>Rolling pin<br>Mixing bowl<br><br><br>1. Split four biscuits in half to give eight complete half-biscuits. Put the remaining biscuits and any broken bits in a small plastic bag.<br>2. Take the creamy half of a biscuit. Use a red icing pen to make a thick line round three sides of the filling. Place a big blob of icing at the end.<br>3. Cut almond flakes into triangles for teeth. Press upright into the red icing.<br>4. Cut a green cherry in half for eyes. Cut another into two quaters for nostrils. Put a blob of icing sugar under each eye and nostril.<br>5. Press two eyes and nostrils onto each biscuit top. Use yellow icing to outline nostrils, and red and yellow for dangerous looing eyes. Carefully rest top half on toothy half. Gently squeeze neck together.<br>6. Use a rolling pin to crush the biscuits in the plastic bag.<br>7. Pour milk into mixing bowl. Add the chocolate whip mix and cocoa. Whisk until light and creamy. Mix in the crushed biscuits and the rest of the almond flakes.<br>8. Spoon mixture into desert bowls. Leave to set for 10 minuets, then gently rest a croc in each dish. Press the neck ends down into the 'mud'. Push in cut straws to look like reeds. Your scarry treats are now  ready to eat! Great for partys.||

Re: COOK BOOK UP?|Trellia|Liz_2emeadow@hotmail.com|02/03/02 at 11:40:14|Trellia|xx|0|24.78.125.249|eee, hehe, lookit me, ill post a vegetarian one! &gt;:] *ebilness and crap*<br><br>Trellia<br>Liz_2emeadow@hotmail.com<br>Trellia's Bay Tofu Toes<br>Ecco: TOT<br>Serves between 1-2 ppl<br><br>You'll need:<br>1 packet of firm tofu<br>Soy sauce<br>sesame oil<br>a knife<br>a frying pan<br>a stove top<br><br>1. Take your tofu and cut the large chunk into 1/4's (usually there will be lines already in the tofu)<br><br>2. Cut your tofu into approx 1 cm slices. They should look like little thin rectangles <br><br>3. Turn the stove on (medium high) and wait just a bit for the frying pan to heat up<br><br>4. Put in the sesame oil, just enuf to cover your tofu, and watch your tofu sizzle! &gt;:]<br><br>5.Turn over tofu when you think the one side is done (they should be golden brown to darker brown depending on how crunchy you want the outside to be)<br><br>6. Wait untill both sides are nice and browned, adn turn the oven off (attention: there is no such thing as &quot;undercooking&quot; tofu, and you cant get samonella or any other disease from eating raw tofu, raw tofu only tastes bad)<br><br>7. grab your tofu toes and place them on a plate, drizzle soy sauce on them<br><br>8. Chow down! Tofu toes are an excellent alternative to chicken fingers (thus the name) and they are excellent served with asain noodles/rice. Try them with a veggie stir-fry!<br><br><br>||
