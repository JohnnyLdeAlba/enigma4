BTW, on a side note, I am taking requests at this time, so yay for you people, I will only take 10, and once I have five done, I will take another five.<br><br>So give me a detailed description and if you want colours, every speck of RGB value 0o;; heh. Or you can have monochrome. I can draw human forms, your dolphin chara, or your dolphin chara as a merphin.<br><br>Send them in!||

You could include late-day colours (oranges etc.) to add to the effect, and perhaps a reflection? I dunno if that's enough detail for you, but I hope you get the basic idea.<br><br>Thanks!!! ;D ;D ;D||

The colors in the CG pic are better so I'd suggest waiting till he puts it up. &nbsp;Or else I can just send a link to the picture on Side 7. &nbsp;If you can, make her look shiny, with the feel of a polished gemstone. I really don't know what I want as far as things like background or pose..I'm sure you can think of something. &nbsp;Thanks in advance! &nbsp;;D||
