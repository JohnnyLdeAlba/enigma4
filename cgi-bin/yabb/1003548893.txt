new character|Tiarra|isonadorai@aol.com|10/19/01 at 21:34:52|Guest|xx|0|64.12.106.21|Okay, first of all, I just noticed this whoe time the e-mail address in my profile had a typo in it...<br><br>But anyway, I finally came up with an Ecco-related character. &nbsp;I have a picture, but I have to scan it yet and then I need to uploadit onto my site so I can post it here. Then, I will need an avatar,and I was hoping someone could do that for me...<br><br>Well, Tiarra is actually the name of a character of mine which wouldn't really fit in the universe of Ecco. So this name no longer works. &nbsp;So, as soon as I post this, I will change my account name, which means I will need to delete this one. And I will immediately post a responsehere once I do that. So, the next time you see me, I will be Tethys.|||
Formally known as Tiarra|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/19/01 at 22:00:12|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.106.21|[color=Green]Well, I did it. &nbsp;For now, I have in my signature &quot;formerly known as Tiarra&quot; which will be there for a while so that when I post in other subjects, people will know who I am if they haven't read this. &nbsp;Once everyone, or at least most people, discover that my username has changed and who I actually was, then I will put something different. &nbsp;If I can think of anything...I will post my character pic later so everyone knows what Tethys looks like. And later I will explain a little bit about her. [/color]|||

Re: new character|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/20/01 at 19:30:23|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.167|¡Muchas gracias! &nbsp;;D I'm glad you liked it! It's a pencil drawing, of course, but I also did a little tweeking w/ Photoshop, though not much.|||
about Tethys|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/20/01 at 19:59:25|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.167|[color=Teal]Okay, so here's the idea behind my new character. &nbsp;First of all, I got the name Tethys from Greek mythology, and I've never heard it pronounced out loud, but from my experiance in how Greek names are pronounced, it is probably TETH-iss. &nbsp;I don't know much about Tethys, but I do know she is a titaness and the wife of Oceanus, who personifies the ocean.<br><br>Aaannnee-wayyy...my character, Tethys, belongs to a race of dolphin-like creatures called Sanayas that live on...a planet which I have never named...I think it is probably in another dimension. &nbsp;I actually made up Sanayas a long time ago, but I changed the appearance somewhat (originally they just looked like ordinary dolphins but with different colors). Sanayas come in all colors of the spectrum. &nbsp;They are the...um, I can't think of the word I want...they are like the &quot;master race&quot; of their planet, just like humans are the &quot;master race&quot; of Earth. &nbsp;Like dolphins, they used to live on land, and they built great structures like what humans build and they had great technology. &nbsp;Now that they've evolved more, they have decided they were better off without the technology they had. &nbsp;But they have also developed through evolution telekinetic abilities, and they are starting to go back to the use of technology. &nbsp;Tethys, a young scientist, has become the first Sanaya to travel to a different dimension, and her first travels have taken her to Earth...[/color]|||

I like it because it's of a creature you don't see many drawings of! You did a great job... :D ...and I really like your drawing of your character. I like the uniqueness of her tail fins...pretty cool pic...;)|||
Re: new character|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/21/01 at 13:41:39|Tethys|smiley|0|64.12.104.162|Thanks!  ;D  Actually the manatee thing didn't turn out as good as I hoped but it's been ages since I've drawn anything realistic other than for art class.  And, of course, I had never drawn a manatee before.  But it wasn't really that hard, it was a kind of like drawing a dolphin, because they are shaped similarly. And I'm glad you like my character pic, despite the fact I suck at coloring. :P That's why I usually do coloring with PSP, but it takes a lot longer.  I will probably write a fanfic about Tethys...eventually. If I ever get around to it. :P|||

Anyway, I checked the link again, and it's not working even when you go directly to the link. Tethys, I'd suggest sending it to Arkon so he can put it up on the Fan Artwork section...that way people will be sure to see it! It belongs there if ya ask me...anyway... ;)|||

Re: new character|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/25/01 at 19:14:08|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.59|Maybe it would work if you typed in the URL? I haven't actually linked to the image from my site yet, but maybe I should. <br><br>Actually my signature refers to the fact that Tethys was the first of her kind to travel through zero space (or whatever it's called--the space worm holes go thro) and explore another dimension, but got lost and ended up being stuck in this dimension where a little planet called Earthis located...<br><br>And Tethys is a Sanaya, which is something I made a few years ago...I don't remember why I did, tho. &nbsp; But anyway, they have a very advanced civilization...or, they used to, before they renounced technology their ancestors were much more advanced then humans. But now they're turning back to technology, as I mentioned in my description, and back to the sort of society they used to have. So now, although they look very much like dolphins, they are also quite similar to humans in many ways. They have scientists, teachers, and other sorts of professions like that. |||

Re: new character|Tethys|isonadorai@aol.com|10/28/01 at 15:08:11|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.193.44|Ooohh yeah. I was gonna talk a little bit about the world from which Tethys comes. &nbsp;I finally came up with a name: Mundagua (I got that from the Spanish words &quot;mundo&quot; for &quot;world&quot; and &quot;aqua&quot; for &quot;water&quot;, so it's &quot;water world&quot;. I know, it's stupid...). &nbsp;It is about 90% water, but it didn't used to be that way. &nbsp;During the time of the Ayakines, the ancestors of the Sanayas, Mundagua was only 65% water. &nbsp;But, as the climate grew warmer, the ice caps melted, and the land was flooded. &nbsp;The Ayakines evolved in order to survive, and eventually became the Sanayas.<br><br>The words &quot;Sanaya&quot; and &quot;Ayakine&quot; are words I made up, but I have also created meanings for them: Ayakine means &quot;gem dog&quot; (because they resembled dogs) and Sanaya means &quot;sea gem.&quot; In both cases, the &quot;gem&quot; part refers to the fact that they both came in mutliple colors and were all shiny like gem stones.|||
