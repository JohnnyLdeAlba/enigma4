Or felt.||

It was just because DG asked me to explain, so I did. But, now it's gone.  So all I can say is, if you really wana know about manic depression, look it up.  Or...you can..PM me or e-mail me or something, I suppose...||

I usually just go beat up my brother to relieve anger or swear at them or yell or purposely do something just to make them mad...oh it's all great fun. and i never get in trouble...<br>by the way your picture is sweeet!<br><br>oh and doomtrain what you said makes you sound a little shall we say...&quot;cuckoo&quot;<br><br>by the way I would just like to state that all female's bad moods can not be blamed on PMS. we do occasionally take a break from being all sugar and spice and everything nice and believe it or not it sometimes is not in response to our what our body is going through. Girls can be bitches all the time, not just once a month, trust me i know some.<br>well I just wanted to clear up that assumption &nbsp;;D||
