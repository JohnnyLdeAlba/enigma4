See, this is one of the rules posted at the Art Contest section of the site:<br><br>[i]&quot;The rules for joninig are simple. All art work must relate to the aquamarine theme...i.e. it can be sharks killer whales, dolphins, anything you can think of that relates to owr beloved sea - even imagined made up things. Ecco the Dolphin is the winning thing people look for but you can come up with things not related to it!&quot;[/i]<br><br>Yup...so anything that had to do with the ocean/sea will be accepted! Hope that answers yer question... :)|||

XD<br><br>Anyhow, stop worrying about this contest, most of the people entering are probably gonna wait until the last month before the contest closes to send in their art.
