Earth Clan Meeting|Arkonviox|Arkonviox@arkonviox.com|01/01/02 at 21:10:23|Arkonviox|xx|0|63.253.7.68|Well there isn't much to talk about for a secreat group such as Earth Clan but seeing this forum dead i thought id give it a jump start.<br><br>Anyhow i will explain my ban list why not.<br><br>I use it cause the forum doesn't have a way to keep track of people i banned. As far as the forum is concerned your all just numbers, or ip's<br><br>Now for other things why are people banned? Some people are hypicrytes and some are just annoying. Thats why there not here they ruin topics with nonsense and break the flow of things on this site.<br><br>Ha ha now that that is explained i might as well bring some thing off key...<br><br>I been working on the story to my Project Arkon story which is the first part Ecco the Dolphin: A Stone in Time. Hopefully i will finish it so it can finally be shown to the public.<br><br>Thats it for now i might have some issues to bring up maybe about owr mods maybe questions to what do you think your jobs are?||

Remember it had to be ecco related or related to my website anything else it has to be moved.<br><br>2. If its a new person posting a topic in the general thats off topic they will be able to get away with it only once. If its so off topic that it relly shouldnt be in the general move it!<br><br>||
