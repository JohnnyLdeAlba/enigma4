a bit of a problem..|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/28/01 at 21:02:45|Tethys|sad|0|64.12.103.176|I've already contacted Arkon about this, but I was wondering if anyone else might be able to somehow help me. &nbsp;I am having a problem with QuickTime and this web site. &nbsp;You see, my mom got this digital camera for Christmas (this is the first one we've ever had) and now QuickTime has appeared on our computer. &nbsp;So I assume she installed it and that it is part of the software that came with the camera, and probably necessary for veiwing things off of it. &nbsp;But since then, everytime I open Arkonviox.com, it makes everything on my computer run slow. &nbsp;It's only when the website is open, and only this particular website, and it doesn't even matter whether or not I have QuickTime open. &nbsp;I've only opened it once and just to try and see if I could figure out if there was anything I could do to it. &nbsp;Arkon gave me a different link to use, and that is the only reason I am in the forum now. &nbsp;Because every part of the site, not just the main page, was making things run slowly. &nbsp;If nothing can be done, I will be stuck getting in the back way all the time. &nbsp;I think the link he gave me was really the one he used for a preview of the new look. &nbsp;When I asked Arkon about this, he said it was QuickTime, and that I might be able to disable it somehow. &nbsp;but I have no clue how. &nbsp;I can't really get rid of it if it is necessary to veiw images from the digital camera. &nbsp;Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do? &nbsp;Or at least know how I can get help or contact someone?||

Re: a bit of a problem..|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/28/01 at 21:45:50|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.176|Oh. &nbsp;Of course. &nbsp;I knew exactly what you meant.||
Re: a bit of a problem..|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/28/01 at 21:50:35|Tethys|xx|0|64.12.103.176|Well I found QuickTime in the control panel, but I didn't find any way to disable anything. &nbsp;Only change certain settings. &nbsp;There were some things that I wasn't quite certain about what it was supposed to do, but none of them looked like it would help in any way.||

One question that came to mind though in reading this thread of messages, is...how recent is the version of quicktime...(you can check this by clicking on the Help menu on the QuickTime window, then go to the bottom of the pop up menu that says, About QuickTime. By selecting that, it shows you the version you have. Mine happens to be version 5.0.2)...though I'm guessing anything that would've installed it on your computer would've made sure to install the most up to date version. Another thing...do you hear music when you're at Arkonviox.com? If so...perhaps that's the conflict...like Arkon said...the midi files. Try disabling the Jukebox at the top left of the home page. Click on the pull down arrow, and select Disable. Maybe that would speed things up here on the site...?...I dunno really, just trying to suggest things. I hope you can figure something out... :-/<br><br>Oh, and Arkon...just to let you know, since you've redesigned the site, and added back in the midi files to play while at yer site...I haven't experienced any problems...so I think this is just an isolated case with Tethys...unfortunately.||

Re: a bit of a problem..|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/29/01 at 19:55:32|Tethys|xx|0|152.163.204.74|Actually the site is working just fine today.<br><br>But I just found another problem that could be related.<br><br>You see, I have AOL, and when I turned on my speakers to see if I could hear the music, all I could hear was &quot;wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel&quot;....etc. &nbsp;The guy that says &quot;welcome&quot; when you sign on to AOL is stuttering, and he can't seem to shutup.<br><br>It has nothing to do with the wesbite. &nbsp;I closed it just to make sure. &nbsp;Then closed AOL all together and signed back on, and it was still stuttering. &nbsp;So I rebooted the computer, signed on to AOL again, and it's still doing that.<br><br>The point is, the sound card, or something else having to do with sound, is messed up. &nbsp;It may just be AOL, or it could be the computer. &nbsp;I should try playing music or something and see what happens. &nbsp;But since I never have the speakers on, there's no telling how long this could have been going on. &nbsp;It could have something to do with why this site was slowing things down. &nbsp;Or it might have something to do with why the site is -not- slowing things down today, if it's interferring with the jukebox. &nbsp;If I really could have fixed the problem I had for the past few days, except for today, by disableing the jukebox, then maybe if whatever is causing the &quot;welcome&quot; to stutter is interferring with it and not allowing it to play and that's why the site is fine now. &nbsp;But, since I don't know how long this has been going on, it could be that whatever was causing the sound on AOL to be messed up was also causing this site to make everything slow down because of the jukebox. <br><br>And since I never turn on my speakers and therefore don't know how long this has been going on, I have no idea if it might have anything to do with QuickTime.||

As for the latest problem.........drivers perhaps? Or connection trouble? ???||

Re: a bit of a problem..|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/30/01 at 21:05:20|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.24|There is no &quot;MIME settings&quot; button. &nbsp;There's a pop-down menu, and the only thing I found that might change things in such a way as to fix the problem is &quot;File Type Associations&quot;. &nbsp;But there's only 3 things, and the two things checked are &quot;Windows type files&quot; and &quot;Internet type files&quot; (the other one is &quot;Macintosh type files&quot; and we don't have a Mac). &nbsp;I figure it might help if I unchecked the &quot;internet type files&quot; but I'm not sure if that will affect anything that I don't want to be affected.<br><br>On the other hand, everything seems to be fine now. &nbsp;But I still don't know what's wrong with AOL and if that ahs anything to do with it. &nbsp;Like I said, it's possible that the only reason this site isn't acting up any more could be because of, or related to, the problem with the sound on AOL. &nbsp;I guess I'll have to wait until we can find out a solution for that and see what happens.||
