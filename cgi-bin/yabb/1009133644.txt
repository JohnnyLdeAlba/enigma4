He gets his coffee, 2. we sing a christmas carol (highly annoying) and 3. he unwraps all his gifts, and he has to be the slowest un-wrapper on this side the planet! I mean when he's finished you can practically reuse the wrapping paper that covered his gifts! Sheesh...<br><br>Well those are mine anyway. <br><br>PS: I just got my contacts in! ^_^ No more glasses (now I need a haircut, damn bangs!)||
