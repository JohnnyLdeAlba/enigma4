Which game has the best music?|Flamingo_Jiff|f_jiff@hotmail.com|10/29/01 at 11:35:48|Flamingo_Jiff|xx|0|172.190.155.118| ::) Which game, do you think has the best music...1,2,Jr or Defender Of The Future. Personally I love the music from DOTF, especially on the menu where it says &quot;press start&quot;. The music on 2 is pretty good, only it is in midi.<br>What do you think? :-/|||
