I wonder who'll win the art contest? Sarcasm|Tidesinger|krystal2001@hotmail.com|01/11/02 at 16:07:57|Tidesinger|xx|0|213.122.227.207|If you ask me, it's fairly obvious. I checked out all the entries and I swear I nearly collapsed when I saw Swift Currents entry.<br>I swear that I had to actually enlarge the pic to check if it was just an image pulled off DOF....<br>I'd like to say this. Swift, You're an ace artist, and I hope I can be as good as you someday. Hell, you're better than my teacher at school at art. By the way, I hope your pic sells. I haven't actually seen it, but from what everyone's saying it must be good. So good luck to ya &nbsp;:)||

Amazing! Way better then my art teach is too. Of course, that's not hard to beat. My art teacher sucks.<br>But I'm cheering for Swift! She dose desurve it. Go Swift!!!<br><br>And I'm glad you guys like mine. It was supposed to be a joke pic...and a joke it is up to Swift's. ^_^ Now that I acctually know what Ark and Crest look like, I think I should draw another one of the gang.

I think it's great!<br><br>*pokes her in the flank*<br><br>Never, EVER bad mouth your own stuff! It's not healthy, mentally or otherwise. Everyone improves given time, no matter how "crappy" or "lousy" they think their art is at the time. You can never get worse, time can only improve things. <br><br>Like one of my favorite mottos go: " No matter how good you are, there's always someone, somewhere who's better than you." Well...that could go for anyone....except Arkie. XD<br><br>You'd die of you saw some of my first pictures...or just the ones that are only about 4 years old.....time does wonders, especially if you KEEP PRACTICING and working to improve dispite what some other people might say. <br><br>Here's a little bit of a tid-bit for ya'll.....my father was NOT happy when I started drawing and painting dragons...he wanted me to stay with dolphins and "not waste my time" with dragons. Obviously I didn't listen....point is, do what you love and things can only get better.<br><br>I'm gonna stop rantin' now...I think I've taken up enough space and time. XD<br><br>||

Wise words...everyone listen to Swifty if they think they suck!<br>But yeah, I agree. You shouln't dis yourself. No matter how bad I think I suck now, when I look at pics I drew only two months ago, I laugh. I've really improved over a short time.<br>Like you said, you can only get better, and I can't wait to see new pics from you! If you're that great now, you'll be even better soon!!!||
