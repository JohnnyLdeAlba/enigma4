But you just can't beat Michal Jackson. *whooo!* &nbsp;;)<br>2. Oh god! That new crap by the backstreet boys. Sorry, I really don't like their music. Maybe I would if they didn't play it every ten minutes on the radio!<br>3. Hmmm...well I met a lot of new people going into a new school. But I don't really like any of them that much. Probably you guys in here. Always good for a laugh!<br>4. Heh heh. We're not gonna talk about that. &nbsp;;) Nah I'm just kidding. I guess I introduced Final Fantasy to Nesa. I've known her for a long time, but we're real close now. We have a lot in common.<br>5. Proud of. Well gee, 2001 must have been my best year ever. I did really good in school, which lead up to my doing really good this year in school. I drew a lot, getting better at it. I beat a lot of Final Fantasy's too. But the thing I'm most proud of, was getting invided to play on teachers hockey team in our school tournament, after my team got kicked out. &nbsp;:)<br>6. Well I'm not so proud of treating anyone I did mean or unfair. I'm very sarcastic, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I hate people being rude or assholes. I can't stand people like that, and I don't like it when I act like one.<br>7. Never forget? Well although I didn't do much this summer, I really enjoyed it. The weather was great and I had the best time with my friends Delphi and Jader. I love your guys! ::)<br>8. Well I just joined a while ago, so I'm not really up to par on this place. But the stories and stuff that go on in here are all unforgettable!<br>9. Heh heh. I never make those. I can never think of one I'll keep. ||
