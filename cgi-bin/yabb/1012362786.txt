Back, With A Story|K|kschnee@mit.edu|01/29/02 at 20:53:05|K|lamp|0|18.247.2.55|Hi again. I finished the dolphin SF story I was working on, after realizing that the last version went nowhere for 2/3 of its length. The new one's all right; anyone care?<br><br>What's up with the Tidesinger series? I don't have the URL for it anymore, or know how far along it is.||

She was gonne do a tidesinger 2 but never finished cause she lost her internet and later on decided she didnt want back here...i dont think it was the ecco community cause if you knew her she owned her own community plus i think she just wanted out...(* i dont blame her *) <br><br>I would have asked her to put tidesinger up on my site but was afraid to ask her...if your interested email me and i will send you the story...||
