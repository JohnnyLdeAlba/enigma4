Had to do something with it.....|Trellius|trellius@freemail.absa.co.za|12/07/01 at 14:30:31|Trellius|xx|0|163.203.138.152| :) Well, I made these origionally to send to a friend, but now I have nothing better to do with them....... so.... I figured I could put them up on display here...if anyone was interested....Bare in mind that the origionals are avi but I had to make them low-quality Real media so the sound and picture quality are FAR from the origional.....but it did bring the overall size down from 30MB to 1.24MB  ;D So look or not, the choice is yours....<br>System of a down's Chopsuey &amp; ADEMA's Giving In<br>[url]http://www.geocities.com/tidesinger/[/url]<br><br>Let me know what you think...||12/07/01 at 15:12:34|Trellius
