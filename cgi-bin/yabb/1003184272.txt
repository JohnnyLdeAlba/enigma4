THE THREE PACTS|asteritius|asteritius@hotmail.com|10/15/01 at 16:17:52|asteritius|xx|0|217.216.121.33|As we could see in Ecco:DOF , in that alternative future dolphins were enslaved and divided in 3 pacts:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>CRIMSON &nbsp;(their creed:the peace)<br>CIRCLE &nbsp; &nbsp; (the faith , the infinity cycle)<br>MOVER &nbsp; &nbsp; (the action , the change)<br><br>Do you feel identificated with any of these pacts?<br>Why?<br>Are the dolphins truly divided , as the human beings are?<br>|||

Re: THE THREE PACTS|Swift Current|swift_exidus@hotmail.com|10/15/01 at 19:58:43|Swift_Current|xx|0|209.197.174.26|I'd have a hard time identifying with any one group. <br><br>I don't think that any one of the groups could have been able to work effectivly under man's control without the existance of the other groups in order to keep Man's illusion of greatness intact. The Crimson inforced man's will and kept order, the movers worked themselves to death for man's greatness, and the Cirlce's prophacy confirmed that it was a good thing to do so. (Or at least that's how I read things...)<br><br><br>Either way, they all suffered horribly under then hand of man. And in the end Ecco was at least able to show them that all dolphins were as one, no one group over the other. |||

Myself...well, I'd be either of the Crimson or of the Circle. The action/change qualities of the Movers totally doesn't fit me...hehe! Anyway, nice Ecco conversation asteritius...thanks for the topic...;D|||
