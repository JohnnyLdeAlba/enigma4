Hey guys,|EccoChick|sonicecco@hotmail.com|11/12/01 at 10:02:11|EccoChick|xx|0|207.69.124.237|Ah, I'm gonna explain why I havent been around lately.<br>I play the Tennor Sax in band and I have been nominated out of lots of band students to this competition called &quot;The festival of Bands&quot; ok..so I'm super excited and all. I have been practicing so much lately that I havent been able to do much of anything. Including sleep &nbsp; &nbsp;:P. I get a break now because my instrument is messed up and is in the repair shop getting worked on. I guess its a good thing it broke in a way, hehe. Right now I am at my grandma's house being bored x.x . I'm not at school because of some holiday or teachers work day or somethin' I forget. So I decided to drop by. She has a mac computer and it is confusing me outta my mind &nbsp;:-O well see yaq|||

Re: Hey guys,|EccoChick|sonicecco@hotmail.com|12/09/01 at 10:29:05|EccoChick|xx|0|64.0.99.233| :) thanks guys, I've missed you too! Well alastor, I did try out for all state and made it to the 2nd part, but, thats only part of what I've been doing. I got nominated out of my band by my band directors. They sent my nomination tho the University Of Georgia to see if I made it to Mid-Fest and I did! Well, this weekend I went to Athens, Georgia and tried out for chair..got 2nd by the way  :D, we checked into a hotel, exectutive suites! I had 36 hours of rehersal in the whole weekend. Its like I never got a break. I hardly got any sleep anyways due to excitement and having fun. I learned alot up there and got lots of band experience. We played some pretty tough songs, and remember, we had to learn them in 2 days.We played things like Trepak from the nutcracker, Chanson, a french song, Abington's Ridge, and 2 brittish folk songs. Well, I have to go to sing at a christmas concert..man.. so much music x.x  Well, see you guys later!!<br><br><br>                     ||

Re: Hey guys,|dolphingirl|dolphingirl@arkonviox.com|12/10/01 at 14:03:22|dolphingirl|xx|0|63.206.170.53|Congrats chica! ;D ...on everything really, but especially for making 2nd chair! Impressive! It's cool to hear you're doing so much music stuff...I sure miss it. When ya grow up, you get less chances to participate in those types of things...so take advantage of it while you can! So, now that the weekend filled with challenging songs is over...does that mean you might be coming her more often then?...well, anyhow, nice to see you again chica! ;) ...take care!||
