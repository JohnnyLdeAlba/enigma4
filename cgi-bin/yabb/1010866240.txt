My correction|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/12/02 at 13:10:39|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|Well it was really bugging me that I had gotten Arkon and Crestoe's characters all wrong in my picture, so I had to re-draw them. I have this picky compultion thing...I can't help it. Anyhow, I know there still not perfect but it'll shut myself up about it. So you can look at it in my fanart as soon as Ark gets it up. I hope you like it.<br>I really like drawing the characters in this place, so I hope no one minds if I do that. Just tell me if you don't want me too and I wont.<br>Well, I hope you like it Arkon and Crestoe. I'll stop my complaining now.||

Re: My correction|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 13:40:17|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|Well I'm glad you like that other pic Histronic. I think your character looks one of the best in it. I didn't really know what anyone looked like (I was basing everyone on face pics), worst of all Arkon and Crestoe, that's why I did that new one. But I think I got Silversporks expression just right...<br>o.o;;;;;;;;;;;;;<br>Ha ha! Well, I hope no one minded that I popped them in that pic, and if I did, I hope you like you!||

Seems like everyone is on some sort of creative spurt or something. Here is hoping it continues. ;)||
Re: My correction|Histronic|john__cool@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 16:17:55|Histronic|xx|0|209.242.238.27|I was thinking i was gonan make a pic liek that long ago, in extreme cartoon style.  Arkon's in the front, squishing a globe model in one fin that has an arkonviox.com flag sticking out of it.  tass (Back when crestoe was a dog) is behind him doing the bunny ears thing.  Whitefin is sitting on top of a mountain of plushies, huggling a suffocating Histronic and pimped out yogoat.  Vantid is merely holding a dictionary and looking bored.  Back when i thought of that pic, those people were the major players in the ecco community.||

Re: My correction|Doomtrain|doomtrain23@hotmail.com|01/13/02 at 17:31:54|Doomtrain|xx|0|24.64.138.131|Thanks Swift, I'm glad you like it! It's always good to get words like that, it makes me want to draw more. &nbsp;;)<br>I like drawing the characters in this place because everyones so interesting in here. Unfortunatly I'm not a huge Ecco fan, so I'm not very experienced with dolphin drawing. Drawing Final Fantasy maybe, but not dolphins. But I am becoming more of an Ecco fan now, and Delphi introduced me to DotF which I really like, so maybe when it comes out for the PSX2 I'll get it. ||

Eventually. :P<br>And ok, maybe my pictures don't suck (that much), but they are boring. I'm no good with backgrounds, and perspective and stuff...so I always just leave that out.
