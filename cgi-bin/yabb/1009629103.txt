Re: Levels...|Tethys|IaSoIedad@aol.com|12/29/01 at 19:09:16|Tethys|xx|0|205.188.197.187|Actually, it's pretty simple. &nbsp;You just swim up to the top of the cave the Asterite is in, then go in and swim in between the two rows of globes. &nbsp;You have to be somewhat careful because if you bump the globes while he's swirling around like he does, you will get pushed out. &nbsp;So move slowly.<br><br>I actually had a problem with this before (before I new about the cheat code) because even when I got to the exit, it wouldn't work for some reason. &nbsp;It wasn't that I couldn't get to it, it just wouldn't go to the next level. &nbsp;There musta been a bug or something, but it finally started working after about a million tries.||

It's working !!!! &nbsp; :D &nbsp;:D &nbsp;:D &nbsp;:D<br>If I want to go in the level &quot;The Pod&quot;, I must use the debug mode, but in what level ?<br>I ask a lot of questions, because I'm a beginner in &quot;Ecco 2 - The tides of time&quot;...But, I'm good at Ecco DOF.||

Well I have at Delphi's house (and I think it's really fun ^_^), but I don't own a Dreamcast. I always thought the ones for genisis really blew,but DotF is so much fun! I don't really play the levels so much a jump around and enjoy the view.<br>Yes, yes...maybe I am a bit of a graphics whore.<br>Maybe I'd like to get it for PSX2 when it comes out. And when I get a PSX2... :-/||
