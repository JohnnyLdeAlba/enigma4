In other words, i'm playing a twoface. I'm sided on Arkonviox.com, but I act like i'm on Psy's side *laughs* Evil-ne?<br><br>Hello fellow members.<br><br>From today, this list will be closed. I've explained why on the Caverns of<br>Hope. Go there to see the news:<br>http://www.caverns-of-hope.de.vu/<br><br>If anyone still wants to contact me, email me at<br>PsySonic@planetdreamcast.com<br><br>Anyway, it was a great time, but there will be greater times, I'm sure about<br>that :)<br><br>&gt;&gt; PsySonic &gt;&gt;<br><br>Then on his main page...<br><br>Monday, 22. October, 2001 (PsySonic):<br>First of all: A big welcome to all PlanetDreamcast visitors, as well as to every other visitor ;)<br>The big update as announced is today! There are four main points for today.<br>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First: I've moved to PlanetDreamcast since I applied to getting hosted and they decided to take my site. This is great for the site cause I got now a reliable and fitting place for it! I've got now enough space to also add bigger files such as good quality music. <br>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second: I've taken down the chatroom and the mailing list and won't be adding any interactive stuff for now. There are several reasons for this. One reason is that I want to concentrate on site stuff, but I will explain this in the next point. The only interaction will take place via email. I want YOU to become part of this site by adding your own Ecco stuff. What you get for that is a cool place for your information and credit :) <br>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Third: My plans for the next months are that I want to take the Ecco games apart, which means that I want to make sprite sheets, upload music from the games, create maps etc. That will mainly be based on the Genesis games, but also the GameGear and the PC games will also be handled. My question to YOU as a site visitor is now to decide if you would like to have influence in this project by adding your own stuff to the site. If you have fun playing with Ecco games you will have fun with this.<br>Email me to tell me what you would like to do, like making a sprite sheet or ripping backgrounds. It's also possible to add more than one thing. We will discuss it to see if I or other visitors are already working on it which would be useless... We could Of course you will be credited! Decide if you want to join the fun and become part of this project or ... not ;) <br>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fourth: The site updates for today... My email address has been changed to PsySonic@planetdreamcast.com. I've added a (Non-)Ecco Newsboard with news and articles about Ecco and other dolphin related stuff, look at it on the top of this page... Be sure to submit your own articles! I've added an Odd Things page about Ecco DotF to the Games section, as well as a General Music page. A MP3 page has been added to the Downloads section. A new fanfict by Vantid as well as a Fan Music section have been added to the Fan Stuff section. Also some minor things have been changed here and there, nothing important, though.<br><br>Grrr|||
