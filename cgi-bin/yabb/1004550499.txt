If one of you download 'apprentice' you can play Magic the gathering online, but dont be cheap, cause it lets you make a deck out of all existing cards. I have all but two, so I dont use those two. I once got up tp the champion in the league, I think it was John Crapashits, but I lost. I almost won, but he used a lightning bolt card. The friend I heard Blackfin from, his name was andrej.:goofy: :pimp:<br>||
