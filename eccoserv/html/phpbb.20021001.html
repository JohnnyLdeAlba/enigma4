Arkon is going to run the forums again, or something, I dunno. Right now, the old database is pretty much trashed to the point where its going to be reset and rereg time. This isn't to say the database is fragile, just that like any precision machine, it doesn't tolerate being misused or abused very well. I've spent probably close to 20 and some hours working on the forums, including restoring tediously by hand. Not to mention the disk space, CPU time, and bandwith. Basically right now, I don't have the will to go and restore this thing a whole second time. I'm pretty much beyond caring, since all I seem to be getting is negative return.So with this post, I'm basically backing out of the community for now. I really don't have the time or the will to deal with the workload and the stress anymore. I'll still keep the IRC server up, and idle there, since thats pretty much required of me by NationMedia policy.

Shadow i relly wish youd reconsider, I am upset that you don't want to be inolved anymore but i can understand.I myself have had to work many many hours for soemthing that ends up getting thrown away. Its not that i want to its just that sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.This forum is gonna take me alot of time to learn and understand. Despite what has happened i relly did appreciate your work, you have done alot for this site and i hope we can work again in the future.I will give you time to think things over but i relly want you to stay! and ifyou dont i will badger you into it!im justmessing with you but understand even though i might have been fucked up to you its not because i don't appreciate what you have done or dislike anything. I go through alot of crash courses to better understand everything on my website weather its programming or my home personal computer. Im only satisfied when im comfortable and i should have taken the time to setup an exparamental forum on my site and keapt the one you setup going and worked on that one when i have learned more and fully exparamented.Take care Shadow, your a great person!

hmmmm it could even be a story tellling contest (or comic) Lets take Ecco and friends, but place them into familular farie tales....like "little red riding hood" but with ecco as red, and un Vortex drone as wolf, wood chopper as Asterite and I donno....Trella (not our Trella) as Grandma (or the other way around)I think somthing like that wold be funny...or 'fan fic a movie plot with ecco-type characters"who's up for it?if we'd do a comic, each person submits a page or so, picking up where the other left off?  the change in drawing styals would make it funny, because it would change so much.....*soapboxes* I think we should! 8O

I don't know if any of you care or watch the olymics, but I'm a big fan of it, and especialy figure skateing. I was outraged by last nights outcome. That gold medal was clearly Canadas. They were totally robbed! I'm not at all picking sides because I'm Canadian, and I do agree that the Russian skaters were also very good, but not better."Jamie Sale and David Pelletier (the Canadian skaters) flawless skate earned them a silver after judges scored a less-than-perfect Russian routine higher." Even after Jamie Sale and the Russian skater, Anton Sikharulidze, crash into eachother during warmup.Was anyone watching? What do you guys think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
words of wisdom posts? what do you think that its my fucking fault?Your gonna like the way i do the forum weather you want to or not!

Indeed...the outcome of the medaling for the pairs in figure skating was thouroughly messed up. Everyone knows it too. I think it was a good decision to suspend the Russian judge from judging till they get things figured out. Seems like I heard just today, that they're probably going to re-award the Canadian team with the gold...and if/when they do, they'll have another medal ceremony doing so, so that they can hear their country's anthem played...and all that goes with winning the gold. I agree with everyone in that they should've had that gold in their pockets! They skated beautifuly...the Russians...well...skated like crap if ya ask me. So...hopefully the whole thing can be resloved...as it should be. I really like watching the Olympics...saw the snowboarding half pipe events...some skiing ones...but I really like those figure skating events... :) ...anyway, happy "Olympic" watching to those of you out there who do watch them!

Hmmm...well I sure hope things can get smoothed out just as soon as possible...feels as if we're all tryin to go forward after some site-earth quake or something... :( ...best of luck to you Arkon...and all those helping you!

It would be cool if they gave them their gold, but what I really want to know is what the russian pair thinks. I haven't heard a word from them, or any people from russia for that matter. And I think they know that they didn't desurve it.

They watch as the group run into a stop. The leader turns and commands the rest to keep going. The lader spots Ecco and Delta and tell them to come out.

Delta appears suddenly in back of ecco and asks the strange dolphin why he knocked them out. The dolphin laughed and said he didn't want them to know the way into the city. 11. Delta then asks why they brought them instead of abadoning them. The strange dolphin says because you and that dolphin knew too much to begin with and mentioned knowing about the time machines. Delta then asks the dolphin who are you then the dolphin introduces himself as crestoe.12. Crestoe tells Ecco and Delta they are in a city called Thira located miles under ground with an only passage linked somewhere in Tantalus. He said he brought them because they were seeking the time machine and thought there King would be interested in why and what should be done with them. Crestoe said he doesnt know yet but anyone who seeks the time machine may be a threat and can be reguarded as criminals who shouldnt pass word of what they know.13.

I think a comic is s great idea. Something that I discussed with Delphi a while ago that I was going to do, but I'm just to damn lazy. I suppose I could have now that the teachers are on strike and I have no school. Huh, mayeb I can help though.

<div id='container'>
hmm...well...whatever.

Well, updated... they got their gold medal! It wasn't technically presented to them the way it should have been, I don't think, but at least they got it, right?But I was just watching Entertainment Tonight, and you know what this one guy on it said? "Well then... why not give EVERYONE a gold medal?" I was like "Because not everyone deserves a gold medal, asshole, but they do, so GO TO HELL AND BURN!"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ahhh..I thought so. To bad.  Even tho' you weren't happy with it. It still looks awesome. Look on the bright side, at least da puppy didn't walk all over it when it was nearly finished rather that when he actually did it.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes! They got their medal! They desurved it all the way too. I think there having another little mini-medal ceremony for them, but I'm not to sure. I know that guy making that gold medal for them is having one, or somthing like one. Oh yeah! If you have any old gold jewlery you don't want kickn' around, then check this place out//www.goldmedalcanadians.com/I think it's a neat idea. But a little less meaningful now that they got the gold. But still...

Im sorry but i do believe that the judges gave us higher marks and still, Russia needs it more than Canada, we are poorer and need more money. sorry if I offended you in any sort of way,good night.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That sounds like a good idea! Any one here from Yugoslavia? Possibly Monte Negro, Ive been there...BEAUTIFUL country, but not as beautiful as Russia.Na, just joking they're both pretty nice. Back to the point, I like your idea Doomtrain!P.S Like warhammer? Contact me for Hints and tips on collecting and fielding your favourite army fighting for your chosen gods.

Those are NOT elves!!! Their anatomy is totally wrong, elves are the most beautiful creatures to grace this planet, and that 'Woman' is far from being fair. Im sorry if I have offended you and do not wish to be "the crazy guy" in this site, but I think you should brush up your drawing knolage a little more. You drawings are GREAT but the elves bring down your overall skills. I wish I was as talented as you.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That ROCKS!!!! Dont fuck with us Vantid, the only reason that you are saying that your artwork is not good is because you want more attention and compliments. You cant cheat a russian(cheater).Your artwork is hella good and you know it!!!  You work is Damn good Vantid! Sorry about the telling off, but Im just sooo jealous of your work.

Tell me what Character you are most commonly and if you answer correctly I might consider giving you the code. (Ill give it to you anyway)But you must answer my question and this...What version diablo do you have?

heh heh i remember the eaos evil idea game
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Legolas? Are you an artist? If so than you should know that not everyone draws with the exact same idea of one thing. Maybe your perception of elves is different from Whitefin's and that's fine, but you should respect her own perception of those creatures. Er... sorry, it's early in the morning and I'm very grumpy in the morning... :? Beautiful art as always Whitefin!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's great to hear, Arkon!

<br />

<div id='container'>
where could I get one?  is it worth it or not.i need info on it.oh I saw a Sonic game on TV for gamecube......sonic and mario....neighbors!?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Uh, yeah.  My guess the reason for the elves looking different would be that they are imaginary creatures, and the only way to see them and know what they look like for sure is to drink at leat a pint of Jimmy Beam.  Of course, i could be wrong and and a group of elves lives next door to you, which in that case, your life is even fucking weirder than i thought.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That would be because there arent any earth clanners right now.

ebay.  You can get all sorts of weird shit on ebay.  Its where i got my mr. T air freshener.

We deserve a break from all this forum hassles. My dad sent this list to me.  If you become a teacher, never write these on a report card.1. Since my last report, your child has hit rock bottom and hasstarted to dig. 2. I would not allow this student to breed. 3. Your child has delusions of adequacy. 4. Your child is depriving a village of an idiot.5. Your son sets low personal standards and then consistentlyfails to achieve them. 6. The student has a "full six-pack" but lacks the plastic thing to hold it together. 7. This child has been working with glue too much. 8. When tour daughter's IQ reaches 50, she should sell.9. The gates are down, the lights are flashing, but the trainisn't here. 10. If this student were any more stupid, he'd have to be wateredtwice a week. 11. It's impossible to believe the sperm that created this childbeat out 1,000,000 others. 12. The wheel is turning but the hamster is goneHope you like.

<div id='container'>
Uh, hey Legolas! I'm assumeing your new, right? And hey, it wasn't my idea, Eao's the mastermind. behind this.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, Sonic's gone to the Gamecube. "Sonic Adventure 2 Battle", or something like that. He should of went to that PSX2...then I could play it. ^^
</div>

<div id='container'>
Brilliant!  If the russians win enough medals, they can melt it down into small chunks and throw it to poor people!  Those damn greedy canadians....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
haha thats the best joke list i've seen in a long time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Legolas, it think there are a lot of different perseptions of eleves. You may think their tall and beautiful, where as a lot of other people think that their short little lepricons that run around stealing your things. It's all  a matter of opinion. Like Histronic said, their not even real. I personally like the eleves in FFXI, but who says that their right?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah hey, you posted this twice. And when I go to the page, there's nothing there. Where area all the pictures?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Eao, you're having problems with your FTP stuff? PM me and tell me what's up, and maybe I can help you out.And you can't see anything? Ah...my friend was having this problem too. My site uses floating frames, so if your browser doesn't support them, then you wont see anything. Damn that. I don't know to much HTML, but I'm going to try and find an alternative to that problem. Sorry!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You going to bring the Earth Clan back too?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ha ha! Good idea Hist. But hey, since when was the Olymics about the welth of your country? And winning medals doesn't get you any money anyways. It just get's you...some medals. And it's not like I have anything against the Russian skaters. They did do good, just not golden good.

Sonic's gone to GameCube, Ecco's gone to PS2.

o_o;;;*commence bitch mode on legolas*WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!? those are elves, no one ever EVER says bad stuff about whitefins drawings! They're a hulluva lot better than you could do i bet! oh boo hoo, you think the anatomy is slightly off, well, go cry me a river cuz no one gives a damn about wat you think!*gasp*... evil:

Yeah my fave is the 4th too. I gotta remember a couple of them so I can tell off a couple of boys who really ticked me off...

*whimpers and hides behind raging Trelli-sis* They're using Legolas against me!    *stays hidden* Like Mi-Mi said - Elves are fantasy creatures. THats like walking up to the emperor of china and saying that his dragons are wrong because they have no wings. Point made! *coughhacksniffle* I'm just glad everybody else saved me the effort on typing back an insult- too sick to think of one.

Hey...Assholer...It seems that you have no sense of humor, he and I were merely joking. As for the russians not winning golden "ly" I beg to differ.If any of you want to play a highly humourous and good as game, I reccomend Dink Smallwood.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh sure - give Vantid a ton of credit (no offfence VanVan - just making a point) and put down my elves. Smart move asshole. Ahem - I will say again because I am boring )

I am sorry if I offended you, but you are both very talented artists, and I shouldnt have critisised your work, because I am hardly as good as you...

Hey...bitch, I didnt knock your drawings just your style, Im sorry if I offended you, and I didnt mean the "bitch thing". I am no artist but I know that short little things that look like leprechauns and run around stealing your things ARE leprechauns!!! DUH!!! 'ahem' sorry To you all...It seems that you have many friends whitefin...but so do I...THE MAFIABwhaahahahhhhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaaha...sorry...you are lcky to have such good friends. (I was joking about the Mafia)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
do not fret, friend Whitefin, i still love your drawings! i can assure you, i could immediately tell they were elves when i first saw those particular works, very nicely done, indeed!    you can certainly draw humanoids a hundred times better than i! in fact, you wouldn't mind if i try to emulate certain characteristics to assist in my human works? everyone here can draw people so well, i am incredibly jealous! keep up the excellent work, my friend, the anthro drawings are absolutely adorable!   and i do hope you feel better soon, Whitefin... i certainly know how that feels *hugs*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey...Bros, I cant see them either, probably a network problem, no biggie.The best site is www.gagooda.com They have cool as ecco pics.

I have the emulator but where can I get ecco 1 for snes?

<div id='container'>
Hey...Kirby. I like no. 11 the best, nice joke. Ill have to put up some too but not now.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*hugs Vantid* thank you once again for this drawing! it is truly amazing! not to mention the one for Swift Current, i just love those wings!   the shine effect on that pic is stunning, just like Whitefin had mentioned! it does look as though i had just taken to the air from a nice swim to check out the tropical forest plants ^_^ the expression and all is quite well done.   and even if your puppy had sat on the pic of blackfox, i am still in awe from it... those wings are just beautiful, and the overall lonely tone of it just emphasizes it. these pictures simply rock, Vantid!   ... and as for your little question on seeing which plants are false, i'd have to mention that i am really not sure... they all look so nice, it would be hard to try and pinpoint and fake ones... if i would have to make a guess, however, i would have to say the orange ones look like the beginnings of a bird of paradise, but the other flowers and ferns look quite valid. but, again, i still love them all! a flight through the tropical gardens, well done!  :D

Ecco was never for the SNES *thwap* :D Its on the Sega Genesis - or to us Australian and PAL users - the Sega Mega Drive. Arkon has all the Emulators and ROMS that you need here for the Ecco Games.

<div id='container'>
Heh! Pod God! Cute! n.n
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well damn legolam if you're going to be an art critic you can at least tell us what you think is wrong with the drawings and how they can be improved, not just hurl abstractions like "the anatomy is off".  The retarded kid that lives across the street from me could give me a better reason for why it looks wrong.  The purpose of the forum is to let artists talk to other artists and trade ideas.  Trust me if we thought our drawings were perfect we would screw around with posting them on a fan site for an obscure video game character.And for the record constructive criticism is allowed so i don't want any of you to go hyper bitch mania just because someone offered some advice.  Especially you whitefin moderators are supposed to be above critics and artists sniping each other like prostitutes fighting for quarters....  While we're on the subject of constructive criticism you should try giving female characters slightly more pointed chins, i think you'll find that to be helpful.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*just death glares Legolas* ...I wouldn't mind at all Neo if you want to emulate some characteristics twisted:

tell me were you always this retarded or did you have an accident with paint chips as a young boy?

well i'm not an expert at this sort of thing but i'd say that we're having a conversation.

wow super sleuth legolam has figured out something we all know!

Heh - thanks for that Hist.. pointed chins.. hm. I fixed up Galacaida a bit - My sister gave me some tips too - so now her neck looks right and you can see her shoulder on her right side a bit more )

LMAO!

O_o;; Um....riiiiiiiiiiight. And that's all I have to say about that.Anyways, AWESOME work, Whitefin!! I love them all!! ^^

<div id='container'>
HA! Funny, Miana! I like #7 the best!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah, that explains why I couldn't get in.  I finally decided maybe I should try reregistering.  So, I did...But, that doesn't answer why I can't upload an avatar anymore.  The only thing I can do is put in a URL for an off-site avatar.  But I don't even know what that means.  How can something have a URL if it's not on a web site?  In any case, I don't remember the URL anyway and I don't rememebr who was hosting it...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The comic idea...not so bad, tho count me out because I can't draw comics, I've tried and failed miserably...But everything you said before that...particularly the "Little Red Riding Hood" thing.....Well, no offense, but I just think it's....really stupid...Don't wanna make anyone mad....it's just my opinion, after all...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Whitefin, I think those are really good.  I didn't see any distinct problems that jumped out at me right away.  Maybe if I looked at them longer I might have seen something, but as faras I could tell they looked really good.  It's really hard to get everything to look right, especially with anatomy.  I think the elves are beautiful.  The only thing I can say is to work on your coloring technique...but I myself am not very good at coloring...I'm working on it, tho.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Crestoes real name is Mario I am Johnny also known as Gianni
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
o.o Those are beautiful.  Very.  Incedible.What media did you use for those anyway?You know, it's funny, because at first I didn't realize Neo wasn't in the water in that one. Guess I'm not very perceptive....-.-;I don't know anything about plants and flowers so I would never be able to tell if any were made up...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Whitefin i think your getting all upset over nothing. If you didn't pay attention to people like him then people like him wouldnt exist!Anyways i did a little research on him and found out he was D-12. The new ban system is very complex which emans if he ever tried to come back under any ip or whatever it would tell me =)I rebanned him and so this topic is over!(Histronic note: I knew it i fucking knew it!  I naturally didnt like him and i even played with the idea that it might be D-12.... i didn't think he'd come back though.  I thought i just didn't like him because he said he was a russian commie ;) )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
you fucking dumbass -_- Nah, off site means its on a different website.  Thats probably the one you should be using.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes tethys i agree and that makes it the right opinion.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes vantid those kick quite a lot of ass.... i'm notinto flowers or anything so i wouldn't know which is made up.   I figured the differences would be apparent, like the flowers in the megadrive sonc games but i couldnt tell O_o  As far as the fox goes.... if you didnt like the wing how come you just didnt erase it and redraw it?  How come finish a flawed picture?  Eraser, girl!
</div>

you can change that, dude

some idiot told me SNES had an ecco game......he said "the cover had a dolphin swimming space"ehhhhhh why!well i guess if you fiddle around enough you can make an Ecco rom to work with an SNES emulator.but now....Ecco may visit Nintento's sysmtms....the new ones..

Hey, I never said I was smart.  I think I've proven myself many times to be a moron..Actually, after I posted that, the thought came to mind that's probably what it means.  But I decided to let someone clarify it for me.  But I still don't understand why I can't upload an avatar now.  And I think it was Shadow that was hosting it before, but I guess he's gone.  And I'm assuming that Tripod won't work with this forum, either, so I'll need someone else to host it if anyone would be so kind.  Buuuttt it's no biggie.

<div id='container'>
Just to let everyone know grey fox legolas and yin and yang are all the same peson as well as Bizzy.Heh you managed to come back through my upgrade but i reenforced all the bans on you. You can trie all you want to get through but everytime you do your live span grows shorter to the point where you will eventualy no longer exist.My friend say good bye!

<div id='container'>
Hey, where'd my other post go?  Maybe it's gone because I wasn't logged in?Well, as I said before, i'm sure I've seen that somewhere before.

 As you know Yang or as many of you may know him as D-12 as been arrested for trying to hack into a web site so know he is in jail for 2 years!!    That bastard is gone, but his old "friend" Grey fox is still out there and he is trying to make it seem like I am on his side

Hey! The forum colors suddenly changed on me!er...Cool, Doom!  )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*oogles all the replies* rrrrllll. ok.legolas....i know i have talent hun but honestyly..whenever i draw something good, it feels like a fluke. you just dunno how many times i drew both of them before i got a pose i liked. im NOT EVEN FUCKING trying to get more attention by saying what i draw sux. for one thing, i said the SCAN sucked. the SCAN. as for swifty's pic, i truly am not satisfied w. that left wing. i reall do not lik eit. but i was going to try and work on it in the hopes of making it looked like i wanted it when a giant moose clawed it. Neo: yes! yer correct bout the orange ones. they are birds of paradise. very good! i suppose now that everyone has had a chance to see, ill say which is which. the orange one of course, the white one on top (a begonia or a ginger...cant remember which) the red ones (haliconious or something wierd like that) the purple ones, and there is also some eucalyptus (sp?)Thethys~~prismacolor color pencils! and on neo's pic, some white gel pen ink for all those stipply shiny dotsHis--&gt;dude, you cant erase colored pencil very easily, trust...i had already erased the wings once and redrew them. but...i was the lazy one who didna draw the wings on a seperate peice of paper first adn then transfer them.i think that covers everyone....
</div>

<div id='container'>
But how do I do that anyway?  I can't find anything, and I always click the thing that says to log on every time I visit.  Maybe it was really because AOL lost connection...

Alright dolph whats the propable solution? i tried to debate this with him before. the picts of the covers we can have but those scans were taken from his site and were scans he did himself. its obvious they were the scans he made. i made a decision like this before which involved scans i took from him. long time ago when i started my scans section i took two scans from his site. im allowed to keep them cause i asked him for them. if we keep those scans i get banned from coh along with you and once again were in a website war we can't possibly do. sure i could beat there site i proved that already but...if i can get those same scans scanned by someone else them i can host them.i talked with you about this already cally but its alright...im not pissed at you. id like to have those scans too but we need another source then psysonic. if we can get that then who gives a shit about if he has jap cover scans and doesnt want us to have them. as lnog as the scans belong to us. i dont care whos the source too. i dont are if we make someone else mad but psysonic is our friend. so i think we should respect him as one. the ecco community is small (except for me of course) but....we cant stomp on the little guy...this site functions better without wars and shit.
</div>

Maybe i can contribute them. I have both 1 and 2 and the sega cd version of 1. But those things are easy to find, but i'll see if i can scan them tomorrow, I just wish I had my own scanner, I think I'm getting my friend angry over here. But aw well, i'll see wht I can do.
</div>

*fumes* Listen here Arkon, I have had it up to here about this now! Why is it that no matter waht most of us do to gelp this site along we get it thrown back in our faces?! I scored the PAL DoTF, Ecco PC, Mega CD, and Jap covers from my good friend James! He is a collector of rare Sega items that you can rarely get now.  The rest of them I found with a god-damed-fucking search engine! WHY DOES THIS WHOLE THING REVOLVE AROUND YOUR GOD-DAMNED MIND! I am not trying to get us into a war, or get your ass banned, I found most of those scans - the others where in the section previously, and I got the rest from my friend James, read and weep. I'm sorry if i've offended anyone, but I am tired, I am upset, i am sore, and I am angry that what work I did has now been locked away. Screw it...

FINALLY.......I've had one this morning, before I woke up...trully weird one DOTF" (I don't remember if it was either DC, or PS2 ver.  like, he is aboard this spaceship and all around him were the "Crash Bandicoot" type of crate things (those breakable wooden boxes). It was in 3D of course.....I only remember swimming around, and charging at them.... and right after that, my dream ends cry:

I did some Ecco dreams during vacations...First one I played a level in 2D. I dived, and there were crabs and rocks who fell on Ecco. At surface, there was a palett bug, because the sky was white, and the water was red.(WOW !!! Look ! It's my 600th message !!!  :D )

Well, seems like someones locked my wooden hole transmitter topic so I gonna have to create a new test of organised empty carrots as to redeem past memories with Dolphin Girl and co.   So anyways I smelt the green triangles and they told me "NO! THERE ARE NO DICTIONARYS! IT ISN'T TUESDAY!"I was frialeded and decided to take refuge between 5 plump fingers that had been mashing away at passing sound rythms.Within 3.34.354665.yellow.237 seconds I was found beyond the realms of matter meating and into the 5th legacy of fold. Imaginly I pulled the rip cord and the baby shouted penguins from his ears until the elastic snapped. Crankels. As you can imagine, we weaseled away and covered the castle in fruit pastels. The Beginning?

I've been debating with myself weather I should get Ecco when it comes to the PSX2 or not. I do think it's a really cool game, and I love the graphics and stuff, but I'm not sure if it would be worth it for me. I already know from playing it at Delphi's that I really suck at it, because the only games I'm really good at are RPG's. But I don't own a Dreamcast, so I haven't really played it all that much.Could anybody tell me if it would be a good buy for a Final Fantasy junky like me? I don't want to pay $80 just for the nice backgrounds, so would I be able to actually play it without Delphi's help to much?I know I don't even have a PSX2 yet, but I will get one eventually. ^_^ So what do you think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
why not it has new things in it, plus it give you a reason to play ecco again! and if an ecco two comes out it will hold you up till then so why not?

Just out of curiosity, what's everybody's favorite music? What bands do you like? What music style? What kind of music do you dislike? I'm bored so I'll tell you all what I listen to...prepare to be terrified. XDOk...here we go. Stuff I listen towink Country, 70's and 80's rock, soft rock, easy listening, pop for the most part...i.e. Back Street Boys and Brittany Spears. Hawiian music or German Om-pap-pa crap... &gt;_&lt; (This is not meant to offend those who do like any of this stuff,  just my opinions and tastes after all.)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
id say buy it, mostly cuz i bought a dreamcast for ecco.  go ahead and blow yer money, you can always get it back later. B-sides, ecco is a cool game just to jump around and enjoy scenery and junk :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
If and when it comes out in North America, it's gonna be at the top of my "Must Buy" list. My bro has a PS2, he had a DC to, and I had Ecco DoF for it...but it died so I can't play Ecco on it anymore. Next best thing is to get the PS2 version when it comes out.

<div id='container'>
i certainly feel that it would be worth it, Doomtrain, i've always found ecco games to be quite enthralling and challenging...   i, myself, shall definitely get the new DoF for ps2... i would like to compare the differences between the DC and ps2 versions and see if they make it any better or worse... not to mention i can add it to my ecco game collection! :D    anyway, i would suggest looking into getting it... i suppose it could not hurt, i mean, if you are not into the challenging gameplay you could still swim around and leap from the water to perform tricks and just basically be a dolphin, that's what i did in DC's DoF. luckily, someone else beat DoF before me and allowed me to copy their file... so now i can play and jump about in every level!    it is really not that comparable to RPGs, unfortunately, i suppose it is more of a selective gaming taste... i saw the reviews for it on IGN, and... well... let us say they were a bit less than kind in grading for our fine finned friend... a 6.5 out of 10, i believe it was, which is less than the 9 it received for the DC version. still, that will not deter me from getting it!

Lemme seeGorillaz, Linkin Park, Daft Punk, Staind, Blink 182, Alien Ant Farm, Puddle of Mud, Kid Rock, most of the New Rock stuff I like. And this may scare some people but I do listen to  country music (once in a blue moon) I like instrumental, and anything with a good beat.Music I don't like: Rap, I really do not like anything from that genre, but I can stand it to a point. I like Missy Eliot and Eve though... but just a few of their songs. That's basically me.

Cool pic, Trel!Of course, I myself don't really give a hoot about the Olympics.  I generally don't really give a crap about anything that has anything to do with sports.  It's just not my thing.

Really? Prismas?How can people do that with colored pencils?  I just can't understand it.  I really wish I knew how to do that.

hold on, there are canadians in the winter olympics? who would have thought? XD  just kidding, i love the drawing there, Trellia, your wrinkle effects on the pants are really nice!     i guess i just kind of faded out of the games after... well, the opening ceremonies, i suppose... so i'm not too up-to-date with medals so far, but i'm thinking the 157-someodd canadian athletes that are in there are doing a great job so far! again, excellent drawing of canadian support for the olympics!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah I like Our Lady Peace (canadian group no less.. XD). My favorite cd of theirs is Spiritual Machines. My favorite song from them is "Are You Sad?" From the S.M.  cd. ^__^

Ugh...you guys are gonna make fun of me, but what the hey.I haven't even heard of many of the groups that you guys have listed so far.  And I'm not really sure what techno is.As for who I like, I don't think I could come up with a complete list.  My favorite singer is Mariah Carey.  I also like Jewel and Shakira and BNL and Matchbox 20 and Janet Jackson and Train and LFO and...um...there's a lot more that I can't think of now...I like mostly soft rock and I like pop rock.  I like a lot of instrumentals, and I like classical but I almost never listen to it.  And..sometimes I like some other stuff, depending.  Oh, yes, I like new age stuff, like the things that have nature sounds in the background and are supposed to be relaxing--because, at least for me, it is relaxing.  But I don't listen to that very much.Most of the time I can't stand rap, but I do like Will Smith and I like some of the milder stuff.  I can't stand hard rock and heavy metal.  I don't like most 80's.  And I don't like country, but I can at least tolerate it more than the other stuff I mentioned.  I can't stand Britney Spews or any of those "boy bands" (the Backstreet Boys are the worst of them as far as I'm concerned).  That's about it.

okay, this is a quick sketch of a character from my story of the Star-Gazer Clans.  his name is Professor Scyfin (more or less pronounced like 'siphon'), the ship's resident Star-Gazer biologist and chemist. he was a quick in-class sketch using Vantid's 6-step dolphin drawing tutorial and incorporating a bit of technology inspired from Atla (thank you so much for coming up with that idea, Crestoe!)  //arkonviox.com/user/trelliasbay/scyfin.jpg(thank you so much for hosting this guy, Trellia! ^_^)

Hey, whoa Neo! That looks awesome! He looks like an enjoyable old character, and I can't wait to see more! Have you gotten a scanner now, or was that done by someone else? I hope you got a scanner because I really enjoy your pictures. Your style is very lovable! Keep up the great work!!!
</div>

<div id='container'>
Yeah, go Canada! That picture looks awesome Trell! And an excelent show of support! Do you color those yourself on the computer? Cause it looks wicked! What program do you use? Your very good at it. I love the work! You should send it into somewhere...some olympic site. I sent my picture of Jamie Sale and David Palltier into goldmedalcanadians.com, and it's going to get passed onto them. You could send it into there with your best wishes, because hosestly it's great! Kepp up the good work, and Whitefin too!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I'm mostly into the old stuff (that some of you said you didn't like) Blink 182, Janet Jackson, Missy Eliot, Our Lady Peace. I do like rap as long as it has a good beat. There are a few country songs and singers I like. Classicle is always good for relaxing, but pop and boy bands are always only bad for you. I don't like pop. I wish I could find video game sound tracks, because I would listen to them all the time. But I can't find anything hear. I like soul, RnB, and some good ol' techno dance shit. I would like heavy metel music...if it weren't for those guys with long greasy hair (that look like they got in a fight with a nail gun) screaming their faces off! The sound track to Guilty Gear is a great heavy metel track, without the yelling.But yeah...mostly the oldies stuff.

I'm probly the oddest person here - honostly!!I mostly listen to an incredible amount of game music. I never stray far without my MP3 disk that has Sonic - Final Fantasy - Biohazard (Resident Evil) - Remixes - Crono Trigger - and other game things on it. I also tend to fall in love with a heavy amount of Classical and Ambient music. Mostly classical. The reson I like alot of classical is because it is so damned inspiering.. each piece paints a picture in your mind to every note. Ambient stuff.. whooooo yeah! I like listening to alot of ambient musics when i'm sick because its so calming. Then I have a dark side &gt;D. Go Me!.Other than that - I most just listen to Game music - with some weezer here and then. I DISLIKE alot of bands like Linkin Park for a few of thier songs. Not because some of them are offensive - but all they normally are is just alot of distortion and overdrive guitars and screaming. o.o;;

is the GBA gonna be a differnt ecco story?  We need ROMS!  what about um..........An offical Ecco RPG.........if two companieys converged for one progect, shook hands and made an ecco rpg..........although the ocen is large land adventure seems to be 'better', but what if Ecco and friends got transformed into humans for the middle half of the game or somthing, and after being dolphins find that they have to do more than turn back to dolphins. *shrugs* but influencing companiys for ideas is illegal..........to protect both parties.  more illegal is to tell them what to do with there property...

Well, I'm still writing the fanfic, so don't think that during all of the confusion of the community being screwed by YABB and Shadow leaving that I've become idle and forgot about it! Unfortunately, I'm going to have to get info about everyone again, so those who wanna be in it will have to re-post their character information. I'm on chapter three, and me, Kitnee and Doomtrain are leaving Atlantis to defeat the new Foe on Earth. Where did they come from? How did they get past the Guardian?Well, it goes like this. I realised that when Ecco travelled through time, and defeated the Foe, it was in another timeline. Hence, the Foe still exist in Ecco's true world.Now supposing when he blew up the Foe ship, which caused the Globes to be lost in the first place, some of the Foe inside survived. On Earth, they began to multiply, keeping themselves concealed, into the thirtieth century when Ecco is around. Ecco saves the reality, and the Foe on Earth, now in their thousands, begin to invade. It is ten years after Ecco's journey, and the new quest is laid in the hands of Tidesinger.What ya think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm gonna put them in a gallery of generic face picts =)

Well... if you ask Doomtrain or Jader I have the worst tastes in music  8O But here we go...I like that New Age stuff that plays music to nature sounds, such as dolphins, whales, a forest... so on. Music like this takes up most of my CD collection. Like Vantid, I own (thanks to Doomtrain) and really like the "Angels of the Sea" one.I LOVE video game music, especially Ecco's, Final Fantasy's, the music from the Sonic games, the Resident Evil games have some cool music in 'em, too (such as the music from the Private Residence in Code Veronica), I always loved the soundtrack to Phantasy Star 4, and if I met the person who composed the soundtrack for Skies of Arcadia I'd kiss the ground they'd walk on. There are also some songs from animes that I like, too (the opening to 'Serial Experiments Lain'. Awesome song!)As for stuff with actual lyrics ;)Old stuff Savage Garden would have to be one of my favorite groups out of the scene nowadays. I have Colette Baron Reid's CD, Magdalene's Garden (and I LOVE it). I like some of Enya's stuff (Sail Away, mostly), and Madonna's not all that bad, either (especially Ray of Light). I was a huge fan of that damn song by Lou Bega, 'Mambo No. Five" (still am). I like the music they use in Riverdance. I don't LOVE all techno music, but I own the soundtrack to Swordfish and like some of Delerium's stuff.I also like some classical stuff, mostly Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Pachelbell's Kanon (the best song EVER, in my opinion).Anyway, there's my two cents.

Interesting thoughts cause that could make alot of sense for what a sequel to defender of the future could be about. Although im too fancisnated with my idea of the Mutaclone following Ecco back and that Ecco actualy defeated one of his clones.I can't wait to see if a second Ecco comes out, BTW shadow hasn't relly gona anywhere hes still in the chat room. I'm gonna talk him into working with us again and also talk another individual who many know into working with us.Oh tidesinger i have a treat for you, you'll see as soon as i finish posting this message.

I can't believe I'm here, but I'm not complaining! Ah, so what we up to? I'm still writing my fanfic, by the way. If you think I should post what I've done so far, then let me know. (I'll put it up on a webpage, maybe)
</div>

<div id='container'>
Oh, kool! I see what you mean  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
 Ahh yes. Nice of you to notice Arkon. It is I. And I thought that since I had to re-regester anyway, why not match the new forum with a new identity?   But I am confused as to why my facepic is not displaying.   (Love the new smileys)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*stares at delphi* you have the angels of the sea CD? w. the spotted dolphins cover and it has about 12 mins of surf sounds at the end and bird sounds and stuff? do you know i would kill for that cd? ive only got the tape cuz well...i got it when i was in jr high and i had hardly any money and the tape was way cheaper than the cd.i would give people drawings if i got that cd. hell id draw whatever they wanted.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
haha arkon, you told me you had a new girlfriend every week and you dumped them when you got sick of them
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yes arkon but don't let facts get in the way of good funI'm Histronic and its my job to point out other peoples stupidity and mistakes with sarcasm and pointless bitching.... and i also am an enforcer so remember no retarded shit around me  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
If you just let trellius talk for a bit you can figure out who he is no matter what his current name is
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
great i love a happy ending
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
really arkon does it work very well?  New emulators like the advance ones usually are very primitive.... it will play ecco all buggy.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Interesting but i think it would be more interesting if we made a fic about the forum, using the forum metaphor to create a world.  Where Histronic the enforcer beats the shit outta little kids with his nightstick.... i'll probably regret even bringing this point up after i calm down -_-  Oh wait i remember we have one of those already, its called the blundercaves.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well said cresty!  *LOCKED*

Stumpy is good for nonviolent characters.... in fact, it reminds me of arkonviox's dolphin nerd, Atla.  Even though atla has cool hair.
</div>

<div id='container'>
*snipes out original message* i said sumfin dumb.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
haha *pokes vantid with his enforcer cattleprod* knock it off there....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well every genre has at least one song i like, even country can have superior lyrics like "here comes johnny hes got his pecker in his hand he's a one balled man and he's off to the rodeo..." heh heh  But the bands who can deliver good music time after time are , disturbed, green day, ramstein, mushroomhead, dope, ozzy and the black sabbath, godsmack, and my favorites are union underground, powerman 5000, metallica (napster nazis), offspring, and static x.

And offspring r sweet too ^_~gah, i forgot i love to listen to VG musik too, hehe, the DOTF music is sweet, but i love listening to my collections of ecco gym's whitefin gave to me ^_^ *clings* that wat im mostly listening to on the computer, unless i've got a CD in it..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Here's true storyMy bro and I are driving down the road, the windows are down and we pull up to a stop. My brother turns his cd player on and the next thing I hear is "What's my name mother*******!"  And to make it worst the car next to us had a group of old people in it.   Hehe it was embarrassingBut the Gorillaz are a good band, alot of different styles and awesome beats. Anyone hear the jamaican remix of Clint Eastwood? It kicks ass, despite not understanding a word Russ is saying.... at least I think it's him singing.

Uhm... Eao are you ok?Ah hem, seems that Vantid and Whitefin furgot about me too. True I don't have much art for Ecco, can't draw dolphins. And I drew a group of dolphins on the blackboard using Vanny's tips and someone said the dolphin looked f*cked up. That killed my artistic talent for about a week.  
</div>

I like 2 pac, eminem, d12, NWA (niggaz with attitude, includes dr.dre who was in another favorite of mine, the world class wreckin crew) linkin park, limp bizkit, puddle of mudd, nickleback, the lics with xzibit, royce tha 59', Knoc-turn'al, Jadakiss, Dmx, Busta Rhymes, P.

I also enjoy symphony music and so on. I dont like techno, country, and rap thats about having lots of money and having more money than everyone, witht he exception of cash and money millionaires. i like SOME of their shit, but others i cant stand. And i only like sertain techno thats in games. thats it. And i hate Everlast from the House of pain, them too, i also dont like Mobb Deep, who has heart problems and also said fuck 2 Pac. Hez a bitch, i hope he has a heart attack.  Everything in pop, except things that might be considered pop in my favorites list above, Trent Wazner (or whatever that fags name is), I like metallica but i dont like Lars the drummer. And anything else i cant think of rght now.Theres a bunch missing, ill add later. :P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
okay, i'll take a shot at this topic then...   i'm not much of a music buff, but i'll see what i can think of... i am mainly a techno lover *snickers at Trellia*, and it seems as though it can be contagious! i love certain groups like Daft Punk, but usually i do not recall many of the artists who do my favorite songs...    i like some ambient and trance, like Robert Miles and DSFX with sleep mix, but mainly i'll go towards anything with a decent beat. i'm a fan of the 80s since i grew up to most of that music. i'm a major fan of video game music, especially ecco music, the two posted up in the archives being a couple of my personal favorites. i'll sway towards a bit of pop, as long as it has a good beat, but i'd rather listen to it than actually having to see the singers... *shudders at brittany spears movie*... that's just disturbing... i think we should draw the line somewhere on that...   i also have a few dolphin song CDs... Call of the Dolphin, Pacific Blue, and Ocean Symphony... they're nice to just hang out and listen to, but i like Pacific Blue best of all... to me there is nothing like the haunting echo of orca calls during a rainstorm.    well, all i can think of for now... i'm going to have to get my flippers on a certain Lassen CD, though ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Shadow, my friend! it is good to see that you have returned! i do hope that you plan to stay aboard for a while now, i know we'd all hate to lose such a person with the ability to locate such 'fascinating' topics to share with us all.  :D  welcome back to the insanity!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Leave me alone Hist, it's late and I really don't give a shit whether I censor the damn thing or not...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Neo, Three words: Paul Van Dyk;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aaaa *gets pounced* Hi Trellia :) Yeah I plan to stick around.Neo, I'll for sure have to cook up some really tasteless topic to post, it'll take a while though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oops, I forgot some stuff. I listen to New Age (a lot more then than now), Nature stuff like Solitudes, LOTS of stuff with dolphins and whale sounds in it. And Celtic stuff to! Sarah Brightman's La Luna is a cool cd. I got Loreena McKennett's The Book of Secrets, which is my favorite of hers. And Enya's an old standby. Solitudes did a celtic cd, "Celtic Awakening" which was real nice. I also like some classical, like Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Wagner's Ride of the Valkeries. There's also Hall of the Mountian King, and others who's names escape me at the momoent. XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
EEEeeee! New NeoEcco art!!  That's so cool!  ^____^

<div id='container'>
Mr. Tree is back....Tiamat...ain't that a kind of dragon?  You scared me for a second...I thought you were a freek from #Draconic's IRC channel*shudders* Polygamuras pedohiplistic bisexual anythingphilesm dragons....the'll yiff there babies the second they hatch....*chuckles* Yes, we know about "those dragons", hehehe ;)In Akkadian, Tiamat is the mother of the gods and consort of Apsu. (Apsu is the father of the gods.) Its generally thought that Apsu represented the fresh water of the earth, while Tiamat was a representation of the oceans.If you think about the origins of Akkadian, this will make much more sense.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Trellius is a mother! heh *notices a new name changing coming up*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What the hell is Akkadian?I've heard of Tiamet, but it was on Golden Sun.   : Oh well, this will hafta do
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Trace kyshad is a traitor on owr site...something happened between him and I, I am not to happy about. But i am a big fan of his music
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Akkadian is an ancient branch of the Semitic languages. Also called Assyro-Babylonian, was current in ancient Mesopotamia (now Iraq) from about 3,000 B.C. until the time of Christ. The earliest surviving inscriptions in the language go back to about 2,500 B.C. and are the oldest known written records in a Semitic tongue.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Cool. Thanks for bringing this to our attention Arkie.  :D Yay! Now I'll be able to play Ecco again! Ewww...that's gonna be interesting with the PS controller... o_O;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome back! I'm happy to see that your going to stick around. ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tiamat was a dragon godess was it not? Who was slane to create the earth, stars, and universe in general?Many of us also know that name from the Aeon in the Final Fantasy games. Tho' THAT Tiamat is clearly masculine in oragin. XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tiamat! Yeah! From Final Fantasy!!! Weeee!Welcome back Tiamat! Nice to have you back on the board!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Shadow! Glad to see your back! This board just isn't complete without you, so stick around. We're always glad to have ya.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm...I'm still wondering...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah, Tidey...thanks for encluding me in the story! I'm really honourd! I can't wait until it's done! Now I'm looking forward to two ecco fics...Delphi's and Tidesigners. There both going to be great for sure!And hey, I see your blue stipe. Looks good! ^_^ You know what, now that I've had more practice with dolphins, I'm going to try and re-draw that pic I did for you and Kitnee. It can be a little fanart for your story from me!So keep workin on it! It's going to be great!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I forgot about La Luna. I have that one, too. I love the way she does "Here With Me", and I personally like it better than the way Dido does it.Yeah Van, I have the CD thanks to Doomtrain. She gave it to me (among others). You could just burn it like Eao said...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey you, Delphi. Ok, so maybe I'm not as bad as I think, but when I look at my links and Vantid, I can't help but think I am. I'm sure we can all realate to that. Like Swifty and Neo and all you guys! I admire you guys!!!Anywho...I've made my second update. I've had lots of time to draw since the teachers are on strike. So ta-da!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh, yeah I gave Delphi a whole pile of those nature CD's. I lost taste for them, even though they were very realaxing. Sorry Vantid, Delphi beat you to the rush. Plus, you know, you don't live anywhere near me. A reason I can't burn it for you. But otherwise I would have. ^_^ Sorry!
</div>
<br />

Heh, i liked it. Especially the red prawn, good job Ark! One of my favorites that you did.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I like that New Age stuff that plays music to nature sounds, such as dolphins, whales, a forest... so on. Music like this takes up most of my CD collection. Like Vantid, I own (thanks to Doomtrain) and really like the "Angels of the Sea" one.Um.... Delphi...... 'bout that "Angels of the Sea" one: (is it really good) wish I could have it. You might be interested in the one that I have...... It's called "Gentle Giants of the Sea".
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*LMFAO* Hahahaha!! I made a debut... for a few seconds &gt;D I like how you named Samwise and Frodo D.Again good job - keep up the good work! :)

<br />

<div id='container'>
Oooohhh! TLK - Rythem of the Pridelands! I've got that and I love alot of the stuff on it! D I have a really beautiful CD. Ian Cameron Smith's Lunar Reflections. Uses a fair bit of guitar works - alot of keyboard pads and such - so damned beautiful. Once I get an MP3 ripper for mac that I dun have to pay 200 bucks for i'll rip some stuff for people.

<div id='container'>
It was definitely a bit out there, but it didn't have as many of the smartass saying like from arkon-brand blundercaves.  Like hell isn't so bad when prawn took over.  But my favorite was the one where history lizard and blackfin go to sonc hq.  Even though i died -_-
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds great, Tidey! I'll have to scrounge up the info on Kitnee again. I lost it when YaBB went bye-bye.

Uh right O_o

well i've noticed that emulators have problems with specific games, like the water in sonic games and so on.  They usually dont know things like this are gonna happen until after the games out, so if ecco has any problems, they'll have to be fixed in a later version of the emulator.  Besides, look at genecyst - its older than god and it still can't do sonic game water
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
cool.... very trellia like
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
theres a link to xtremecco!  And the description is a lot better than arkons, too, which is something along the lines of "this site supposedly has ecco animated gifs.... cool."  In fact i think that may be too many adjectives.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ooh, me likes tons! ^.^

Actualy histronic that was me who locked most of them topics.I was trying something new vantid i seen on another website. The admins would lock any topic that went off topic and ask the users to make new ones if they wanted to talk about something new. But...being that this isnt any other website i'll take a break from all the topic locking. I kinda see your point so you won't have to worry now =)If anyone has concerns let me know~
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'll trie to take your advice hist its been a while since ive done a blundercaves thats why it wasnt like any other one i ever done!Sad to say unlke the undercaves days there isnt relly anyone to be pissed at. Psysonic doesnt relly count since his website wasn't comparable to mine like the undercaves. And he isnt as good of a bad guy as blackfin was hes like a bad guy lackey...teams up with anyone who like to destroy me.Thats where all the fun of making these comes from =) heh
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Just to give away me little secreat i asked blackfin to co admin with me. He declined but the truth is i dont relly care shadows more cooler anyways!Anyhow it's good to say i don't think many sites have a good admin team like owrs does!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
AH! Trellia! Your site is wicked! And I love your drawings too, there very cute and always enjoyable to look at! I totally love it all! Go girl, keep up the awesome drawings!And your site also lead me too Whitefins, who's art is equaly is great! Your both awesome! And I want to give both of you a big huge thanks  for linking me! The kind gesture is very much appritiated! I think I'll have to return the favour soon. ^_^Keep it up both of you!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
People might wonder why porpose girl dies all the time.The answer...she is like kenny from south park! and also in real life i always get into fight with her. but shes my best friend =) heh maybe to do her a favore i could have her kill me! but if i get killed that means the bludnercaves is over!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah but considering how many emus are out for genesis im sure you'll find one that can play the game correctly. Besides who the hell wants to go and buy a game boy advance? it sounds nice but for one game come on!thats why the world of emus is a world of kings
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh i put that description hist cause at the time you werent around...or maybe it was ...because you dont update your damned website!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I know but i locked a few tooAnd since when do you act like other websites?  Other websites are fucking pansies.  But when someone says "*hits you with cement bisquit*" its time to lock the fucking thing and punish the offender with a temporary ban.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yes well the world of kings can suck my left nut because there is something wrong with all of my emulators.... must be the sedimentary layer of viruses my computer has gotten ofer the years and the newest version of mcaffe can't get rid of.  Of course it beats getting a gba since its nintendo and its suckiness will be proven one day....  at least there dont seem to be any new pokemon titles in the works. -_-;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
O_o but you're immortal.  I thought porpouisegurl was a kenny but shit everyone dies and comes back to life on the blundercaves.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
haha i thought about updating it but nah.  If i did something new youd probably steal it ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Actually atla is my favorite character.  it used to be verinunius but i'm not exactly sure what the hell he is anymore....

I second vantid's request. Note at the bottom of your mod panel, theres a button maked "Split", which you can use to break of the off-topic part and move it into a new topic thread, if its really required.

Rythem of the pridelands is music inspireed by the film, most of the songsare in Zulu or somthig...english or a mixKube or how ever it's spelt is a song i despise.....one reason is my mom likes it and her music is ickley (Poi dog pondering, From good homes) so Historic could be called rasiest like the schools that only teach French, Spanish, German and leve out Japnese, Russian, Zulu, Cat, Finnish (is that a lanuage?) obscure language here.*nods* The broadway play took the melodies from the movie that Rythem did and added words, total blasphmay on TLKoB's partlea Halalea was beter than "shadowlands"  'lala" was better than "endless night"'specialy the one line.  mabye I use it as my sig insted of this one.  Atma/Ultma weapon's is cool....the "i have found and answer" one.moosickwhatta bout "elevator music"? evil no?  Childrens songsI'd like to see oversexed, ultra volient drug indorsed rapish-rock music but sung in children (child-like)voices and with dinnglie 'cutie' insturmentsthat would be funnyor Christan music done to deathmetal-like tones and volume.and Punk rap 'values' and content done to whiney countrey music ways of music.this is what the world needs.think i gota watch To Kill a Mocking bird now.

many thanks, everyone! i had no idea that so many would actually like/respond to my little sketch there ^_^ i truly feel honored by your compliments...doomtrain do you really think he'd be good in color? i was just thinking of fixing up some details on him and leaving him the way he is in sketch form... but i think color would be nice, if i ever get some of my other projects complete i'll remember to do that  actually, i like that idea! i'll have to try that out, plushi-fying some of my story dolphins with suitable and distinguishable characteristics... the lab coat would be a perfect touch for ol' scyfin!

Now I found something interesting. In the starting point of Ecco II's City of Forever level there is a glyph behind Ecco. I have no idea what it does in the Mega CD/PC versions.. but when you sing to it in the English Genesis game - it is a blank screen. I went into the Jap game and sang to it.. Now I have a message that I need to translate.(Please note I may have misjuged some spaces by pure accident)Topiraha(may be a 'wa') Kareraniyotte HirakaremasuKarera o('wo') Okoraseteha(again may be a 'wa') IkemasenShizukani oto o('wo') Tsuiteiu no desu.If anyone has knowledge of Japanese - please do chip in an help translate this. It may end up being a useless message - but I really want to work out what it says - because that may clue together the puzzle of it not being in the english version. ~Whitefin

hmmmm my mom sez my blood type is O, i did an Engrem personalty test (or somthing) and I came up with the persona of "the romanitc" (a friend had a premination i was that tpye) and  my maped out star chart hads prof to it.sad thing is i don't how how I would be with relationships because people don't want me, and i cannot desire everyone I look at.so these girls must be sick whores to be used for a week and be deserted, but then cry about what happned like the twits they are.I still cannot move my attachment away from the fucknut Tom....i wish I could....mabye it's OCD......mabye I'm a rare person who would't desert somone.  then again a negitive side to my sign is that I'm posive, then i'd treat them like ownable objects.*shrugs* I almost understand the mantality, using a girl then geting a fresh one after the week is over....from your minds....understanding sucks and is worthless, hate and assumptions are best to liveby.  less pain

Okay, gang. Here are the first free chapters of my fanfic. I posted them to Arkon to put up in the fanfic section, but I don't think he's got it up yet. Anyways, I got some more writing to do, but post in and let me know what you think so far... Enjoy!  :D Chapter OneIt was a beautiful day in the waters of Suffolk, near the UK. The sky was blue, the ocean calm. It wasn't apparent of the imminent danger facing the world.It is the thirtieth century, and five hundred years before, dolphin and man had started working together, and had lived in peace and harmony, creating an almost perfect world, known as the Golden Age. Dolphins were incredibly intelligent, and had long concealed their sentience from man. Then, five hundred years ago, they revealed themselves...They had both worked together, and eventually extended their reach beyond our solar system and offered peace and friendship to all who would welcome it.However, there was a species to whom aggression was the highest calling....Creatures known only as the Foe watched the Earth with an envious eye, for Earth was a prize without equal. Ages ago, the Foe came close to conquering all, but dolphin and man brought their age of conquest to an end. Reduced to near-destruction, the Foe probed Earth for a moment of weakness...But the few caretaker dolphins who stayed behind were not defenceless. The Guardian, their greatest creation, shielded them with its immense power. It would draw on the Earths power to place a force field around the planet, rendering Earth indestructible.     It was in this time of crisis that a dolphin called Ecco lived. He had defeated the Foe, when they once managed to destroy the Guardian and alter Earths past, stopping the monumentous event that brought humans and dolphins together. Ecco had travelled to Atlantis, and was pulled through the time rift when the Foe invaded. He battled through alternate time lines, trying to put things back right. He visited Mans nightmare, where Man and the Foe had destroyed each other, and only a few dolphins survived. He travelled through Dolphins nightmare, a time where dolphins ruled the world aggressively, and had wiped out mankind.Finally he travelled to a Earth ruled by the Foe, and there he defeated the Foe queen, and saved his reality.This story is set in Ecco's world, but it is not about the young singer of destiny. This is of another dolphin, and his quest to defeat the next Foe invasion. On his travels he will meet and lose friends, and make enemies of many species, including the Foe. He was Tidesinger, a dolphin bestowed with an unusual power. He didn't know what it was, or how to use it. He just felt it. He knew he had it.And so, it was left to this dolphin, Tidesinger, to protect the Earth and its billions of inhabitants, from the Foe.                                                 Tidesinger swam through the clear waters that surrounded the Old United Kingdom. Of course, it was no longer known as that. It had since been renamed, when dolphin and man began to co-exist. This old country was where the Asterite lived, at least, that was what the rumours said. But no one had ever seen it, save for the great Ecco, although it was believed to exist anyway. Tidesinger was a young dolphin, fifteen years. He jumped and dived, always in a playful mood. He had a blue stripe down both flanks, starting just above a flipper, and ending between his dorsal fin and his flukes.He was a lone swimmer. It wasn't often that he socialised, he only ever had once before. But he had always dreamed of joining a pod, but he had never found one that he really liked, or that he felt attached to. His body was scarred from fights with sharks, although he preferred not to fight them. Only when he needed to would he do so.     Tidesinger swam on, heading nowhere in particular, just enjoying himself as he darted through the fish and explored the ocean floor.      It was a while before he noticed, but he realised the ocean around him was deadly silent. It was creepy, because he could normally hear the smallest of things, but the ocean was silent. He swam to the ocean floor, noticing with some unease that not a creature stirred. In fact, using his echo-location, he soon realised that he was the only creature for maybe miles around.Then he heard something. A shriek, very high pitched, although it sounded quiet, as if from some distance away. Tidesinger didn't know the creature; he could tell from its song. It sang of death and destruction, and great hunger.He got a very bad feeling.He rose to the surface to breath, and he then dived back under, and the wailing shriek was much closer. He saw the creature through his eyes; it was so close that he didn't need to pick it up on sonar.It was black, and resembled an insect in the way that armour plates locked into place around its body. Its head was shaped narrowly, and widened towards the top. It had many tentacles, that snaked around its body as it swam. It glided silently through the water like a wraith, with only the foul shriek revealing its presence.Tidesinger turned tail and powered away as fast as he could. The creature suddenly screamed; it had spotted him. It began to give chase, and it began catching up with the young dolphin.Tidesinger powered his muscles for extra speed, rising to the surface to breathe every so often. He could sense the creature close by, and it scared him.What was it?He was tiring, and the creature was still chasing him. It didn't seem to tire, like the robots man had built centuries ago...He turned, facing the creature. It slowed down, and began moving towards him silently. Tidesinger shivered. It was hunting him.The creature was almost upon him, and Tidesinger prepared to charge it. As he did, the tentacles snaked around his body, trapping him in its clutches. It began to draw him closer, and then he felt a searing pain in his side as something cut into his muscles, spilling warm red blood into the cold waters.He tried pulling away, but the creature had him. He could not move, and he was going to die...He began to get a relaxed feeling, withdrawn from his own body. He felt like he was in a dream, as if it was happening to someone else. He barely noticed the Orca power towards them. It grasped the creature in its teeth and shook it violently. Black blood filled the water, but that was the last that Tidesinger saw. His world seemed to blur, before it finally went black... Chapter TwoHe opened his eyes, slowly, but recoiled as bright sunlight shone into his eyes. When his eyes finally adjusted, he opened them, and to his surprise, right there before him, was his rescuer. He surfaced to breathe, and began thinking of questions to ask the Orca."Ugh..." he said softly, "who are you? What happened?""My name is Kitnee." she replied, "Are you okay? You were attacked by that creature.""Creature...?" he tried to remember what had happened. It was unclear, but he remembered being cut deep along his flank. He craned his neck to look at the wound. It had healed, but had scarred. A long white line ran along his body.Kitnee swam towards him, a little closer. She stopped just before him."So, then. Do you know what it was that attacked you?""No, I don't. Do you?""No. It was your scream that drew me near. You're very fortunate to be here..."Tidesinger paused for a moment, looking at Kitnee."My name is Tidesinger.""Yes, I know that. I have heard of you many times on my travels. You are a great shark-slayer, are you not?""I don't know about great.. But I can hold my own.""You're too modest. You should be proud to be able to fight those things.""But I couldn't fight that creature...""No, you couldn't. But I think I know what it was. If I asked, could you describe it to me?""Yes, I could. Why?""Then we shall request an audience with the great Ecco.""Ecco? Why?""I'm not entirely sure, but I believe that you just faced one of the Foe..."Kitnee began swimming in the direction of Atlantis, and Tidesinger raced after her.                                         Tidesinger had never been to Atlantis before, and he was nervous. Furthermore, he was going to meet the greatest hero the world had known for generations. He also was looking forward to it. Atlantis was said to be a beautiful place, almost totally submerged. Dolphin and man had built it together, on the supposed ruins of old Atlantis, which was swallowed by the sea thousands of years ago...Every now and then he would surface to breathe, but strangely the Orca, Kitnee, never rose for one breath. He decided not to ask about it, so he thought of another question."Have you met Ecco before?"The Orca swam on, and sang back, "I know him very well. We could be called best friends, but we haven't seen each other for a long time.""How long?"I'd say about ten years. I have been busy travelling, seeing the world. That is what brought me along this route. I was going to go to the Arctic, to visit family. But this is much more important.""If that was the Foe, how did it manage to get past the Guardian?""I do not know. But I think we will understand more once we have spoken to Ecco.""Is it much further?" asked Tidesinger."No. About half an hour."Tidesinger jumped clear of the water, exhaling, and took in a lung full of oxygen. He splashed back down beside Kitnee. He could already see the ancient pillars and ruins of Old Atlantis. They were white marble, and bore markings of man and dolphin swimming together. Moss and algae covered most of it, and fish darted in and out of the pillars. It looked and seemed very creepy.Not long after, they swam towards a large island. It had a mountain rising at its centre, and a few buildings were visible above small ridges. Together, the two dolphins swam around the outskirts of the island, before reaching a small bay. Tidesingers echolocation told him that there were two humpbacks, a mother and calf. There was also four dolphins swimming around, playing with each other and splashing on the surface.Kitnee lead him to a stone gate. Engraved above it was a crescent moon, which began to glow as they both approached. It was only then that Tidesinger noticed the crescent moon on Kitnee's head. It too was glowing with a strong golden light. Slowly, with a great scraping sound, the stone doors opened, letting out shafts of light from inside, dazzling him. Temporarily blinded, he used his sonar to follow Kitnee inside. When his eyes adjusted, he could see murals along the walls. They showed a dolphin with stars on its head. Ecco. They showed various stages of his journey throughout time to rescue the globes, each of which represented various traits. Compassion, wisdom, intelligence, humility and ambition. Without these traits dolphins were not complete, and so became enslaved in the world of Mans nightmare. There, Ecco found the globe of ambition and intelligence, and once returned to dolphins, they conquered the Earth and destroyed mankind. What had happened to the Foe, Ecco could not guess, and from the various information he obtained he discovered that The Clan, lead by the evil Mutaclone, was holding the globe of ambition. The resistance led Ecco to the globe of compassion, and then to the clans headquarters. Once he had traversed the hanging waters, he faced Mutaclone himself. Once he was defeated, Ecco retrieved the globe. With four globes returned to dolphins, Ecco was faced with a reality where the dolphins beheld no wisdom. They were easily conquered by the Foe. Ecco had to defeat the Foe Queen to be able to retrieve the last globe. When he had got it, his world was restored.After Tidesinger finished looking at the murals, Kitnee lead him further into Atlantis. It wasn't the age-old Atlantis that was said to have sunk beneath the ocean. It was a new Atlantis, built to be a place of peace and friendship. Here, the Guardian rested, and he had created a crystal statue of Ecco, that emerged from the Guardian itself. It was said to glow the seven colours of the rainbow when the Foe were close by. Still, no one had ever discovered Old Atlantis, as it became known. The ocean had been explored fully, with not any clues, save for the collapsed pillars before the island, which led many to believe that New Atlantis was actually built on the ruins of Old Atlantis, although it had never been proven.They swam on, and Tidesinger began to feel his need to breathe emerging. Through the tunnel they swam, twisting and turning, towards the islands centre. They finally emerged in a wide open space, and Tidesinger burst out of the water and drew a deep breath.He returned to Kitnee's side, and marvelled at the workmanship of the buildings, laced with intricate patterns and murals. There was a deep rift; a slice in the floor that seemed to go down forever, as if a giant had carved into the floor with an immense blade. Towards this they swam, but they turned to the right and didn't go down. There ahead of them was a building. Its foundations sunk into the shallow waters, but it rose above the waters surface by easily nine metres. It was hollow inside, being one great hall, where all the species of New Atlantis would meet.It was then that a rainbow caught Tidesingers eye. It swept through the sky, and as he followed it to the ground, he realised that its end was at the Guardian. The Guardian, right before him, glistened in all of its glory. The crystal statue of Ecco stood proud, but it was then that Tidesinger realised something was wrong. The crystal form of Ecco was glowing, first red, then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. It was pulsing the colours of the rainbow."Kitnee," he began, "Are the Foe close by?""They can't be. The Guardian can detect any Foe ship approaching Earth from millions of miles away." she replied, "If they are approaching, then we'll know soon enough."As she said that, The Guardian became a deep blue, and a huge laser fired from it, which divided in all directions, following the planets surface. Far away, five explosions were heard."I guess they're still trying. They're persistent, I'll give them that."Tidesinger rose to the surface, exhaled, then took in a deep breath. He swam back beside Kitnee."Where's Ecco?" he asked.Kitnee used her echolocation, and began swimming towards The Guardian. There, close by, was a bottlenose, darting among the shoals of fish. Even from a distance, Tidesinger could see five stars on Ecco's forehead, the shape of a constellation in the night sky. As they approached, Ecco paused, then turned their way. He seemed happy to see Kitnee again.As he approached, Tidesinger felt nervous. Ecco was probably the greatest hero of the sea, and yet he seemed so normal, rather than one of the older dolphins who always told their stories so dull and boring."Hello, Kitnee!" he sang at last."Hello, Ecco, champion of the seas!" laughed Kitnee.Ecco laughed, and then his eyes were drawn towards Tidesinger."And who have we here? And with a blue stripe down both flanks?"Tidesinger didn't reply; he was nervous."Ah, you are Tidesinger I presume? Many stories I've heard about you. You would be almost as well sung about throughout the seas as I am, and that's saying something!""He's very modest." Kitnee told Tidesinger in a low whistle.Tidesinger laughed, "So how have you heard of me? What do these stories say?""That you fight with the most feared of sharks, and come out alive. That you explore the most deadly and treacherous caves and caverns in the ocean, and come out alive." Ecco smiled, "You have my respect already." He swam around Tidesinger, and then said, "That is a nasty scar. And no shark bite could ever come close to the severity of that."Kitnee told Ecco of the story behind the creature that attacked Tidesinger, and what had happened."Well, it sounds like the Foe, that's for sure. Can you describe it to me?"Tidesinger shuddered at the memory, then described everything. The armour, the tentacles and the shriek."Yes, it definitely is one of the Foe. Strange that you should meet it in this time, when we are most protected. I wonder how it got past The Guardian?""So do we." said Tidesinger."Well, the first problem is how many Foe are out there?" said Ecco, "Next, we need to put every dolphin on full alert. Maybe now would be a good time....." he broke off, as if in another train of thought."What is it?" asked Kitnee."I'll be right back." answered Ecco, "I need to speak to The Guardian."He swam off, leaving Tidesinger and Kitnee wondering just what he was doing.After a few minutes, he returned. "Can you please come with me?" he asked, "There's something important that you must see."Ecco swam towards the rift that they had seen earlier, and Kitnee and Tidesinger swam closely behind.When they reached the rift, Ecco surfaced to breathe, then dived down. Kitnee followed, then Tidesinger, after first taking a breath. It was deep, and dark. They had to rely on their echolocation to get them through. They eventually reached the bottom, which was filled with fish of different colours and species to which Tidesinger had never before set his eyes upon. And there were jellyfish. Hundreds of jellyfish, that floated gently on the waters current. Through these they swam, before finally reaching a huge hole, that looked as if a great drill had just sunk into the ground. It was neat and round, and there once used to be a strong current flowing from it. That was, until Ecco had crashed a boulder into it. The current had stopped, leading to a small alcove where he had found a shard of The Guardian.They swam down, Kitnee only just fitting. Down they went, and to Tidesinger it felt like forever. He felt his need to breathe, but he fought against it for the moment. Ecco swam on, finally turning right into the small alcove. Then he sang a song, which Tidesinger did not recognise, and the rocks seemed to roll aside for him. He swam through, and they followed.There was a small pocket of air, trapped in the rocks, and Ecco and Tidesinger rose to breathe once again. Then back down they went, swimming along the dark passages. After a while, they came out into a cavern, although it was more like a room and had obviously been carved out of the rock. There was machinery, lots of it. The humming of electricity could be heard, and the various clings and clangs from inside the machines made Tidesinger uneasy. There was a glass tube on the far wall, about two meters tall, and Ecco led them towards it."What is this place?" asked Kitnee."It is a laboratory that we created, after I defeated the Foe." explained Ecco, "The Foe have seemed to last generations; I will not. I am not immortal. For this reason, The Guardian and I have been creating a new weapon that can fight them. We made it from the same technology as we made The Guardian, so it will be alive and aware. This is Project Doomtrain, which we made in the utmost secrecy, to guard the waters when I pass from this world."Tidesinger had listened intently, and watched as Ecco moved forward and pushed a button with his snout. The tube drained of liquid, and slowly a the form of a dolphin emerged. However, the dolphin was made of an unknown metal, which looked similar to chrome, and it shone brightly, reflecting the lights of the computers. On its head was engraved a skull and crossbones, the symbol of pirates from long ago. It was neither a 'he' nor a 'she', rather an 'it', for it had no true blood running through it, save for a similar liquid to oil, but not so thick and deadly.Slowly the tube slid down, and the robotic dolphin swam out. For a machine, it moved frightfully realistic and smooth, natural even. Kitnee shuddered."Can it speak?" asked Tidesinger."'It' can, although 'it' may choose not to. Please, refer to Doomtrain as a 'she'." answered Ecco.Then Doomtrain spoke. It sounded unlike a machine, but fluent in the songs of the sea."Hello." she said simply. "I am Doomtrain, and I have been created to destroy the Foe here on Earth."None of them answered."What are your names?" asked Doomtrain."I'm Ecco.""Tidesinger.""I'm Kitnee.""Pleased to meet you.""You too." replied Ecco.Tidesinger and Kitnee were literally speechless. They could think of nothing to say.Then, Ecco motioned for them to follow him, and he led the group out of the cavern. The boulders rolled back into place, and they swam towards The Guardian.Well, thought Tidesinger, we'll have to think of a better name than Doomtrain...Chapter ThreeAnd so it was that the four dolphins of assorted shapes and sizes approached The Guardian. Needless to say, some of the dolphins seemed quite curious about Doomtrain. Some of the braver dolphins came up closer, but none actually came within five meters of them. The Guardian was, as ever, almost multi-coloured in appearance, as the sunlight was refracted through its crystalline form.Ecco asked the group to wait for him whilst he spoke to The Guardian, and then left them again. Tidesinger watched him go, and wondered why they weren't allowed to talk as well. He sighed. Ecco was a hero after all. He still felt troubled about where the Foe were coming from, and he tried to shake it off. He looked into the sky, and he realised that it was almost a day since he was attacked by the Foe, and he wondered if he would have to face one of them again. He hoped not.Kitnee swam beside him, as if sensing his disquiet."What's wrong?" she asked softly.Tidesinger flinched, as if he had been hit. Kitnee moved alongside him and nudged him to the surface. He breathed, then seemed to faint.Then he began twitching violently and shaking, as if he was very cold. To Kitnee, he felt as cold as death.Tidesinger woke, but where he was, he did not know. The water around him was dark, and everything seemed unreal and almost dreamlike. A strange mist seemed to cloud his brain, but he couldn't shake it off. He thought back, remembering Kitnee pushing him to the surface. But he thought further back. There was something nagging him, something about the sun. And then he realised; it was the day after the attack- twenty four hours exactly.With this realisation, the world around him seemed to unravel itself. The fog on his mind lifted, and he stared with wonder at what he saw.It was an old city, built many thousands of years ago. Pillars supported the buildings and algae clung to the crags. It was huge... Easily a hundred miles in every direction from where he was floating. Looking up, he saw that there was a rocky cover to the city, as if it had sunk beneath the rocks themselves. Then Tidesinger realised that the pillars looked like those he had passed outside of New Atlantis. He was in Old Atlantis!There was a hiss, as if steam was rising nearby. Following the sound, Tidesinger found a strong current, which seemed to be flowing down from inside the rocks. With closer inspection, Tidesinger saw that it was escaping from a small crack, barely visible. What lay beyond, he did not know.He was suddenly distracted by another hiss. This one was far more frightening, because it had been made by something. Using his sonar, Tidesinger 'saw' an odd crocodilian shape swimming towards him, except that it was mostly black, with streaks of red. That was all he saw, because then he felt an uneasy feeling rise up inside him, and he suddenly twitched violently, and buckled in the water, before gently rising up. Vaguely, he saw the creature approach him, open its jaws wide. But that was the very last he saw of the creature and Old Atlantis.Tidesingers eyes opened slowly, and Kitnee seemed overjoyed to know that he was okay. He was dazed, and she brought him to the surface to breathe. He exhaled, then drew in oxygen. The dizziness passed."Are you alright?" asked Kitnee.Tidesinger shuddered, and Kitnee thought he was going to spasm again. However, he turned to look at her, then said, "I was just in Old Atlantis.""What? You can't have been. You were right here, all the time.""You must have been dreaming," said Doomtrain.It was then that Ecco rejoined the group, and he was told about what had just happened."Old Atlantis? Did it seem real?""Very."Ecco swam around a little in deep thought, "Tell me, Tidesinger. Do you know anything of your heritage?""Not really. My mother was killed by sharks, and my father was last seen here, in Atlantis, nine years ago. But of my deeper ancestry, I know nothing.""Well," said Ecco, "If I may be bold enough to suggest something, will you listen?"Tidesinger drew in his flippers, which in dolphin signalling means yes."Good. Although this may seem far-fetched, The Guardian has told me about a race of dolphins who could seemingly predict future events. A sub-species of Atlantean dolphins, some believe, lesser than the builders, but far more dangerous.""What does that have to do with me?" asked Tidesinger.Ecco paused for a moment, then continued, "The Guardian tells me that these dolphins could be identified by a long, sweeping blue stripe down either flank."Tidesinger didn't move. He stayed motionless in the water for a long time."How..? Are you sure?""Very sure. I have recently seen Trellia, who is a dolphin from the far future. She has told me that things are becoming distorted. Unreal. Her world is falling apart at the seams.""So something is altering the past?" asked Doomtrain."Technically, yes. Although it hasn't started yet in our timeline. Whatever is causing these changes has got to be in our future.""How far away is that? It could be generations before the timelines start getting messed up." noted Kitnee."That's true. Which is why I have taken the liberty of opening the door for you.""The door?""It leads to Old Atlantis. Only Tidesinger may go, and maybe Doomtrain. But Kitnee is too large.""Are you saying I'm fat!?""Kitnee, you're an Orca. You're way bigger than I am." said Tidesinger, grinning, "Besides, I was the only one there in my vision, or whatever it was.""But that doesn't mean that no one else went with you for some of the way." said Doomtrain, "I'm going with you."Ecco agreed, and then said, "Once you get there you will meet many creatures seemingly not of this world. Also, it is possible that some of the Foe are down there. You need to find the time machine built by the Atlanteans and stop Trellia's future from being destroyed. Also, you are certain to meet some of Old Atlantis' guardians. Beware of the legendary Arkonviox, young singer. I have heard of him from the glyphs, but we aren't sure if he or it actually exists.""Why doesn't that make me feel better?" moaned Tidesinger.Ecco swam around, "Kitnee, if you'd stay with me, we have a lot of catching up to do. As for Tidesinger, go back into the underground cavern. Before you branch right, there is a tiny crack with a strong current running through. It can be broken, if you find out how. Beyond that, the door is open."     Tidesinger reluctantly headed for the rift, and Doomtrain followed quickly. As she left, she heard Kitnee cry, "Take care of Tidesinger! Our futures depend on him!" she might have said more, but Doomtrain was out of earshot. Then she swam quickly and followed Tidesinger down into the rift.

heh don't feel and eao some girl i dont know called me out of the blue the other day and wanted to talk to me.Because i didn't know who she was i told her that i didn't have time to talk to her and i was working and that i don't talk to dumb fucks i don't know.And the other day i was talking with a girl i worked with and as well talked she stopped and just started staring at me.I looked at her funny cause she keapt staring then i told her she better stop otherwise she might go blind.The reason i do these things is not to make myself better...but i don't want to break any hearts. I don't have time for a relationship and as much as i regreat doing things i have a burning disie that makes me different from everyone else. That desire is my future and the only way i might end up with anyone is if its someone i like and who is into what im into.You guys dont know this but i caught up with blackfin recently ( who used to run the original Ecco the dolphin website the undercaves that i took over and blah blah ) anyhow all it seems is hes taken his purpose away and is looking for a girl friend to be with because he lets his loneliness get to him.Because i have my computer and my hobbies im always working and relly dont get lonely or sad cause im happy with what im donig and one day it will pave me a great future.Think about it? do you relly have to be with someone to be happy? and why go on a big quest for love? would that relly be worth it? would you relly be happy with that? it depends on who you are...i myself don't like it. i dont have the time to waste because i could be doing so many better things.

Hmmm...well I'm not to good at this stuff, but I do beleive there are some mistakes. It just doesn't seem to fit together well. But let me take a look...I think Karera means then. And then Shizukani oto would mean quiet sound. The word Hirakaremasu if broken up makes some words, but none that fit together properly.But hey, I have no idea if that's really correct, so I'm sure I'm not much help. But I tried!

you brought up soemthing very interesting EaoBlackfin did mention to me that Psysonic had tried to get him to co work with him. But blackfin just told him to fuck off too.If that did happen im pretty sure no one would care just as much as they wouldnt care about silverfin being back.Blackfin is old news...no one cares about him. Now hes being stubborn as hell because he doesnt udnerstand what friends are.

I third what vantid said. I know I haven't been around here lately, so I can't comment on what's been going on since the new forum has been up and running...but back at the Yabb forum...I noticed that topics were sure locked in a hurry. If you ask me...that's almost like self distructing this place. Not much conversation goes on anyway, and all the recent topic locking does is prevent more conversation from taking place. I say if you don't like how a topic's going...then don't read it. Now, if it's WAAAY too off...and entirely gawd-awfully stupid...then that's a different story. But, if ya ask me...topics shouldn't be so quick to be locked...seems like it's not an issue much anymore...but...uhh...yea. I figured I'd throw my two cents in anyway.

Okay......let's do this! Pls review okay?   The sky was colored in the coat of black. Seagulls and albatrosses were soaring over the deep blue sea. One of them, a particularly gruff-looking albatross landed, rather clumsily, on a rock. He looked old with black markings on his wings. He also had a single star-like mark on his forehead."You know, you don't have to rub it in that we can't turn invisible", the old albatross called.As soon as he said this, there was a distortion of light and a creature reappeared. It was a black hawk, missing a right eye. Its remaining eye glinted and was tainted with specks of amber. On its forehead were two star-like markings."Good to see you too, Hez. You look younger everday!" ,the hawk said in a female voice."Hrmpf!!" exclaimed Hez."What?" said the hawk in a too-innocent-to-be-innocent tone."Never mind" replied Hez. "So, have you gathered the others?""Yes. Barak and Azor cooperated although it Achille a bit of convincing." came the reply."He always was obstinate.""Yes....." said the hawk, her voice trailing off."You're not concerened about the writings again are you?" asked Hez, sounding concerned."It bothers me. The writings said that there will be seven chosen ones." replied the hawk."Do not worry. We will find him. Its our only chance to defeat 'it'" said Hez,in a comforting tone."You'd better go and get the last one. We don't have much time." said Hez."Okay. See you then." replied the hawk as it took of into the night sky.  Hez stood on the rock for a moment, lost in his thoughts."We will find you, 'Starbrow'", he whispered.~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~Well? Any comments? Should I continue it?

Well Doomtrain...with the new features the PS2 version is going to offer, it's supposedly going to be easier to know what you're supposed to be doing at any given time. Read up on the stats for the game, at any well known gaming site, and you'll see that that's one of the new things they're talking about. So, if ya ask me, it should be easier to play this new one that's coming out for the PS2, versus the DC version. I'm gettin it...for sure!!! But, ya gotta do what ya gotta do...

Dolphingirl, if you forget what's on the page (as I often do) then I've found if I click on 'back' it'll take me back so I can read it. Then I click 'forward' and the text that I've wrote so far is still there! Cool, huh?

Well, I was sitting here most of last night, drinking coffee and thinking about all the fic writers there are here, and so I had this idea:How many of you would use or find useful a web application, that you could basically just paste/upload formatted text chapters into, and get a heirarchical formatted index, as well as having it processed though a basic "book" style format that this site uses elsewhere.The pros of this system as far as I can see are that it makes it much more trivial for the author to manage their work, as well as streamlining the release of such works.The downside is that formatting options are sorta limited to the global template, so this system would be beyond the scope of being able to create hyperlinked stories or ones that are simlarly illustrated.Give me some feedback, and I'll look into the development aspects of it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That actually sounds quite useful, as my fic is neither illustrated or hyperlinked....
</div>

Er, scroll down the page a little bit, and you'll find a big box maked "Topic Review" that also handly will scroll though all the posts currently in the topic, in cronological order, up to the current page or so.  ;)

Hahaha you mean trace kyshad was a guy?  I thought for sure the way he talked back in the undercaves days.... "Histronic just because you arent compatible with the sonic community doesn't mean that you should just pout about it on another website.  We are a very successful community so whining about it won't help you  whatever you are such a loser."Holy shit that guy was such a fag.  And then there was his female counterpart debaser...."Well arkon you obviously don't know the true meaning of internet forums.  All you do is sit here and be mean to people and (boring shit right here) while i am a member of three other forums which are very tightly knit and filled with lovingkindness...."I sure hope she was trying to sound like a loser because i find it hard to believe someone would really think that was an acceptable thing to say.  The worst thing blackfin ever did was not make a dumbass posts log.

<div id='container'>
eh, not that I remember. Maybe in the very beginning, but that was a long time ago.Yes its good to be back with a spiffy computer and next year I'm going to have a room to myself! Thank GOD!!ah well, more studying becons.Bye for now :-D

Hey, I LIKE Rhythm of the Pridelands! In fact, I'd like it if Doomtrain would burn it for me *pointed look* ;) I used to have the tape but... it melted in the sun. Oi. But I have the first soundtrack and the one for the second movie...

<div id='container'>
To be honest, I prefer to read a *bit* more than that before I comment on a story. But the idea sounds good... yeah, I think you should continue it...

It gets god damn annoying when there's only like two topics to post in. Which is why I don't bother half the time, especially if the topics that are left open are ones I don't care about.

Interesting conversation is right 0_o;Blackfin lost his website and is all of a sudden lonely? He was always lonely...

<div id='container'>
Well I brought it up with a japanese speaking friend, but she couldn't get much out of it. Let's see, Hiraku I think means to open or hold out. "Are" simply means "that", and masu could mean trout or increase.   But I'm not positive or anything.

Well, I drew this picture a while ago and I'm having troubles with how I should finish it off. I figured the people in here are always full of some neat idea's, so maybe you could help. Take a look//beisick.dolphinparadise.net/ideas.jpgThe big white space that the guy is looking into is supposed to be a mirror, but the thing is, I don't want him to be seeing just a reflection. I want somthing weird. I like weird. I had lots of idea's, but none that really stuck. I though a skeleton, a demon, himself with someone behind him, or maybe just a fucked-up himself too.So dose anyone have any weird idea's? Just put em' down and maybe I can combin idea's and such.This would also be my first "joint-effort" picture, I guess you could call it. ^_^ So what do you think?Oh...and sorry for the crapy scan. It'll be fixed up later.

Ah *sweet*!!! I'm "Project Doomtrain"! That's way cool Tidey! I want to hear more, because it's sounding great so far! Heh heh, I'm a robot, cool.

Could someone make me a better face pic? Please??I could make one but I'd want to use a different picture which means I'd have to draw another one seeing as I have only the one picture of Tethys' latest form.  But I don't feel like drawing another one.

Relly doomtrain i wouldn't worry about what games you should buy for the ps2 yet considering you don't have one and i don't picture you having one anytime soon unless you win the lottery because i don't think your parents will buy you one...plus if you do ever get a ps2 you could always rent the game and see if you like it before you go ahead and buy it. maybe one time my family will disappear for a couple of days and we can do our PLAN  again and play ps2 all the time. but don't get your hopes up...it isn't ever likely to happen...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes.  It's easy to write in script format.  But how about imagery?  You know, like in a REAL story.  Now THAT'S a challange.  And a lot more fun, too.  (I'm not claiming to be a great writer, I just think that I could be if only I could come up with some decent ideas. And if I knew how to write dialouge that doesn't sound really stupid all the time).To me I just think that the Blundercaves and All in the Family are just weird--they always leave me thinking "ooooookkkkkaaaayyyy..." in the end. But I'm not saying they're bad.  I'm just saying they're weird.  Yet entertaining in any case, and I do enjoy reading them.  But so far I like the Blundercaves better for the most part.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Damn you all! &gt;P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ha ha! I like the Final Fantasy one (of course I would). That one is pretty funny. I can't wait until I come in. It'll be great. Heh heh.

What in the hell is this topic about again? Oh right, retardation. Yep, I agree with Histronic... it makes sense...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
And i bet some people cant put their money where their mouth is.Ya know, we ARE accepting stories. You can write them any way you want and send them to me and i'll put together the episode in its normal All in the family format.Alls you have to do is remember to use the main charicters and charicters that are already in the story, and if you want, add charicters. =PIll even make the face pics for them, just make sure is funny.Also, i personally have been liking the blundercaves as of late. The difference between All in the family and the Blundercaves is i make all in the family episodes and Arkon makes The Blundercaves episodes.And once in awhile, i do blundercaves episodes too.You get the 2 for more choices. My brand of writting and Arkons. And im not saying mines better or anything but All int he family is their incase you like a difference in our brand of product. Heh.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay.  All Ihad to do was change the filename so that it said 11 instead of 10. I'm so stupid.Well part 2 seems to be based off of something but I have no clue what.  And part 3 just didn't make a lot of sense.  I was confused at times. But then, it's not hard to confuse me.

the point in locking a topic is becausemost of the time they go off topic. If your gonna go off topic make a new topic.Thats what i was trying to enforce. Plus i was tired of seeing very boring topics come back up. It doesnt effect this place to do any general locking especialy since theres too many dull topics, alot made by me i admit =) and i have taken care of.Right now i asked the lackeys to take it easy and let things be but id rather see people talking aboutnew things in new topics rather then changing a topic into something else.Lucky us mods have a function that splits topics that we may exparament with soon. But im listening to what you mean. Just the way i see it theres alot of topics not worth further discussion. Not to worry though im working on new stratgeys since were getting alot of complaints!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
so many people are dependant on love it kind of makes me sick. You know what the scariest thing is? To not know your place in this world. To me it seems theres alot of people who don't know there place. I know my place, to move forward and not let anything hold me back.

These kids nowadays! these bloody contraptions... boxes with screens... they could hurt somebody with thiers pointy edges! Well in my day, we used to entertain ourselves all day with a stick! Nothing unsafe about a stick, unless you hit someone with it. But all by yourself, you'd be safe. Unless you hit yourself, but that didn't happen hardly ever. And man was in fun! You could carry it around, drag it on the ground, stick it in the ground like a flag pole... oh man. You see, kids nowadays don't know how to have fun anymore, and their just going to hurt themselves with these fancy dancey high tech gadgetry doo-dads like screens...just say no to computer screens..

Yeah...after a month of doin' nothing with my site, I've gotten around to updating. Just added two new paintings...nothing major. I just figured I'd let you all know, just in case anyone out there cares. *shrugs and goes back to working on her major furry project*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow, Tidey!  That was incredible! I can't wait to find out what happens next.Okay, now, as for Tethys, I'm not sure if she could fit into the story at all, but maybe you can figure something out.  If not, you don't have to write her in, I don't mind.Here's my picture//www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/DisplayBioImg.pl?PNO=1606&amp;ANO=1610&amp;BType=CAnd I'll just copy and paste what I wrote in her bio on Side 7.  age purple/lavender/white (amethyst), w/ sapphire blue eyesTethys is one of the four Gaurdians of the Oceans. There is one Gaurdian for each of the four oceans. Tethys is of the Atlantic Ocean. The four Gaurdians appeared when the continents drifted apart, splitting the single ocean Panthalassa into the four seperate oceans. According to legend, they split off from a single being that exsisted as an elemental and Gaurdian of the One Ocean. Not much is known about these Gaurdians, and no one has ever seen any of them. As the world evolved, their existance was forgotten and replaced by legend. Now, even the legends have been forgotten by many.That's all I've worked out so far.  I haven't really thought about it much. I don't know anything about the other three gaurdians still, but I do know that the Inidan Ocean Gaurdian is female and the other two are male.  And I don't know anything about the one original Gaurdian.  BTW, I didn't make up Panthalassa. I'm not even sure I spelled it right, it might have two l's, I can't remember.  When all of the continents were together as a single continent, Pangaea (I might have spelled that wrong, also), there was also just one big ocean called Panthalassa. (Pangaea means "all lands"or something like that and Panthalassa means "all oceans").  So, knowing that, I decided it would make sense that at the time there was only one Gaurdian since there was only one ocean.When I said the legends had now been forgotten by many, "now", of course, refers to this very present, this very instant, this year.  So by the time of your story there probably is nobody left who knows anything at all about even a fragment of those legends. So, basically, nobody has any idea that Tethys and the other gaurdians exist at all. After all, the sea is incredibly vast, and the gaurdians have a way of hiding themselves.Oh, yes. Tethys is incredibly kind and benovelent and gentle and all of that.  She cares for all creatures and will do no harm, except as a very last resort (it would be the last thing she'd do in a thousand millenia).  She is also very wise, since she has been around for as long as the four oceans have existed.Oh, and a little bit that I just came up with.  The Gaurdians work in the background.  They help through indirect actions.  In fact, they would probably be helping out Ecco and the others in discreet ways.  They know all that goes on in their particular ocean.  That means that Tethys knows all that goes on in the Atlantic, but in order to know what is happening in the other oceans she must contact the other gaurdians.  If things are bad enough, and whatever they are doing isn't helping, they may take direct action.  Their power is very extensive, but they will never use it in full, and, in fact, will always use as little of their power as possible.Tethys is the Gaurdian of the Atlantic, but she -can- go anywhere in any ocean if she has a reason.  But, at this point, she has never had any reason to leave the Atlantic Ocean and so she has never been anywhere else.Oh, and some things I forgot to mention about her appearance.  Her body is shiny, having the same kind of shimmer as a polished gemstone, and her eyes resemble sapphires (I didn't know how to acheive a shine effect).  And she's quite large, but not as big as an actual plesiosaur (which is what her appearance is modeled after).  I guess I haven't really decided how big she is...She would be bigger than an orca, but not by a large ammount.  She is, however, very long, especially with that tail.  The tail fins alone (if you can call those fins) are a little longer than her body, and the tail itself is a little more than half that length.  Even her body is long.  But I rally have no idea just how long in relation to anything else.  I'm thinking that, including the tail and tailfins, she'd be somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 times the length of an orca or even a little longer.  Her power allows her to hide easily and to go anywhere at all in the ocean, however, so she doesn't have to worry about her size.Whew.  That's about it (and much more than I thought I was going to write).  I don't mind if you make up some things.

The only languages offered in schools here are Spanish, French, and German (and Spanish is not useless, it's probably the second most spoken language in the U.S.).And you say your an 8 year??!  And you STILL don't know much???  How is that possible?  Here you can't take a foreign language until 8th grade, so obviously that's different wherever you're at.  But I'm in 5th year Spanish and I'm practically fluent.  I'd think you should be fluent in a language after studying it for 8 years.In any case, one of my friends has been trying to learn Japanese on her own, but she just started this year and knows very little.  I know nothing about it.  But I did have the impression "no" can actually mean many things depending on the context.  So does that mean you have to say "desu" at the end of every sentance?I never even saw that glyph.  And I don't even know what a mega cd is...

Well I'm too lazy to do all of that....maybe if I ever have a lot of time on my hands...And, in addition to what Hist said, you coulda redrawn that pic.  But, then again, I know I never like to redraw anything...

There's an Arthur show?  I used to love those books when I was little.  I thought he was an anteater because I had an old book from before he looked the way he does now and he looked like an anteater...but aardvarks look similar, so it's possible.

I thought the orca in ToT was thje same as the one in Ecco 1, and also the same as Tara in Ecco Jr.  The way the dorsal fin is makes it look female.  I don't remember it actually following you like that to where Big Blue is.

You keep talking about your fic. The story line has merit to it. I suggest to you to just sit down one day and write/type out what ideas you have. Just one if you don't feel like doing to much work. Maybe throw in some dialoge and develop a plot. Once you get started, and the ideas take root, they start to flow. Most of the work done on my fic was done within the last month, even though I first started it in January. I had it with me one day and decided to add another idea to it, and it just took off. If you get stuck, try a different angle, or read some of the work already here. Remember, no one sees them until you post them here, so it doesn't matter if you mess up an idea, you can change it at your leisure. If the ideas are in your mind, they can easily go on paper. I only wish I could draw that way. :?

Hahaha you mean trace kyshad was a guy?  I thought for sure the way he talked back in the undercaves days.... "Histronic just because you arent compatible with the sonic community doesn't mean that you should just pout about it on another website.  We are a very successful community so whining about it won't help you  whatever you are such a loser."Holy shit that guy was such a fag.  And then there was his female counterpart debaser...."Well arkon you obviously don't know the true meaning of internet forums.  All you do is sit here and be mean to people and (boring shit right here) while i am a member of three other forums which are very tightly knit and filled with lovingkindness...."I sure hope she was trying to sound like a loser because i find it hard to believe someone would really think that was an acceptable thing to say.  The worst thing blackfin ever did was not make a dumbass posts log.===============================================I'm a member of two other message boards (alongside this one), and I also have a "Chatroom Female Counterpart" on one of those.

Now I found something interesting. In the starting point of Ecco II's City of Forever level there is a glyph behind Ecco. I have no idea what it does in the Mega CD/PC versions.. but when you sing to it in the English Genesis game - it is a blank screen. I went into the Jap game and sang to it.. Now I have a message that I need to translate.(Please note I may have misjuged some spaces by pure accident)Topiraha(may be a 'wa') Kareraniyotte HirakaremasuKarera o('wo') Okoraseteha(again may be a 'wa') IkemasenShizukani oto o('wo') Tsuiteiu no desu.If anyone has knowledge of Japanese - please do chip in an help translate this. It may end up being a useless message - but I really want to work out what it says - because that may clue together the puzzle of it not being in the english version. ~Whitefin===============================================Did someone mention awhile ago that, there is a LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR on one of these websites (like Lycos or Google)?I could help (probably)I think it was you Whitey.

I tryed to draw a G rated ecco, he had on boxer shorts.combine a whale, kouwala, cat, lawyer, bird togher and see what ya get!

8O OMG... I remember that site. I must have stopped by the last day it was up. I remember getting excited by such a recent update, I don't usually find live websites.   I thought something looked a little different the next time I clicked the link.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
so it's the same whale? could it be the Orca from Ecco Jr also?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Perfect! I was insinuating things about him in the first chapter of my fanfic, hinting that you would see him, and now it is confirmed!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, YES!   Heh heh. Nah, I don't think I ever played it, but I did play 'Revenge of the Shinobi', which was pretty damn annoying...

Romance Novels again? They're just gay. While it's POSSIBLE (and I'm willing to admit) that SOME of them (and I mean a very small few) actually have a plot to them that's somewhat interesting... they all basically have these things in common, which I figured out listening to Jader ramble on about the bloody thingsroll:

<div id='container'>
**Sheds a tear for old times** ahh, yes, those were the days...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, do what Eao said. (laughs) And I wanna see it when it's done.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol was the one always asking about it.welp, seeing as how Ecco PC is an seemlingly older game it may burn well.as for finding it....I try and try, the sonic games and some "sega power pack" sell, but no ecco.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have beat ecco, I just cant get a sega cd. And I would really like to see the video from TOT that shows what happened in the first game, mostly to see what the vortex queen looks like in 3d. If anyone would like to help out, you could simply play your version up to that point, print the screen into clipboard, turn it into a bitmap, and put it up here? Anything to help a brotha out!

i'm from NJ, thats like....another planet.naw, we aren't that bad, I'm just allergic to where I live.

me and spiffy shark have been cool for a long time. The only problem we had went way back during the time when the udnercaves was dying and i was telling everyone who posted there to stop.We had a scwabble but its over, that was many many many months ago in a time forgotten.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wahahahh! A new Shinobi game! In FULL 3D! Now we can play the most annoying platformer ever invented in the history of mankind, in 3D! If you have a Ps2. Which I don't. Well, looks like I got somethin else to put on my christmas list!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, good news and bad news... kinda.  Hit a writer's block on the last part of Song of the Rising, which is only bad for me, and anyone held in suspense over part 2. It's not that I don't have any ideas, I just can't peice them together.  That leaves me open to develop ideas for this here project while I let SoR ferment in my mind. Of course, this could be bad news for Phosis, seeing as how I'll have to keep updating him on what I write. :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey thats cool. I have the beginning and the end of my part of the prject, (Go figure) thought out, but I also need to know how it will tie in with your story, so in other words, where to begin!

<div id='container'>
I thought everyone would take the dolphin but i guess popular movies win again!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Anyways, now that I have your attention, I know this is a longshot, but....Would anyone who owns Ecco PC either sell it to me, or burn it and sell that copy? or does anyone know where to get a rip of it? I really wanna see the TOT intro movie. Even directing me to a site that will let me watch that movie would be fine! I am desperate!*Also not a guarantee

I'll be adding to it sometime later Tidesinger, I'm absolutely swamped with projects right now. One being a HUGE furry-baised one. Don't worry though, I will be continuing to add to it.

I dont know about you guys, but ya gotta love it. Im talking about the old skool ecco 1/2 music. I just love to listen to the gym's arkon has *patpats arkon for having them* anyways, im just gonna ask you a few questions that anyone can answer cuz im curious..1. wats ur fave song from ecco 1?2. wats ur fave song from ecco 2?3. do you have any memories attatched to any song from ecco 1/2?ill answer just for fun1. I love City of Atlantis, the tube, and big blue's theme..there are a bunch others too2. mmm...skylands, trellia's bay, epilogue, fault zone, fin to feather, home bay....3. oh man, i had an insane obsession with playing ecco TOT in grade 5, so whenever i hear any ecco TOT (big water is the worst on my, i loved that level so much) I get all nostalgic remebering playing ecco down in my basment in vancouver.  i remeber doing crazy things like putting paper up to the TV, pausing the games, and tracing trellia (^^;;; ) and running away from "fault zone" (if anyone remebers that story from when i 1st came to arkonviox.com :D)anyways, i have alotta memories of those games, wat about you guys?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I always liked the title tune from TOT (I always listened to it on this site-TOT track 40)I've forgot the music from Ecco 1, it's been that long since i played it... but i can't b bothered to go to the index and check them out...But now I found a download from DOF (called descent of the Foe) and i listne to that all day... :)

Hey guys, these are some wicked idea's! Keep em' coming! Now I'll have to decide what to do.And Swifty, that idea is similar to one I had. I was thinking it could be him in a business suite with all of these buildings around him. So maybe since you had a similar opinion, I should do somthing like that.Well, I want to hear more either way! What do you think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tethys, yuo got it right. We don't all go to the same school, but all the schools here in Calgary were on strike, so we've been off for three week (not encluding a week for finals).And Swifty, that would be an interesting picture.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Arkon, what part of what I said were you commenting on?  It was just that I hadn't noticed at first that when I clicked the link for episode 11 the URL actually said episode 10.  If I had seen that, I would have known to change it.Oh, and what Eao said reminded me of something I was confused about, which I forgot about after I read part 3.  I didn't understand why Bantid didn't want anyone to say the word "summoner".
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
LOL!Well, actually, I AM stupid.  But I didn't say I don't understand your stories (except for the last one), I just said that I think they're weird.  In the same way that I think South Park is weird, but funny anyway.

Well i mostly liked blundercaves better before it had a real plot.... just arkon sitting around yelling at people and telling them to shut the fuck up.  My favorite blundercaves episodes were the forum parodies with jewish priest arkon haha those were the days.  To tell you the truth i think they lost a lot of humor after blackfin left and arkon wasn't oppressed anymore.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow....it's an origional idea, I'll give ya that!! I don't see why it wouldn't be a possiblity sometime in the future.  Cool idea Van'.  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You fucking fag friecceo O_oThe gryphon guild is probably a lot like sonic hq.... like how sonic hq deletes every minor swear and then turns around and still acts like an asshole to you.  At least arkon is a cool asshole i mean he's funny.  But they.... well it makes me want to do that thing in jay and silent bob strike back when they buy plane tickets to all these places and kick the shit out of everyone who made fun of them on the internet.

well im glad this topic has collapsed into chaos!  I expected that to happen.  I dont know if anyone read the italicized text i used to write in alastors edited post but it sure as hell doesnt seem like it!  Maybe you thought it was a sig i mean so many people have these weirdass itacized poetry couplets in their sigs these days its quite understandable.  But trust me if alastor can't find anything good to say about nintendo to put in his sig he wont have a sig at all!  And for now on read my notes dammit.

<div id='container'>
Heh, one of my friends was able to snag a copy of jay and silent bob strike back on dvd a few days before it came out, and i jut had to tell you its the most perfect dvd ever made!  When it comes out everyone should get it.... the movie is funny as hell and it comes loaded with all the deleted scenes they cut to avoid a NC-17 rating.  *gets his advertisement check from kevin smith*  Just remember don't watch it when your parents are home.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i love it when arkon changes my posts he always makes me say soemthing more interesting. since what i normally say is always sarcastic and boring.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Dude tethys did you even see that movie?  Its all about the ill tempered seabass!and i believe "kick his ass seabass" is from dumb and dumber, but its been a long time since ive seen it.

Hey you know what, I think that is an awesome idea! But you know... I've never known anyone that's that close in a forum to give someone there address. Well, sept Trell and Whitefin, they seem very close. But I still think it is a great idea!Perhaps someone has a blank book hang'n around. You could send an empty book around and have everyone draw in one page or somthing. ??? I dunno.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah! thats an awsome idea! ^_^ maybe, each person could get a page and then they could draw thier char along with some writing or something! ^_^ hehe, postal may be alot tho, we should figure out the best way in which to go in wat order for ppl to pay the least ammount of moneyexample: whitefin wont want to pay shipping all the way to eastern canada to tina o.o;anyways, awsome idea!!

Well I couldn't really answer # 1 and 2, because I don't know what music goes whith what levels, and what the levels are called at that. But I ca say for # 3 that all that neet creepy music in some levels has given me some inspiration. I always liked the scary stuff. But there was one level that had really cool music. Can't remember what it was though.

Boy, that's a lot of help, Doomtrain ;DThese songs are from the Genesis version of the Ecco games because um... well, I didn't have a Sega CD...Ecco 13) Island Zone2) Jurassic Beach/all the prehistoric levels1) The VentsEcco 23) Aqua Tubeway/The Epilogue (the screwy version of Moray Abyss)... a tie between the two2) Crystal Springs1) Trellia's BayI do remember that a long time ago, I would always rent Ecco one, and Doomtrain and I would be out in my little kiddy pool, and we'd always wind up inside playing Ecco after we got out of the pool. The level I was always on was the Vents, so I guess you could say the song from that level kinda reminds me of that time.And just for the helluvit... my favorite songs from the CD versions of Ecco are St. Gabriel's Mask and Abyss.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Y'don't really need a boyfriend/girlfriend to know that someone thinks  highly of you, Eao. If you have a best friend, or even a couple good friends, then you know someone really likes to spend their time with you, otherwise they wouldn't be your friends. Think of that instead!I know I'd be going absolutely nuts without any of my friends, Doomtrain and Jader particularly... I mean, who else would listen to my crazy rambling about shit that no one else but the three of us care about?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I wuv the Gaberial's Mask's vocal version and Trace K's remixes and ecco music in general.A long time ago I posted somthing on Blackfin's board about "fan music" lyrics writen for ecco music (some things may need remixing)although totaly illegal, unless we can be friends with Sega, but I doubt that, or write to spencer Neilson and ask him to make more vocal music with that Guy who sings.but I think it's cute idea.

Eao...it's a JOKE.  Nothing on that site is serious.  It was obviously made to make fun of porn sites.  It's especially obvious if you read the warning page.  The whole thing is a parody.  And I don't see anything wrong with that.  It's -meant- to be stupid.  So in my opinion I don't think there's any reason for it to go on the hall of shame, since it is meant to be a joke, except maybe for the fact that it's really not very funny.

I don't care.  I never participated in it, and I probably never will.  Partly because I've never participated in one, in fact I've never seen one nor did I know there was such a thing until recently (after all, this is really the only forum I've ever posted more than just a few times in), and so I'm not really certain what it is exactly (besides fighting and shit) and I have no clue what to do or how to do it.  And partly because I'm not really all that interested anyway.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What fic? I had no idea you were working on one.So those are all paintings?  What kind of paint?  Well, it doesn't matter anyway.  I may be able to draw decently but I can't paint worth shit.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I didn't even know those games were ON Sega CD.  It doesn't matter anyway because I never had one.  And besides I'd think the soundtrack would be the same.  And the Genesis games were the original versians anyway.The only two songs I remember from Ecco 1 happen to be my two favorites.  I loved the title theme.  And I really loved the music from the time-travel sequence, even tho it was short, but I found it relaxing and almost hypnotising.At the moment I can't remember any music from Ecco 2.  I can't even think of how the title song sounded.  Um...I don't really have any specific memories attached to any song...Except that in the very beginning of Ecco one in the part before the storm comes, when it plays the music from the title, I would just swim and jump around for a long time because I thought it was fun.

I tried to translate something in Japanese with AltaVista, but ti won't work unless you have the symbols.  Besides, when I've used it to translate Japanese web sites, it always has trouble with a lot of words and they just come up with boxes.  Some sites are worse than others.  And, of course, it translates things literally, so it doesn't always make sense.  Okay, so that doesn't help...I just wanted to say it..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmm...now I suddenly remembered a song which is now stuck in my head...and it's one that I like but I don't think it's a favorite..I can't remember what it's from, tho, but I think it might be Island Zone or whatever that level was called.You know Ecco Jr. had a nice soundtrack, too.  There's one I particularly liked quite a bit.  But as I never actually owned it, I have no idea where it's from in the game.And, I shoulda said this before...Y'know, Hist, a lot of people like game music.  They may not listen to it all the time, but many games have goodsoundtracks, and if people didn't like it, then nobody would download music files of them.

I can pay shipping, regardless of how much. I don't think it would cost more than 12 bucks...a MOST.If we ever do this, it's gonna be more than ONE sketchbook floating around, I'd be willing to send one around to! ^_^

^_^ And then we can all scan the pages we did XD and have them in an online book D Its only about 9 bucks Australian to get a sketchbook up to Canada areas XD~ *twindles off as nazi's are asking them to set up things for the information night*

<div id='container'>
i am also in favor of this idea! it seems quite clever, sending a sketchbook to the artists of this forum... perhaps we can try to plot out who will send it to whom, from the closest to the next closest and so on. i would definitely like to try this out, though, and would be willing to pay for the shipping to send the book on its way. however, if we are to participate in this, someone else would have to scan my drawing... lack of such equipment and all   ...    so these would just be sketches? i would believe that mine would have to be, seeing as i am one of those artists that can take *ages* to complete a full, good drawing... but i think i'm up to giving this a go  :D

Tethys: jay and silent bob were two characters from the movie 'Dogma', in which they played a minor, yet still large and crude enough to be noticed, role... in fact, i think it was silent bob who wrote that movie... anyway, i was suprised to see that they had decided to come out with a movie all of their own, though... i will have to look into it, as it does appear somewhat amusing... but thank you for the heads up on the release of it, Hist!

heh sure eao when ever the fuck i go to huston park or hudsington forest or hamilton beach.

Well amn i mean video game music is good when you play the game but people who listen to it when they aren't playing games typically have names like Psysonic and add video game music to posts to express sadness to the fact that they're boyfriend left and so on.  man just looking at this post makes me want to issue out random bans,  -_-

I'm in. Just let me know when to expect da book and I'll be happy.  No rush. I can be the last person to get it as far as I'm concerned. I'm gonna send one of my own around to....once I buy a new one. XD

<div id='container'>
Well the only Final Fantasy game I've played was FFIV, but there wasn't anything like monster summoners or callers or whatever.  At least not that I'm aware of. But then again, since I only rented it once, I didn't get very far, so I really don't know.  It may have been called "The Final Fantasy" but I figured that didn't necesarily mean it was based off those games, especially since it sounded to me almost like a combination of Pokemon and Monster Rancher.

What are you talking about?  I wasn't complaining or anything.  I was simply saying it doesn't matter to me either way, I was being apathetic.  I guess I didn't have to say anything about it at all, but I did anyway.  It's no big deal.

<div id='container'>
Of course.  I will if I ever get around to it.

<div id='container'>
I don't think this will be possible for me.  I have no money and no income, and I don't want to make my parents pay for it.  I don't want to buy a new sketchbook and I don't want anyone to see all the crap I've got in the one I'm working in now.  And my parents would want to know what I am sending and why, and I just don't think I could explain it to them. And they probably wouldn't like it if I kept sending out all of these sketchbooks.  Besides, I'm really hesitant to give out my address.

<div id='container'>
of course i'm in, Whitefin!  :D  i definitely wish to be in this one! though, i certainly wouldn't mind being one of the last few people to receive this floating sketchbook, mainly so that i can catch a glimpse of what everyone else has completed. as soon as we get a list of who is going to participate, then mapping out who will receive the book when will be the next priority. making a nice little circle to loop the book to all of the artists will create a nice little 'boomerang' affect so that the sketchbook will eventually get back to its owner with little trouble at all.  i do hope that we can accumulate enough people for this plan to make it quite interesting! an arkonviox.com community sketchbook, a truly excellent idea! our little project 'sketchbook in a bottle', is coming along quite well now ^_^

Chapter OneIt was a beautiful day in the waters of Suffolk, near the UK. The sky was blue, the ocean calm. It wasn't apparent of the imminent danger facing the world.It is the thirtieth century, and five hundred years before, dolphin and man had started working together, and had lived in peace and harmony, creating an almost perfect world, known as the Golden Age. Dolphins were incredibly intelligent, and had long concealed their sentience from man. Then, five hundred years ago, they revealed themselves...They had both worked together, and eventually extended their reach beyond our solar system and offered peace and friendship to all who would welcome it.However, there was a species to whom aggression was the highest calling....Creatures known only as the Foe watched the Earth with an envious eye, for Earth was a prize without equal. Ages ago, the Foe came close to conquering all, but dolphin and man brought their age of conquest to an end. Reduced to near-destruction, the Foe probed Earth for a moment of weakness...But the few caretaker dolphins who stayed behind were not defenceless. The Guardian, their greatest creation, shielded them with its immense power. It would draw on the Earths power to place a force field around the planet, rendering Earth indestructible.It was in this time of crisis that a dolphin called Ecco lived. He had defeated the Foe, when they once managed to destroy the Guardian and alter Earths past, stopping the monumentous event that brought humans and dolphins together. Ecco had travelled to Atlantis, and was pulled through the time rift when the Foe invaded. He battled through alternate time lines, trying to put things back right. He visited Mans nightmare, where Man and the Foe had destroyed each other, and only a few dolphins survived. He travelled through Dolphins nightmare, a time where dolphins ruled the world aggressively, and had wiped out mankind.Finally he travelled to a Earth ruled by the Foe, and there he defeated the Foe queen, and saved his reality.This story is set in Ecco's world, but it is not about the young singer of destiny. This is of another dolphin, and his quest to defeat the next Foe invasion. On his travels he will meet and lose friends, and make enemies of many species, including the Foe. He was Tidesinger, a dolphin bestowed with an unusual power. He didn't know what it was, or how to use it. He just felt it. He knew he had it.And so, it was left to this dolphin, Tidesinger, to protect the Earth and its billions of inhabitants, from the Foe.Tidesinger swam through the clear waters that surrounded the Old United Kingdom. Of course, it was no longer known as that. It had since been renamed, when dolphin and man began to co-exist. This old country was where the Asterite lived, at least, that was what the rumours said. But no one had ever seen it, save for the great Ecco, although it was believed to exist anyway. Tidesinger was a young dolphin, fifteen years. He jumped and dived, always in a playful mood. He had a blue stripe down both flanks, starting just above a flipper, and ending between his dorsal fin and his flukes.He was a lone swimmer. It wasn't often that he socialised, he only ever had once before. But he had always dreamed of joining a pod, but he had never found one that he really liked, or that he felt attached to. His body was scarred from fights with sharks, although he preferred not to fight them. Only when he needed to would he do so.Tidesinger swam on, heading nowhere in particular, just enjoying himself as he darted through the fish and explored the ocean floor. It was a while before he noticed, but he realised the ocean around him was deadly silent. It was creepy, because he could normally hear the smallest of things, but the ocean was silent. He swam to the ocean floor, noticing with some unease that not a creature stirred. In fact, using his echo-location, he soon realised that he was the only creature for maybe miles around.Then he heard something. A shriek, very high pitched, although it sounded quiet, as if from some distance away. Tidesinger didn't know the creature; he could tell from its song. It sang of death and destruction, and great hunger.He got a very bad feeling.He rose to the surface to breath, and he then dived back under, and the wailing shriek was much closer. He saw the creature through his eyes; it was so close that he didn't need to pick it up on sonar.It was black, and resembled an insect in the way that armour plates locked into place around its body. Its head was shaped narrowly, and widened towards the top. It had many tentacles, that snaked around its body as it swam. It glided silently through the water like a wraith, with only the foul shriek revealing its presence.Tidesinger turned tail and powered away as fast as he could. The creature suddenly screamed; it had spotted him. It began to give chase, and it began catching up with the young dolphin.Tidesinger powered his muscles for extra speed, rising to the surface to breathe every so often. He could sense the creature close by, and it scared him.What was it?He was tiring, and the creature was still chasing him. It didn't seem to tire, like the robots man had built centuries ago...He turned, facing the creature. It slowed down, and began moving towards him silently. Tidesinger shivered. It was hunting him.The creature was almost upon him, and Tidesinger prepared to charge it. As he did, the tentacles snaked around his body, trapping him in its clutches. It began to draw him closer, and then he felt a searing pain in his side as something cut into his muscles, spilling warm red blood into the cold waters.He tried pulling away, but the creature had him. He could not move, and he was going to die...He began to get a relaxed feeling, withdrawn from his own body. He felt like he was in a dream, as if it was happening to someone else. He barely noticed the Orca power towards them. It grasped the creature in its teeth and shook it violently. Black blood filled the water, but that was the last that Tidesinger saw. His world seemed to blur, before it finally went black...  Chapter TwoHe opened his eyes, slowly, but recoiled as bright sunlight shone into his eyes. When his eyes finally adjusted, he opened them, and to his surprise, right there before him, was his rescuer. He surfaced to breathe, and began thinking of questions to ask the Orca."Ugh..." he said softly, "who are you? What happened?""My name is Kitnee." she replied, "Are you okay? You were attacked by that creature.""Creature...?" he tried to remember what had happened. It was unclear, but he remembered being cut deep along his flank. He craned his neck to look at the wound. It had healed, but had scarred. A long white line ran along his body.Kitnee swam towards him, a little closer. She stopped just before him."So, then. Do you know what it was that attacked you?""No, I don't. Do you?""No. It was your scream that drew me near. You're very fortunate to be here..."Tidesinger paused for a moment, looking at Kitnee."My name is Tidesinger.""Yes, I know that. I have heard of you many times on my travels. You are a great shark-slayer, are you not?""I don't know about great.. But I can hold my own.""You're too modest. You should be proud to be able to fight those things.""But I couldn't fight that creature...""No, you couldn't. But I think I know what it was. If I asked, could you describe it to me?""Yes, I could. Why?""Then we shall request an audience with the great Ecco.""Ecco? Why?""I'm not entirely sure, but I believe that you just faced one of the Foe..."Kitnee began swimming in the direction of Atlantis, and Tidesinger raced after her.Tidesinger had never been to Atlantis before, and he was nervous. Furthermore, he was going to meet the greatest hero the world had known for generations. He also was looking forward to it. Atlantis was said to be a beautiful place, almost totally submerged. Dolphin and man had built it together, on the supposed ruins of old Atlantis, which was swallowed by the sea thousands of years ago...Every now and then he would surface to breathe, but strangely the Orca, Kitnee, never rose for one breath. He decided not to ask about it, so he thought of another question."Have you met Ecco before?""The Orca swam on, and sang back, "I know him very well. We could be called best friends, but we haven't seen each other for a long time."How long?""I'd say about ten years. I have been busy travelling, seeing the world. That is what brought me along this route. I was going to go to the Arctic, to visit family. But this is much more important.""If that was the Foe, how did it manage to get past the Guardian?""I do not know. But I think we will understand more once we have spoken to Ecco.""Is it much further?" asked Tidesinger."No. About half an hour."Tidesinger jumped clear of the water, exhaling, and took in a lung full of oxygen. He splashed back down beside Kitnee. He could already see the ancient pillars and ruins of Old Atlantis. They were white marble, and bore markings of man and dolphin swimming together. Moss and algae covered most of it, and fish darted in and out of the pillars. It looked and seemed very creepy.Not long after, they swam towards a large island. It had a mountain rising at its centre, and a few buildings were visible above small ridges. Together, the two dolphins swam around the outskirts of the island, before reaching a small bay. Tidesingers echolocation told him that there were two humpbacks, a mother and calf. There was also four dolphins swimming around, playing with each other and splashing on the surface.Kitnee lead him to a stone gate. Engraved above it was a crescent moon, which began to glow as they both approached. It was only then that Tidesinger noticed the crescent moon on Kitnee's head. It too was glowing with a strong golden light. Slowly, with a great scraping sound, the stone doors opened, letting out shafts of light from inside, dazzling him. Temporarily blinded, he used his sonar to follow Kitnee inside. When his eyes adjusted, he could see murals along the walls. They showed a dolphin with stars on its head. Ecco. They showed various stages of his journey throughout time to rescue the globes, each of which represented various traits. Compassion, wisdom, intelligence, humility and ambition. Without these traits dolphins were not complete, and so became enslaved in the world of Mans nightmare. There, Ecco found the globe of ambition and intelligence, and once returned to dolphins, they conquered the Earth and destroyed mankind. What had happened to the Foe, Ecco could not guess, and from the various information he obtained he discovered that The Clan, lead by the evil Mutaclone, was holding the globe of ambition. The resistance led Ecco to the globe of compassion, and then to the clans headquarters. Once he had traversed the hanging waters, he faced Mutaclone himself. Once he was defeated, Ecco retrieved the globe. With four globes returned to dolphins, Ecco was faced with a reality where the dolphins beheld no wisdom. They were easily conquered by the Foe. Ecco had to defeat the Foe Queen to be able to retrieve the last globe. When he had got it, his world was restored.After Tidesinger finished looking at the murals, Kitnee lead him further into Atlantis. It wasn't the age-old Atlantis that was said to have sunk beneath the ocean. It was a new Atlantis, built to be a place of peace and friendship. Here, the Guardian rested, and he had created a crystal statue of Ecco, that emerged from the Guardian itself. It was said to glow the seven colours of the rainbow when the Foe were close by. Still, no one had ever discovered Old Atlantis, as it became known. The ocean had been explored fully, with not any clues, save for the collapsed pillars before the island, which led many to believe that New Atlantis was actually built on the ruins of Old Atlantis, although it had never been proven.They swam on, and Tidesinger began to feel his need to breathe emerging. Through the tunnel they swam, twisting and turning, towards the islands centre. They finally emerged in a wide open space, and Tidesinger burst out of the water and drew a deep breath.He returned to Kitnee's side, and marvelled at the workmanship of the buildings, laced with intricate patterns and murals. There was a deep rift; a slice in the floor that seemed to go down forever, as if a giant had carved into the floor with an immense blade. Towards this they swam, but they turned to the right and didn't go down. There ahead of them was a building. Its foundations sunk into the shallow waters, but it rose above the waters surface by easily nine metres. It was hollow inside, being one great hall, where all the species of New Atlantis would meet.It was then that a rainbow caught Tidesingers eye. It swept through the sky, and as he followed it to the ground, he realised that its end was at the Guardian. The Guardian, right before him, glistened in all of its glory. The crystal statue of Ecco stood proud, but it was then that Tidesinger realised something was wrong. The crystal form of Ecco was glowing, first red, then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. It was pulsing the colours of the rainbow."Kitnee," he began, "Are the Foe close by?""They can't be. The Guardian can detect any Foe ship approaching Earth from millions of miles away." she replied, "If they are approaching, then we'll know soon enough."As she said that, The Guardian became a deep blue, and a huge laser fired from it, which divided in all directions, following the planets surface. Far away, five explosions were heard."I guess they're still trying. They're persistent, I'll give them that."Tidesinger rose to the surface, exhaled, then took in a deep breath. He swam back beside Kitnee."Where's Ecco?" he asked.Kitnee used her echolocation, and began swimming towards The Guardian. There, close by, was a bottlenose, darting among the shoals of fish. Even from a distance, Tidesinger could see five stars on Ecco's forehead, the shape of a constellation in the night sky. As they approached, Ecco paused, then turned their way. He seemed happy to see Kitnee again.As he approached, Tidesinger felt nervous. Ecco was probably the greatest hero of the sea, and yet he seemed so normal, rather than one of the older dolphins who always told their stories so dull and boring."Hello, Kitnee!" he sang at last."Hello, Ecco, champion of the seas!" laughed Kitnee.Ecco laughed, and then his eyes were drawn towards Tidesinger."And who have we here? And with a blue stripe down both flanks?"Tidesinger didn't reply; he was nervous."Ah, you are Tidesinger I presume? Many stories I've heard about you. You would be almost as well sung about throughout the seas as I am, and that's saying something!""He's very modest." Kitnee told Tidesinger in a low whistle.Tidesinger laughed, "So how have you heard of me? What do these stories say?"That you fight with the most feared of sharks, and come out alive. That you explore the most deadly and treacherous caves and caverns in the ocean, and come out alive." Ecco smiled, "You have my respect already." He swam around Tidesinger, and then asked, "That is a nasty scar. And no shark bite could ever come close to the severity of that."Kitnee told Ecco of the story behind the creature that attacked Tidesinger, and what had happened."Well, it sounds like the Foe, that's for sure. Can you describe it to me?"Tidesinger shuddered at the memory, then described everything. The armour, the tentacles and the shriek."Yes, it definitely is one of the Foe. Strange that you should meet it in this time, when we are most protected. I wonder how it got past The Guardian?""So do we." said Tidesinger."Well, the first problem is how many Foe are out there?" said Ecco, "Next, we need to put every dolphin on full alert. Maybe now would be a good time....." he broke off, as if in another train of thought."What is it?" asked Kitnee."I'll be right back." answered Ecco, "I need to speak to The Guardian."He swam off, leaving Tidesinger and Kitnee wondering just what he was doing.After a few minutes, he returned. "Can you please come with me?" he asked, "There's something important that you must see."Ecco swam towards the rift that they had seen earlier, and Kitnee and Tidesinger swam closely behind.When they reached the rift, Ecco surfaced to breathe, then dived down. Kitnee followed, then Tidesinger, after first taking a breath. It was deep, and dark. They had to rely on their echolocation to get them through. They eventually reached the bottom, which was filled with fish of different colours and species to which Tidesinger had never before set his eyes upon. And there were jellyfish. Hundreds of jellyfish, that floated gently on the waters current. Through these they swam, before finally reaching a huge hole, that looked as if a great drill had just sunk into the ground. It was neat and round, and there once used to be a strong current flowing from it. That was, until Ecco had crashed a boulder into it. The current had stopped, leading to a small alcove where he had found a shard of The Guardian.They swam down, Kitnee only just fitting. Down they went, and to Tidesinger it felt like forever. He felt his need to breathe, but he fought against it for the moment. Ecco swam on, finally turning right into the small alcove. Then he sang a song, which Tidesinger did not recognise, and the rocks seemed to roll aside for him. He swam through, and they followed.There was a small pocket of air, trapped in the rocks, and Ecco and Tidesinger rose to breathe once again. Then back down they went, swimming along the dark passages. After a while, they came out into a cavern, although it was more like a room and had obviously been carved out of the rock. There was machinery, lots of it. The humming of electricity could be heard, and the various clings and clangs from inside the machines made Tidesinger uneasy. There was a glass tube on the far wall, about two meters tall, and Ecco led them towards it."What is this place?" asked Kitnee."It is a laboratory that we created, after I defeated the Foe." explained Ecco, "The Foe have seemed to last generations; I will not. I am not immortal. For this reason, The Guardian and I have been creating a new weapon that can fight them. We made it from the same technology as we made The Guardian, so it will be alive and aware. This is Project Doomtrain, which we made in the utmost secrecy, to guard the waters when I pass from this world."Tidesinger had listened intently, and watched as Ecco moved forward and pushed a button with his snout. The tube drained of liquid, and slowly a the form of a dolphin emerged. However, the dolphin was made of an unknown metal, which looked similar to chrome, and it shone brightly, reflecting the lights of the computers. On its head was engraved a skull and crossbones, the symbol of pirates from long ago. It was neither a 'he' nor a 'she', rather an 'it', for it had no true blood running through it, save for a similar liquid to oil, but not so thick and deadly.Slowly the tube slid down, and the robotic dolphin swam out. For a machine, it moved frightfully realistic and smooth, natural even. Kitnee shuddered."Can it speak?" asked Tidesinger."'It' can, although 'it' may choose not to. Please, refer to Doomtrain as a 'she'." answered Ecco.Then Doomtrain spoke. It sounded unlike a machine, but fluent in the songs of the sea."Hello." she said simply. "I am Doomtrain, and I have been created to destroy the Foe here on Earth."None of them answered."What are your names?" asked Doomtrain."I'm Ecco.""Tidesinger.""I'm Kitnee.""Pleased to meet you.""You too." replied Ecco.Tidesinger and Kitnee were literally speechless. They could think of nothing to say.Then, Ecco motioned for them to follow him, and he led the group out of the cavern. The boulders rolled back into place, and they swam towards The Guardian.Well, thought Tidesinger, we'll have to think of a better name than Doomtrain. Chapter ThreeAnd so it was that the four dolphins of assorted shapes and sizes approached The Guardian. Needless to say, some of the dolphins seemed quite curious about Doomtrain. Some of the braver dolphins came up closer, but none actually came within five meters of them. The Guardian was, as ever, almost multi-coloured in appearance, as the sunlight was refracted through its crystalline form.Ecco asked the group to wait for him whilst he spoke to The Guardian, and then left them again. Tidesinger watched him go, and wondered why they weren't allowed to talk as well. He sighed. Ecco was a hero after all. He still felt troubled about where the Foe were coming from, and he tried to shake it off. He looked into the sky, and he realised that it was almost a day since he was attacked by the Foe, and he wondered if he would have to face one of them again. He hoped not.Kitnee swam beside him, as if sensing his disquiet."What's wrong?" she asked softly.Tidesinger flinched, as if he had been hit. Kitnee moved alongside him and nudged him to the surface. He breathed, then seemed to faint.Then he began twitching violently and shaking, as if he was very cold. To Kitnee, he felt as cold as death.Tidesinger woke, but where he was, he did not know. The water around him was dark, and everything seemed unreal and almost dreamlike. A strange mist seemed to cloud his brain, but he couldn't shake it off. He thought back, remembering Kitnee pushing him to the surface. But he thought further back. There was something nagging him, something about the sun. And then he realised; it was the day after the attack- twenty four hours exactly.With this realisation, the world around him seemed to unravel itself. The fog on his mind lifted, and he stared with wonder at what he saw.It was an old city, built many thousands of years ago. Pillars supported the buildings and algae clung to the crags. It was huge... Easily a hundred miles in every direction from where he was floating. Looking up, he saw that there was a rocky cover to the city, as if it had sunk beneath the rocks themselves. Then Tidesinger realised that the pillars looked like those he had passed outside of New Atlantis. He was in Old Atlantis!There was a hiss, as if steam was rising nearby. Following the sound, Tidesinger found a strong current, which seemed to be flowing down from inside the rocks. With closer inspection, Tidesinger saw that it was escaping from a small crack, barely visible. What lay beyond, he did not know.He was suddenly distracted by another hiss. This one was far more frightening, because it had been made by something. Using his sonar, Tidesinger 'saw' an odd crocodilian shape swimming towards him, except that it was mostly black, with streaks of red. That was all he saw, because then he felt an uneasy feeling rise up inside him, and he suddenly twitched violently, and buckled in the water, before gently rising up. Vaguely, he saw the creature approach him, open its jaws wide. But that was the very last he saw of the creature and Old Atlantis.Tidesingers eyes opened slowly, and Kitnee seemed overjoyed to know that he was okay. He was dazed, and she brought him to the surface to breathe. He exhaled, then drew in oxygen. The dizziness passed."Are you alright?" asked Kitnee.Tidesinger shuddered, and Kitnee thought he was going to spasm again. However, he turned to look at her, then said, "I was just in Old Atlantis.""What? You can' have been. You were right here, all the time.""ou must have been dreaming,"said Doomtrain.It was then that Ecco rejoined the group, and he was told about what had just happened."Old Atlantis? Did it seem real?""Very."Ecco swam around a little in deep thought, "Tell me, Tidesinger. Do you know anything of your heritage?""Not really. My mother was killed by sharks, and my father was last seen here, in Atlantis, nine years ago. But of my deeper ancestry, I know nothing.""Well," said Ecco,"If I may be bold enough to suggest something, will you listen?"Tidesinger drew in his flippers, which in dolphin signalling means yes."Good. Although this may seem far-fetched, The Guardian has told me about a race of dolphins who could seemingly predict future events. A sub-species of Atlantean dolphins, some believe, lesser than the builders, but far more dangerous.""What does that have to do with me?" asked Tidesinger.Ecco paused for a moment, then continued, "The Guardian tells me that these dolphins could be identified by a long, sweeping blue stripe down either flank."Tidesinger didn't move. He stayed motionless in the water for a long time."How..? Are you sure?""Very sure. I have recently seen Trellia, who is a dolphin from the far future. She has told me that things are becoming distorted. Unreal. Her world is falling apart at the seams.""So something is altering the past?" asked Doomtrain."Technically, yes. Although it hasn't started yet in our timeline. Whatever is causing these changes has got to be in our future.""How far away is that? It could be generations before the timelines start getting messed up." noted Kitnee."That's true. Which is why I have taken the liberty of opening the door for you.""The door?""It leads to Old Atlantis. Only Tidesinger may go, and maybe Doomtrain. But Kitnee is too large.""Are you saying I'm fat!?""Kitnee, you're an Orca. You're way bigger than I am." said Tidesinger, grinning, "Besides, I was the only one there in my vision, or whatever it was.""But that doesn't mean that no one else went with you for some of the way." said Doomtrain, "I'm going with you."Ecco agreed, and then said, "Once you get there you will meet many creatures seemingly not of this world. Also, it is possible that some of the Foe are down there. You need to find the time machine built by the Atlanteans and stop Trellia's future from being destroyed. Also, you are certain to meet some of Old Atlantis' guardians. Beware of the legendary Arkonviox, young singer. I have heard of him from the glyphs, but we aren't sure if he or it actually exists.""Why doesn't that make me feel any better?" moaned Tidesinger.Ecco swam around, "Kitnee, if you'd stay with me, we have a lot of catching up to do. As for Tidesinger, go back into the underground cavern. Before you branch right, there is a tiny crack with a strong current running through. It can be broken, if you find out how. Beyond that, the door is open."Tidesinger reluctantly headed for the rift, and Doomtrain followed quickly. As she left, she heard Kitnee cry, "Take care of Tidesinger! Our futures depend on him!" she might have said more, but Doomtrain was out of earshot. Then she swam quickly and followed Tidesinger down into the rift.Chapter FourTidesinger saw Doomtrain following him, and he slowed down to let the mechanical dolphin catch up."Thanks" she said.Tidesinger didn't reply. He felt strangely scared, as if plunged into a nightmare which he knew nothing about. In the twenty four hours, he had been attacked by the Foe, found out he could see the future, and that he had to stop whatever was happening to Trellia's reality. How he could do this, he had no idea. Unilke man, dolphins can't hold weapons, which gave him an extra sense of dismay. How he could fight the Foe, as Ecco had, without the five abilities and songs, was completely beyond him.As he swam down the rift, entering the narrow hole, he found himself wondering what was causing the future to become distorted. Perhaps the Foe had reached the time machine? He didnt know. Also, his vision was bothering him. He knew that soon enough he would be all alone. That didn't appeal to him much, as he remembered the creature that had approached him. It had been shaped like a crocodile, but red and black. Could it be that this was Arkonviox?He shook it off, and with Doomtrain behind him, he paused, listening for the rush of a current. He heard nothing. Doomtrain, however, could hear it perfectly well. She moved up to one of the cave walls, and then she charged.Tidesinger thought she had gone insane, and was charging the wall, but before he could say anything, Doomtrain had vanished, leaving behind a narrow hole. Tidesinger squeezed through.A small air pocket nearby proved useful for Tidesinger, and he surfaced, breathing in. Doomtrain came up alongside him, and much to Tidesingers surprise there wasnt even a dent on her snout. She was obviously made of quality metal."Where are we?" asked Tidesinger.Doomtrain paused, then circled, "It seems that we are in an underground cavern. Just ahead of us is the door that Ecco described.""How did he open it, without going through this wall?""I don't know, but I wouldn't worry about that right now. Come on, let's go!"She dived, and swam through the door.Tidesinger followed, pausing briefly to inspect the beautiful murals, which showed images of the builders of Atlantis, but none of his kind, the prophets. He swam into the darkness behind Doomtrain.They emerged in a vast cavern. It was impossibly large, and it stretched for miles in all directions. Below them were pillars, and buildings, all seeming frozen and lost from the world."Whoa..." marvelled Tidesinger."I'll go on ahead, to see if there is any danger."Tidesinger didn't have time to object. Doomtrain was already far away, and obviously not going to change her mind. So he decide to do a little exploring as well, and hopefully find some air pockets.He swam up, heading towards the caverns roof. There was several air holes, conveniently spaced out every so often so that he could fully explore the city without worrying about oxygen.

Extending it yet again eh Arkie? Well...I can't blame ya. I sorta was hopin' that it would be over before my birthda in march, but oh well. Keep it goin' as long as your gettin' art in Arkie. Keep generating intrest when you can, remind people that it's still goin' on....or else it might die out completely before it's "due date". ^_^;;;

First off Tidesinger...that's cool if you can get the Back button to get back to the topic, then the Forward button takes you back without erasing the text you've already typed. But I've tried that before...I'm not that stupid. Thing is...when I do it...the forum likes to screw with me and all that was previously typed...is lost. Dunno for sure if it's the forum er what...and frankly I don't care...I jus never do it anymore due to the risk. Anyway, it's nice to see the Topic Review at the bottom of the replying window...thanks...  ...now is this somewhat new, or was I just blind before...because I swear it wasn't there when I made my last reply here...heh?!

I read the first few and the last few, I don't have time to read all of them.  As far as I could tell, everyone started talking about boyfriends and girlfriends.  Either way, the subject seems to have strayed far from anything having to do with the Earth Clan.The reason I wasn't paying attention to this topic is because I didn't have anything to say about it.  But I decided that if I'm an Earth Clan member I might as well participate in the forum.

Do you think that, in the future, dolphins and humans will be able to build a new civilization ? A civilization where dolphin kind and human kind will be united ?I think this is possible, if the humans will become wiser and more respectful with nature...

It would take a really long time to read all of those posts.  And when I said that I was talking about at that particular moment I didn't have time.  Well, I might have, except then by the time I finished I wouldn't have had time to do anything else. Besides, I'm just to lazy. Normally I can figure out what'sgoing on by just reading a few posts, but in this case I was simply confused because the subject had changed so much.In any case, I see no point in continuing this.  I should have quit earlier.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I barely remember that story.  I forgot what kinds of characters there are.As for a name....er...I have no idea...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
beautiful character drawing there, Stenellya! i love the patterns all along the body of the dolphin, well done  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That looks really cool!The only problem is, if it has sound, then I won't be able to watch it when my parents aren't around.And what about those who don't have Flash? You should make a non-flash versian, too.  Or else, I suppose you could just say too bad for those who won't take the time to download it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aw, I just missed it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow.  There's so much bull in there, you could open a McDonald's.I don't know what kind of moron would fall for that. And besides, even if dolphins had thumbs, it would be hard for them to do anything like building weapons without having actual hands.  Their fins aren't flexible enough.It might be possible for a dolphin to have some sort of mutation that looked like thumbs, but it takes millions of years for any sort of noticable change to evolve. And I can't imagine any curcumstance where dolphins would be better off with thumbs.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I would never pay to have a website anywhere.  Unless I was using it for something that I was getting money for, like if I ever wanted to start selling my artwork, and only if I could gain a profit.  But nothing like that is ever gonna happen.  I just don't see any point in paying just to have a website, especially if you don't even work on it that much.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
naw tethys i thought about that, since episodes do have to be planned out i might still have time for non flash.i will consider subtitles but relly if you don't have flash you better get it, its becoming a standard, second how can you enjoy the movies without sound? i will consider subtitles though in case you couldnt understand the speech.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Of course its bullshit Tethys... Its from "The Onion" which is a joke newspaper.Heh. Weapons. I don't imagine dolphins really would need those. That rostrum is rather hard, and having a colision with that at around 15-20mph wouldn't be much fun.Then theres the whole question of being slapped with the peduncle. I couldn't imagine that being fun either.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ha ha for a second i believed it, that would be fucking scary if that happened.then when i seen the dolphin formed axe then i knew it was bull. pretty cool dg, im putting that in the hall of shame just cause its wierd

Theres one and pretty much only one reason I have a web host that isn't free.I don't have to put up with the two tons of hassle all the free webhosts make you do now. I used to have a geocities page way way back when geocities wasn't owned by yahoo and didn't have much features, but lacked lame ads and broken javascript.Ah well. Things progress. Everything costs a little something these days, abd belive me, $17 isn't much for having a domain for a year. If you think about it, thats about how much money the average person spends on fuel in a work week.Anyway, we're way way off whatever the topic was here.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow, that's really pretty! Almost butterfly like. I really like the fins.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Nope. No possible way.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think dolphins are probably smarter than humans.  They have bigger brains with twice as many folds (meaning a lot more surface area to perform all of the functions of the cerebral cortex), and they have an organized language that is much more complicated than any human language.  So, I think that even tho they don't have hands, they could probably figure out a way to build things if they really wanted to.  And it's true what DG said.  If humans can't cooperate with each other, it is highly unlikely they would be able to cooperate with a completely different species.Right now people are trapping dolphins in nets, whether it's accidental or not.  And we are taking them from their families, putting them in cages, and making them perform tricks for food, just so that people can be entertained.  So, I don't think the dolphins would be too thrilled with the idea of working with humans, either.

You're  a few wrong, Histronic.Dolphins don't think like humans, but they think !!! It's the most important thing ! If their communication and spirit grow up, they will become more intelligent !They can build things.No the same things than the human kind, but they master the tools and the linguistic syntax. They handle the language and the objects. They can be our equals, but in much better.

Jan 1st 2002?  Hmmm...well, I guess it ended two months ago then.Did you mean June? Or Jan 2003?  June makes more sense cuz I can't imagine you'd extend it for a whole year.I might decide to submit something else because my manatee drawing is getting kinda old. But that is if I ever get around to drawing anything else.

I don't really wanna try talking to my parents about it, there's no point.  I don't think they'd be too thrilled mainly because I'd be sending stuff back and forth to people I never actually met, and they don't trust people on the internet.  If it was possible for me to do it without them knowing about it, I would.  But I would have to get to the post office somehow and I'd have to be able to pay for the shipping, and they would probably wonder about the packages that I'd be receiving.

I've seen both of those movies.  And I don't remember that at all.  But perhaps it's because it was so long ago and I only saw them once and I have a poor memory for everything.

I recomend if any of you are serious about thinking about this topic, that you take some time to go and read a few papers on the subject. Culture in whales and dolphins (Rendell &amp; Whitehead, 2001 Behavorial and Brain Sciences, 24, 309-382)Also the commentary to the above article,Experiments are the key to understanding socially acquired knowledge in cetaceans (Mercado &amp; DeLong, 2001 Behavorial and Brain Sciences, 24, 345)Also these1725)If you can follow along with those, you're well on the way to understanding the very basics of Delphinidae behavorial processes.Tethys, I resent the fact that you felt the need to troll in this thread. I call your attention to a comparative perspective of "signature information" in animal vocalizations. Animal Behaviour 62 (6) You should be able to find all these peer journals in any quality library.)

.. That moderators refrain from editing people's posts needlessly. Its a very bad practice that violates the trust that registered users place in the administration to keep order and perserve the security of their postings and accounts. Rember that when you do this, you're speaking for that user without their permission.

If we want to send a book of our own around too; we could send it in the corresponding order aswell...

Holy, Shadow, you sound like my old Science teacher    As to your last statement there, that kinda depends on what you consider a culture. But you know, Bees and Ants are amazing little thingers, aren't they? I mean, considering they're so damn tiny, it's amazing what they can do as a colony. The fact that they're controlled by a queen is kinda freaky, though. Makes you wonder what goes on in the head of a queen insect... brrrr...

Quick cretique if i may,If the wolf was really femal, she would have not 2, but 6 to 8 breasts.Also, its not weres, its a common human/animal style. Quite a common one at that. O_oThe name weres at that is a name used amound the artists that do this style, the style at that looks the same upon all the artists who do it, so seing it here isnt quite as impressive.

<div id='container'>
Thats great ARkon. Sweet...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm...well thanks for the response Arkon...though I don't know what's wrong. Every time I try to access one of the tracks, by clicking on the links, I get an error message through Real that says "Requested file not found. The link you followed may be outdated or inaccurate." I've checked time and time again, and it seems to give me this message every single time. I've just now tried downloading the RealPlayer again, to see if there was some sort of corrupted file that was causing the trouble...but after downloading it and reinstalling it, I've still got the same problem. Anyway, thanks for trying to help...I guess I just can't listen to 'em... :(

<div id='container'>
Hmm...that's interesting...here's hopin you can get it figured out soon!

dammit now i gotta defend myself.a were is more animal than human, m'kay? they walk digitigrade and do not wear clothes. they tend to be more tribal. furries tend to walk plantigrade, were clothes, and are smaller than weres. they have a more human side.and im not gonna draw 6 boobs on a wolf m'kay? (damn jim henson shrimps~~whats his name?) Dark Natasha did it, and she put it in her Erotic section. im not too keen on drawing that many boobs cuz it loox erotic. its...erf. no. and ive never seen a squirrel were so bleh. *stix tongue out at crestoe* you could say something nice. i worked really hard on these and i like em. its done in MY style, not someone elses. yes, the wolf is similar to dark natashas, but gee i think i mentioned that. it was on purpose, so i could learn. same thing with my dolphins...the way i color phins is very similar to lassens style. not as much as it used to be since ive learned more.*lowers hackles*

Unfortunatley I'm not sure when I'll have my connection back, but until then could you pass this message on to everyone else? The only way I could e-mail you was through school-but those bastards seem to have blocked your site. Well,Good flugs till then, FargalEXSo it appears he's lost his internet, and for those of you that heard a rumor of Fargal being tidesinger, thats not true!Anyhow just passing the message, good to know he isnt dead, or found a better place to hang out.

Oh! oh! and to further prove my point about the breats...i just found this lil bit by Ursula Vernon (whos she? dunno? http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/u/r/ursula/ursula.html there ya go)I will now resolve, once and for all, the issue of whether anthromorphic thingies have eight breasts. Okay. Breasts have two functions, right? First off, nursing young. Animals that bear litters have lots of nipples, so that nobody starves, animals that have one or two offspring at a time have two. Granted the size of these puppies, I'm guessing most of 'em are NOT packing eight 10lb infants in there. Two! Two! Now, moving right along, breasts in humans are a secondary sexual characteristic meant to mimic the shape of the buttocks as part of the evolution of face-to-face copulation--(this is also the reason that humans have lips, and chimps don't, though I'll leave what that's supposed to mimic to your own depraved imaginations)--which evolved when humans switched to a mostly-monogamous social structure, so that you could make sure you were--ah--involved with the proper individual, so to speak. Since no one has eight buttocks, once again, I'm saying that if they have breasts at all, they've got two. Damnit. (Whew. I feel better.) Tune in next week for 'Where do centaurs keep their lungs?'

Regardless, i still stand by my words.Any idiot can go and draw something like that, yer styles not in that. ive seen your style, the style in that looks like my book of illustrated aimals of the world. Which, need i remind you, is not a style. its simply just boring realism and not of any of my interest in your artwork.Theres plenty of people out there who do weres, and what im saying is it all pretty much looks the same. :P

I had trouble hearing the Blundercaves preview without turning it way up.I would just use headphones, but the ones we have won't work and I dodn't know why.  I almost forgot we had them because I never use them for anything anymore.  We used to have a different pair that had volume control on them, but I guess they got lost or something.  It wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the language, especially in All in the Family.  I'm not sure whether or not my parents would have a problem with me listening to stuff like that, but I'm sure they wouldn't want to hear it.The only other thing is that it takes so damn long to load on this browser.But at least it looks really cool.  :)

Well I've seen those documentaries and stuff where they're trying to interpret the dolphins signals and I seem to remember them saying something to the effect of the possiblity.How do we know they don't have an organised language system?  They have so many different sounds.  And they could have variations and pitches that we can't pick up even with the equipment that they use to record the sounds.  After all, it's been recently discovered that elephents communicate with sounds we've never been able to hear before.Besides, all those things were written by humans, of course.  We merely study these animals.  And it's awfully hard to study something outside of captivity that lives in the ocean.  We know very little about the ocean.  Even the blue whale is very hard to track despite its size, and we haven't been able to find out where they go to breed.New discoveries are being made every day.  We don't know as much about other animal species as we think we do.

I think that any more than two breasts looks really gross.I'd like to say something here.  First of all, these creatures have human characteristics, even if they are more animal than human, they still have human-like bodies.  And if you want to make it more accurate to how these animals really are, they wouldn't have breasts at all, just nipples.  Have you ever seen an actual wolf with breasts like that?And, secondly, they are NOT REAL.  Just like any fantasy creature, an artists is open to draw weres, or whatever you prefer to call them, however they want.  It's the artist's interpretation.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(after finally getting a chance to look at this again)Okay Okay! I get it!  It's not my fault I've never seen any of those movies because I thought they all looked really dumb (except for a couple that were mentioned that I never heard of before).I don't even know why I had to go and post in this topic in the first place when it was something I know nothing about.  Well, actually, I was curious to know where these characters came from since I figured they were probably well-known despite the fact I'd never seen them before.  But I have seen the actors, probably just in preveiws tho.Oy.  I kinda just expected one reply telling me what a moron I am or that I must live under a rock or whatever.

No, but the intent is realism, Tethys, so id suggest that you and your ignorance of the subject stay out of it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm backing Vantid on this one - what she found and quoted really did finish  the argument over how many breasts. I've drawn were's before.. never scanned any - but you find it incredibly difficult to draw so many breasts. Also - drawing about 6 on a wolf is rather sickening too - think of the anatomy, one's body would never be able to support that. Point made - its called Artistic Licence.

*shrugs*....I dunno?!? It's still confusing to me how they're supposed to work, eventhough I've gotten them to. I mean, if you ask me...you should be able to just click on the links...and when Real Player has appeared on the screen...it should start playing. But, I found that by right clicking on the links..."Save Target As..." to my computer, downloading them (I guess)...then I can click on the icon put on my computer and Real Player will play 'em.

*nabs tethys* shes right so *nyah nyah* well how should i draw them? all toony like? all cutesy anime or, god forbid, sonic style? no way. realism in fantasy art is important. ive always been more into realism than anything, hence my colored pencil work liek the wolves and phins and other stuff yallve not seen. so of course i want them to look real. and the comment about them looking like something in a field guide...huzzah! realism achieved. and if realism is so boring ok so what? the point is ALSo expression. i tried to go for a sensual look w. the wolf, and a kinda relaxed, facing the breeze look int he squirrel. emotion plays a strong hand in all my work, even more so than trying to get something to look "right" hell, why do you think all those wildlife artists are so dam popular? mainly cuz of theier realism AND emotion depicted in their paintings.*chalx up another point*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The breast thing is aside my point, i said that on the arguement of realism but thats not what im pointing out. All of weres art looks the same.The fact is so many ppl are doing types of furry art that look the same, doing the same weres looking art that alotta the other weres artist do is like someone drawing bara-chans style, the whole thing is crap.My point is quite honestly, i expect so much more out of you and this ongoing usage of over used styles bore me. Yer a good artist but there are so many like you. :PAnd to top this little battle, you cant impress me anymore. i have 5 others in my art class who've done work that looks identicle to yours. I so do miss style. Care to take my arguement to the test? Its all true. Those pics could be under the name of another artist and i bet none of you would recognize it as Vantids, becuz theres no real style in it unless it was one of her original charicters or style. If it had such, then pointing it out would be so easily notable.My part of this point is, artist become great when they do something that no one else has tries, whether it be ideas, stles or so on. Weres is a type of furry, whether ppl say so or not.And if you look at it, theres nothign truly great about it. theres no real good artist in it considering its all the same down to the core.Thats partially why i started this arguement in the first place.Vantid, i love your artwork and everything, but  when it looks like everything else (wether its dolphins in space, which btw i have a picture in my room that looks just like one of yer dolphin/space pictures) or wether it be weres, theres nothing really new to see in any of it.Many of you will probably argue that "She should be able to draw what she wants" Which is understandible, ive heard that one before. Ive also heard "She did it for fun" She did it for fun, yeah. And so did all the other ppl who did it. Theres looks the same. So they are not really accomplishing anything, are they?My furry art style is human/furry, but with my own unique stle, and many have told me out of the human/furry query, mine is the most unique. That was said by fellow artists, and not  my picture viewing posters. I also ask ppl personally for cretiques and build over them.I dont post my furry art here becuz quite frankly i dont need "oh, thats outsranding!" comments from the posters here, i'll post artwork on places, sure. I do it for the artist who requested or did exchange with pics, so everyone can see what my version of it is. And id o expect perhaps one someone to come out of the blue and point out unoriginality or creique on my part.I dont get it too often, but when i do i strive to make it better andmore original.Its when you've been told by fellow artist that you are unique that you know you've accomplished something.Truly, you are unique Vantid, im sorry to say i dont see any of that in weres.

with all due respect dear, im afraid you are confused about "style" and "subject matter". if i were to take a were drawing done by Dark Natasha, Cara mitten, Swifty, Novawolf, Kyoht, Goldenwolf, and ailah, i could say say. "all right this one is ailahs, this one is ky's, this one is swiftys" thats style. its the same subject matter, but it still loox different. if the way i draw them right now aint so original well duh! thats cuz im just starting out. my dolphin w. the earth was my very first dolphin picture colored) that i ever did. i did it 4 years ago, when i was still learning. i copy other peoples stuff yet i add my own flavor to it at first. not much of my own at first, but more and more as time goes on. my newest phin peices are about 95 percent mine (neo and the airskmmer) yet still retain my foundation. i post my art here cuz im happy w. it. cuz my whole frickin life revolves around art at that about all i am. i spent a good 16 hours this past weekend doing art. i also post on other boards for critique. ya, imagine that. im not that big of a show off. ive had Kyoht tell me im unigue. ive heard the same from Goldenwolf, Dark Natasha, and for cripes sake Rod Lawrence, a professional wildlife artist!!!!  and lets not forget my most respected artist AND, im honored to say, Tina Leyk. cuz without her, id be nothing.  *sigh* im sorry but nothing hurts me more than when im told the only thing that keeps me goin in this worl, my art, isnt special or unique. lets not forget my airskimmer, my butterfeather, my demons Ahicuit, the unnamed Darkwolf, Awas, my warped dolphin, mweep-pha!, and even my own self, Vantid. ive never seen a squirrel were so i thought it was unique. then there are things yallve not seen! my style is as such~~realism. lotsa hair and floof. texture. a mood that afflicts the viewer. rich color and tight details. my subject matter? is it unique? no way! i draw weres, furries, demons, dragons, dolphins, wildlife. gee whos done THAT before? but there are my aforementioned creations. so then swiftys art isnt unique? or is it? or how about whitefin? or anyone else here. i think it is. not the subject matter but definately the style. weres are not furries. they are anthos. furries are also anthros. there is also one other division of anthros that i cant thik of right now.and i swera if someone lox this one cuz were having a civilised debate im gonna be pissed.

Anthros and furries and anything else related fall into the smae category, so i would really bother thinking about the other name, Vantid. Is style and subject matter really all that different? Just becuz you were told by professionals that you were unique that i may give a damn? Just becuz you get critiqued and cretiqued back soemhow show make me think yer not a show off?Fuck no. Sorry Vantid, you have the talent, but nothing you've done that ive seen was really all that interesting. Your work cliches that of work done before you. And if thats what you have to do to be called unique then consider THIS artist a quitter.Im done arguing, i only wanted to speak for those who wanted to give an honest opinion vut didnt want to say it themselves. But its how i feel too, on behalf of me and those who see the artist thats work identify with each other.

heh that answered some on my questions.I had a wierd dream that me and a few others got aboard a NASA space ship and went out into space then ended up in some vacum of space that sent us into an earth that different from owrs.It was the same but it was like being in anothe rcountry except you couldnt get home. At the end of this dream i ditched friends i was with to get aboard a ship since the original ship i wa son crash landed and blew up.Heh i was thiking of alot of this questions in my dream though. so my hand would get numb? space isnt as dangerous as people thought but it would still suck to be unprotected in it.strange enough when i was young i always wante to be an astronuat but this dream gor clouded later since i kenw id never visit my favorite planet saturn. for some reason i like mars now since it has "something" that might be able to support life. then theres the zeti reiculi has anyone heard the story of them?

When he went toslaughter the chicken, he tried to leave as much of the neck in tactas he could.  After he chopped off the head, the chicken got up andstarted resuming normal chicken behavior with the other animals, eventhough its head was totally missing!  Olsen figured it might be aninteresting curiosity, and after the chicken was still alive and wellafter a week, he took it into the local university to have scientistsstudy Mike.Scientists discovered that Mike had enough brain stem left to carry onhis normal rooster functions.  Olsen had to feed him with aneyedropper, carefully dropping food into his exposed esophagus.  Mikebecame quite famous, and lived for four and a half years with no head.

*pokits eccochick* heyla you.yeah well itd be nice if dolphins could finally kick some human tail~less ass.  *smirx* some of us really deserve it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A fascinating idea. Is it possible that dolphins have the intelligence, but not the means to communicate with us?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, kool. another newbie! HI! Hope ya gonna be a regular poster and not someone who visits once then leaves!

To this day, the music from the original Megadrive version of Ecco the Dolphin is a major influence on the music I write myself. I seem to recall the best music being from the Deep Water level though. However, in general the Ecco music has always been superb. I own several game soundtracks - Metal Gear Solid and also the complete Final Fantasy VII soundtrack. I want to get hold of the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack next, plus Final Fantasy IX.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, I'm a newbie, just found this site the other day in my search for hints for Defender of the Future on Playstation2. It's great to finally find an Ecco forum!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
DotF for Playstation2 is definitely worth purchasing, I got it on the day of release. It is improved on over the DC version. The graphical effects and controls are smarter, plus there is a new Gallery option which allows you to play all the music tracks without those silly bubble sound effects! On the DC I got stuck on Perpetual Fluidity, but now I have managed to get to Sleeping Forces of Doom which I am finding quite difficult!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
HELP!I have the PS2 version of DotF but cannot get onto either Passageways from Genesis or Pathways from Nowhere. On the Up and Down level, there is no rock to use to swim against the current to the temple to access one of the levels, and then there are no crystals nor a hoop to remove the wind to get into the pool where the second hidden level is found. How on earth do I get to them? They are two of my favourite levels from the Dreamcast version!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hiRichElectric DolphinLightning Flash (charge)lolcheersrich
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
On that level, use your sonar to push the crystals into the white glass in the middle. Also, use it to bounce away those that have been caught by the snake things. Then you will win, it's fairly easy fter a while.

Hi!I am a newbie, just found this forum after searching for a guide to Defender of the Future. Needless to say I was extremely pleased to find a forum devoted to one of my favourite game series' of all-time. The original Ecco the Dolphin game is one of the best videogames ever created in my opinion, and I love DotF too. I never got chance to play any of the other Ecco games. :(

<br />

<div id='container'>
These stages were cut from the PS2 version of the game.

I dont think it really matters, i mean they were just some gay little bonus levels and if you have the dreamcast version you shouldn't really worry....

Hey! Nice to 'meet' you! I'm sure you'll have fun here... it gets... well, what Doomtrain said. ;)

<div id='container'>
Well first i meant that dolphins dont think like umans as in they don't think in the same way.  And by building things i mean making lasting shit and organizing things.  Dolphins dont want to.  They are happy without responsibility.  Dolphins dont want to be like humans, and people (who arent nutters) dont really want to be like dolphins either.Besides with all the brainpower dolphins have a lot of it is devoted to sonar and other functions...  more brain does not equal more abstract thought.

Welcome prime mover!I have to tell you this is the best Ecco the Dolphin website out there and ther eisnt one better if you looked for ages! not one better then this place...im surprised cause your the first person thats come asking about the ps2 ecco and we havent added relly any info about it. to be honest its the same as the dreamcast version with barley anything new except a painting gallery which seems cool.anyhow there isnt anything new nor is there any new codes. the dreamcast version has a secreat level and if its still in the ps2 version accessing it should be the same.anyhow welcome aboard!

I know that Flash movies usually take a while to download.  I was saying that's the only problem with them.I did have a problem with the sound on AOL a while back, you might remember me complaining about it.  So it's possible that there's another problem with the sound.  I almost never have the sound on, so I never know if there's any problem with it.I just wish those stupid headphones would work.

No it was Little Red Hen, with the animals all saying "not I", but it might be that her name was Henny Penny.

Hey guys! Just wanted to let you know about my sites new look! I gave it a face lift, so it's not so cramped and hard to navigate anymore. And anyone who couldn't see it before (because of the floating frames) should be able to now.http://beisick.dolphinparadise.netI've added a forum and a guestbook too. So maybe if you want you could stop by the new board (it's just little), and sign the guestbook if you have a sec. I also put a picture of me in the profile section. Heh heh.Thanks guys! I hope you all like it!Let me know what you think!(it looks best on 800x600 resolution)

Well.  That's a releif.  Now when I go into space I won't have to worry about blowing up.That's an interesting dream, Arkon.  Sometimes I wish I could travel to a parallel universe.  It would be cool to visit another planet, but I'm not too thrilled with the initial process along with the various possible dangers.  But it's nice to know at least I won't blow up.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow, that was short. LOL, I love Bantid's voice!  I couldn't help but laugh every time I heard it! XDA little choppy and slow at times, but hey, no one can be perfect.  It was still good.  I agree not the best Blundercaves ever, but still good.It was plenty entertaining.So, since you've already introduced some other people into the Blundercaves, I'm wondering if I can expect to see some warped version of myself sometime.  After all, there's a lot about me to make fun of.

<div id='container'>
Well I don't remember any of the characters so I have no idea.  You should just go to a bookstore and look for it, or try Amazon.com or barnesandnoble.com (I have no idea if that's hyphened or capitalised).  Or, it would be even better if anyone happens to have a copy.The problem with those children's tales is that most don't have enough characters.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, it's true, I'm sure.  I heard that same story a few years back, on the radio I think.  It is kinda freakish. That chicken acted just as if it still had it's head.  It would peck at the ground and stuff.  Another thing I remember from when I heard that story is that it continued to try to crow, but it just made a gurgling sound.

Spring Break already?  It's not even spring.  Ours starts on the 23rd.  But we aren't going anywhere.  We've already got two trips planned for this year.Well, have fun, Vantid! Altho you're probably gone now.  Hmm...Well, have fun anyway!  :)

Graphics 2Technical 5Remarks:The graphics are pretty good, though effects seem to have been used where character animation would have worked better.Audio... Guys when doing voiceacting, turn up your microphone sample rate, and turn down the gain a little. Make sure you don't have electrical or mechanical background noise. Theres nothing that hurts worse than voice acting that was sampled at the rate of a cheap telephone.Technical,  it seems like you've got quite a large file, for how short it is. Probably the music could get downsampled and looped to cut the size down.Funny.. Hrm. If this was done in the standard format, it would be funny.  The way it is now, it reminds me of a prank conference call. Its supposed to be funny, but the jokes lose the punchlines.Oh, and wheres the violence?

0_o amazon.com?  wow, Chicken Little is a mini story,it can be expanded...Arkonviox can b mentioned as being the king....i could net serch..One day Chicken Little was walking in the woods when --                       KERPLUNK -- an acorn fell on her head                       "Oh my goodness!" said Chicken Little. "The sky is falling! I must                       go and tell the king."  On her way to the king's palace, Chicken Little met Henny Penny. Henny Penny said that she  was going into the woods to hunt for worms.  "Oh no, don't go!" said Chicken Little. "I was there and the sky fell on my head! Come with me  to tell the king."  So Henny Penny joined Chicken Little and they went along and went along as fast as they could.  Soon they met Cocky Locky, who said, "I'm going to the woods to hunt for seeds."  "Oh no, don't go!" said Henny Penny. "The sky is falling there! Come with us to tell the king."  So Cocky Locky joined Henny Penny and Chicken Little, and they went along and went along  as fast as they could.  Soon they met Goosey Poosey, who was planning to go to the woods to look for berries.  "Oh no, don't go!" said Cocky Locky. "The sky is falling there! Come with us to tell the king." So  Goosey Poosey joined Cocky Locky, Henny Penny and Chicken Little, and they went along as  fast as they could.  Then who should appear on the path but sly old Foxy Woxy.  "Where are you going, my fine feathered friends?" asked Foxy Woxy. He spoke in a polite  manner, so as not to frighten them.  "The sky is falling!" cried Chicken Little. "We must tell the king."  "I know a shortcut to the palace," said Foxy woxy sweetly. "Come and follow me."  But wicked Foxy Woxy did not lead the others to the  palace. He led them right up to the entrance of his foxhole.  Once they were inside, Foxy Woxy was planning to gobble  them up!                                                                              Just as Chicken Little and the others were about to go into the fox's hole, they heard a strange  sound and stopped.                It was the king's hunting dogs, growling and howling.                How Foxy Woxy ran, across the meadows and through                the forests, with the hounds close behind. He ran until he                was far, far away and never dared to come back again.  After that day, Chicken Little always carried an umbrella with her  when she walked in the woods. The umbrella was a present from  the king. And if -- KERPLUNK -- an acorn fell, Chicken Little  didn't mind a bit. In fact, she didn't notice it at all.**********             "The Sky is Falling"              aquatint, 14" x 11"                                   ©                                                         CHICKEN LITTLE                                            Chicken Little was in the woods,                                            A seed fell on his tail.

I saw it with my eyes.                                              I heard it with my ears.

He met Turkey Lurkey, Ducky                                            Lucky,                                             and Goosey Loosey.

Well you said you were looking for it, so I was just offering a suggestion..Is that realy how it goes?  I don't remember anything about a king or a fox, I guess I forgot more about it than I thought.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, geeze, anything can sound bad when you break it down like that.

<br />

Ah, I see.Hmm...there's a few people like that in this forum, too.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
In case you forgot, Tethys is one of four Ocean Gaurdians.  Well, I drew one of the others.She is the Indian Ocean Gaurdian and her name is Amphitrite (I beleive it's pronounced "am-fih-try-tee").  The name also comes from Greek Mythology, from the wife of Poseidon and Queen of the Seas.So here is the picture on S7//www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/DisplayImg.pl?INO=103598Basically she's a campchurch, which is really just like a hippocamp except that it's a unicorn.I need to at least come up with names for the other two gaurdians, and if I ever figure out how they look then I will draw them, too.

<div id='container'>
cool! ^_^

<div id='container'>
Very cool.

Violence doesn't make the Blundercaves funny. Half the time that's why I'm like "Wow, that one sucked..."I prefer the jokes.

Hey Teth, that looks awsome! I love how it's a "Sea" "Horse". Hee hee! Very clever. It looks great, and I can't wait to see the other two!

Yah, this is nuts! There are 2 blank canvases in the gallery and 10 unaccounted for vitalits...

Hee hee. Well I was just looking through that Ecco cook book that we have here. I beleive it was Eao's idea, right? Well I think it is a super cute idea, and I want all the levels to be filled up. I contributed mine just now (which are really good, you should try them ^_^), and I'd like to send in some more. It's not hard to take a recipe and jaz it up Ecco style, so if you have a sec, give it a go!It works too. Who ever put in the PB and Jelly sandwhich, gave me a craving for one. Yum!Some people think it's stupid, but I think it's a good idea.   Ah come on, it could get some pretty good stuff in it! And I know Delphi can make some awesome tasting penut butter cookies. ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
from what i heard those vitialits were hidden in the levels, the ones that everyone says are "missing". basicaly they hid new vitalits you got to find
</div>
<br />

Hi! Another new member! :DWelcome to the board! I'd love to see some of your artwork if you'd post it up.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It looks like a jelly gummy? O.x;;Hm, I don't know why you couldn't get in, Eao.  When I was reading the thing about joining, it said they don't judge your artwork.  But maybe they changed it because they were getting too many people wanting to join.  Still, in my opinion, you're a better artist than I am...maybe you should try again.  And actually they don't allow anything with any sort of sexual content, and they don't even like you to post anything for more mature audiences, like nudity.  But they will allow a small ammount as long as it's tasteful and you rate it properly.Ahem...Anyways, I'm glad you guys like my picture.  :) And, no, I did not make up the campchurch. One of my friends asked me if I did.  But I didn't.  It's an actual mythological creature.Gummy gaurdians....-.-;

The last time we got a new computer, we salvaged everything from the old one.  We didn't lose anything.  I don't know how, tho.  I don't know if my mom did it or if she somehow got someone at the shop to do it.So if you do it right, you shouldn't have to lose anything that was saved on your old computer or even on FrontPage.In any case, if your site's still up, you should be able to save all of your pictures and everything else onto your harddrive from your website.  Or you could move all of it's content to another host, most of them provide a means to copy the content of your website onto a new location.And you should be able to reinstall any programs that came from a disc, if you still have the discs.  And if you had anything that was downloaded, you can go back to the site where you got it from and redownload it.I really wish I had a clue how we got everything from the old computer onto this one when we bought it. But there are other things you can do.  Don't lose hope until you've tried.

o_OWell it's definitely different, that for sure! But I'm curious, do you have to have that up on a diff site to put a link in so that your pic comes up? Or can you just put it in from your hard drive? If so, how?

Sorry to hear your mess Swifty. I hope you get all of your stuff back!Well, maybe now you could make a big art site! I was looking through your old site with your dragons and furies on it, and I quiet enjoyed it! Your art is always fun to look at, so maybe if you get a good server? But that's up to you of course. Your the one taking care of it.Good luck though!

quite a lovely drawing there, Tethys, i had no clue there was a species of unicorn/hippocamp... guess one learns something new everyday then! :D i really like the look of it, the fins in replacement of the hoves is quite unique. excellent work with that!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
now that is a nice anthro drawing there! i am already jealous ^_^ love the stripes as well! keep up the good work, Keepiru! would you happen to have anything else to show off?

<div id='container'>
Hello, Keepiru. ;D Wellcome to our waters, hehe. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ah, it has been a long time since i have heard of such old stories... i do remember there being a supposed 'king' that all of the animals believed would solve their problem of a falling sky, but i never heard a version where they actually found the king... in fact, it always ended with the band of animals being eaten by the fox... terribly depressing for a children's tale, i think...this does seem like an interesting story to try and come up with... as long as there aren't any headless chickens walking around gurgling when trying to crow, i would like to join in as well... ^_^however, a name would be fairly difficult for myself... perhaps, NeoGeo?... yeah, i thought it was fairly dumb when i thought of it as well ^^;;  sadly, i fear that i may not be able to actually make it into the tale, but i thought i might as well try out

I decided to forget the other topic. I'll post it up here. Anyway, here comes the next bit.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Chapter FourTidesinger saw Doomtrain following him, and he slowed down to let the mechanical dolphin catch up."Thanks," she said.Tidesinger didn't reply. He felt  strangely scared, as if plunged into a nightmare which he knew nothing about. In the last twenty four hours, he had been attacked by the Foe, found out he could see the future, and that he had to stop whatever was happening to Trellia's reality. How he could do this, he had no idea. Unlike man, dolphins can't hold weapons, which gave him an extra sense of dismay. How he could fight the Foe, as Ecco had, without the five abilities and songs, was completely beyond him.As he swam down the rift, entering the narrow hole, he found himself wondering what was causing the future to become distorted. Perhaps the Foe had reached the time machine? He didn't know. Also, his vision was bothering him. He knew that soon enough he would be all alone. That didn' appeal to him much, as he remembered the creature that had approached him. It had been shaped like a crocodile, but red and black. Could it be that this was Arkonviox?He shook it off, and with Doomtrain behind him, he paused, listening for the rush of a current. He heard nothing. Doomtrain, however, could hear it perfectly well. She moved up to one of the cave walls, and then she charged.Tidesinger thought she had gone insane, and was charging the wall, but before he could say anything, Doomtrain had vanished, leaving behind a narrow hole. Tidesinger squeezed through.A small air pocket nearby proved useful for him, and he surfaced, breathing in. Doomtrain came up alongside him, and much to Tidesingers surprise there wasn't even a dent in her snout. She was obviously made of quality metal."Where are we?" he asked.Doomtrain paused, then circled, "It seems that we are in an underground cavern. Just ahead of us is the door that Ecco described.""How did he open it, without going through this wall?""I don't know, but I wouldn't worry about that right now. Come on, let's go!"She dived, and swam through the door.Tidesinger followed, pausing briefly to inspect the beautiful murals, which showed images of the builders of Atlantis, but none of his kind, the prophets. He swam into the darkness behind Doomtrain.They emerged in a vast cavern. It was impossibly large, and it stretched for miles in all directions. Below them were pillars, and buildings, all seeming frozen and lost from the world."Whoa..." marvelled Tidesinger."I'll go on ahead, to see if there is any danger."Tidesinger didn't have time to object. Doomtrain was already far away, and obviously not going to change her mind. So he decide to do a little exploring as well, and hopefully find some air pockets.He swam up, heading towards the caverns roof. There was several air holes, conveniently spaced out every so often so that he could fully explore the city without worrying about oxygen.Knowing that he didn't need to worry too much about air, he dived. He reached the old marble roads by the ruins in no time. The entire place seemed devoid of life, like the waters where he had first encountered the Foe. He glanced around nervously, firing a few sonar blasts just to make sure. All seemed fine. He swam past a pile of rocks, and up at a low rise. Above here, he could see most of Old Atlantis, spread out in all its glory. Where Doomtrain was, he did not know.He swam through an old ruined temple, getting a distinct feeling of isolation. The light cast strange shadows, and what was more, he didn't know where the light was coming from. There had been no open water that he had seen at the cave top to let sunlight in.Going deeper inside, he saw something. It was shaped oddly, and too smooth to be a rock or part of the seabed. Upon closer inspection, he saw that it was a crystal, but why it was here and what it did he didn't know. He butted it with his snout, but to his surprise as he did so he passed right through it. There was a brief flash.Shocked, Tidesinger turned around, but the crystal had gone. He wondered what had happened, but he felt a kind of energy welling up inside him. Feeling like he was going to explode, his body suddenly became wracked with pain again. He knew what was happening, and he quickly raced out of the building and towards the pockets of air above. The pain got worse, and he had to will himself onward, as he fought to hold back the spasms in his muscles. He was almost there, and suddenly he felt his body go weak and limp, but the shivering continued. He drifted slightly up, but then he began to sink back down because of his weight. He felt detached from himself, as if he were in a dream.Suddenly everything went black.A small prick of light shone through his eyelids, and as he opened them he saw that he was in a completely different place. It was dark, with only a few beams of light. But ahead he saw a group of dolphins. One was long, sleek, with oddly long flippers and a tall dorsal fin. Another was like a normal bottlenose, except there was a strange flash in its eyes, and its skin was pitted with strange, tiny holes. Another was green, which really freaked him out, but stranger was the fact that three green leaves or feathers were protruding from its forehead. Then he recognised two of the others. Doomtrain and Kitnee. Then, he heard a whistle behind him, and he turned around to see himself swimming up a dark tunnel towards the others. His copy swam right through him, like he wasn't there, and that was when he realised I'm not actually here.If that were true, then he wasn't seeing things first hand. He couldn't interact with things. It was like a dream in which he had no control, and he also realised that his last premonition which had shown him the crocodile wasn't as bad an omen as he had thought. It meant that he wouldn't be there himself, as he hadn't seen himself there.He felt like his head was going to explode again.Then he heard a sound which cut through his thoughts, his voice, and it said, "Okay, so here we are. If I can remember right from my premonition, the way through is just through this wall. It isn't real."With that, he swam through the cave wall across from Tidesinger.The others followed.Tidesinger went to follow them, but then he blacked out again, and slowly the real world appeared before his eyes."Wha... What the?" he recoiled, and felt his tail hit something. He was at the surface, so at least he hadn't drowned, but how, he didn't know."Thanks a lot! Is that any way to treat somebody who just saved your life? You tail whipped me!"Tidesinger jumped again, but not as bad as before. He spun around in the water, to be faced by a green dolphin, with three feathers emerging from her head."You...?""You know me? I didn't think we'd met. I would have remembered the blue stripe. It's been a long time since I've seen one of them.""You know of my markings?""Of course I do! You're a sub-Atlantean dolphin. A prophet, I think."Tidesinger didn't say anything to confirm what the green dolphin had said, but he did ask, "You know about others with my markings?""Well, not anymore. The last one I saw was called Callisto, I think.""Callisto?" Tidesinger shrank back, "How long ago was this?""About three years. Why? do you know him?""Yes... He's my father.""So, what's your name?" asked the green dolphin, as they began to swim down into Atlantis."Tidesinger.""Tidesinger, eh? That's an odd name isn't it?""I guess so. What's yours?""Oh, sorry. I forgot! My name is Talyn.""Have you been in Atlantis long?""All my life! Ever since I was a calf. My parents always told me that this place was sacred, and that I must guard it for all of my life."Tidesingers mind began to wander, and he thought back to his father."How do you know my father?""Callisto? We go way back. But I haven't seen him for some time. I remember the last thing he said to me.""Which was?""Talyn, my fate is already sealed. I have seen far into the future, and I know of the course that I must now take. But for you, I have seen nothing, and so you have an open future. But I have seen you travelling with my son, and when he comes here, you must lead him to the time machine. It is the only way to prevent the disasters that are going to plague Earth."Tidesinger paused, "I have also seen into the future. You were travelling with me then.""So that means I go with you." said Talyn, "I don't know what your father meant, but he sounded sad.""Did he have the same markings as me?""Not quite. I'd guess that your mother was a bottlenose, but your father wasn't a cross species. He was a pure Atlantean prophet, which is why you seem to have only just realised your powers. He could see years into the future, but you seem to only be able to predict things days in advance, and you have no control over when you do it. He could be recognised by the blue stripe that you bear, but he also had a long dorsal fin, like Trellia.""Trellia?""A dolphin from the future. She has long flippers and a tall dorsal fin, yet she somehow can levitate above the water and carry another alongside her with telekinetic powers.""The power of the mind?""Yeah."

i dont think that i dive away in a few days... i like this forum and the phins and other merfolk who posts here.maybe ther will be some time without postings from me...my job sometimes cuts me off from the internet.but: i´ll be back! *g*Keepiru, small dolphin

Heh heh. that would be funny.Why is this a sticky?
</div>

<div id='container'>
terribly sorry for the truant reply to this, Doomtrain... i actually like the new navigation system you put up there, the bar to the side makes it much easier to go to the different sections of the site. even though some of the links are cut off to the side, i think one can still understand what they mean...i love the new artwork you put up as well, that screaming cliff one is quite lovely! *evident envy of humanoid artistry very present* ^_^oh, and by the by, the little pic of you at the bottom of the profile section is adorable ;D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's really cool!Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude or anything.  I just get annoyed sometimes by trivial things like that.  Just ignore me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh... x.x Actually it's not that unique...That's the way they're supposed to be.  Hippocamps and campchurches are more traditionally pictured with finned hooves like that.  And even the thing with the ears and the "maine" is how it looked in the picture. You see, I learned of these creatures from an old coloring book on unicorns that I got at a craft and hobby store.  It has information on some different kinds of unicorns, including real one-horned creatures like a specific kind of rhino (I forget which kind for now) and the narwhal (altho it's actually a tusk). It also had something called an almaricorn, which is another kind of sea unicorn but it has some sort of wings and the tail looks more serpant-like. I wish I could come up with something more unique.  I'm just not that creative.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Keep up the good work, Tidey!   :D  It just keeps getting better!But I just can't figure out who is the dolphin with the holes in his/her skin..I don't know who has a character like that.
</div>

<div id='container'>
What?! Some of the stuff got cut off? Argh!!! Is your screen resolution smaller then 800x600? If it is, then that might be it. Ah crap. I'm trying to make it so it looks good on everything.Oh, and thank you for the compliments though! I'm very happy you think I'm good at people, because I never seem to satisfy myself. And you like my profile pic? Hee hee! Thanks! ^_^ My friends say it looks just like me too.

Click the link in my sig to get to the site and look in my Writing section, for those of you who might not have visited the site before but want to now  8) Doomtrain drew me some new pictures, but I've been working on a couple, too, so I'll put those up all together, and I've been working on a few new midis for the place, too. So that should be in an update sometime in the next... month   Anyway, just a little update from me... I hope you guys like the chapter!

http://www.arkonviox.com/allinthefamily/previews/preview.html This is the preview for the All in the family flash production which im currently working on. Although it doesnt show much, aside from the original theme song i had planned, it will also feature new chariters and all kinds of crazy shit. Basicly, the flash movie will be presented as episode 10, which is the last episode of the season. It'll consist of 3 parts. This is a preview of what the charicters will looks like. I'll have 3 previews for the episodes parts, then i will realease the 3 actual episodes. So that'll be awhile, so iw ont be around for a long time. Ive been sick, but im spending my time at home working on my project which'll probably be finished in a month or 2. After that, im going to make the episode Grand Theft Yogoat, which'll also be a flash production. And be on the look out in the future for All in the familys 100% flash recreation!

why would someone waste their time to come in here and post something no one cares about? probably because they've got no real life, or friends, so they'd rather share their pathetic news with people that don't even know them...

i may be a rare occurance, my math skills are poor and the best thing is for me to kill most of the internet time, for *wretches* practice/study. i hate mathit makes me feel idiotic and no matter how those parental/teacher/thingpeople try to make me feel better its still a bunch of crock, and i feel so compled to ram people's head throuh walls when peole with petty problems on and in chat rooms get so much compassion and help, and i sit alone, fearfull and sad. How can I live with being an idot with math?i feel even if i study it won't stick.I -have- to take aldabra and college level math for "graphic art" degree.I cannot rerember my time tables...(some)and you won't care, other people with other people wold cry and pray and support them, but not me... the bete noir.

This is Eao saying this right? I hope so, cause I'll sound stupid if it isn't.Well good luck in your math! You'll get it soon enough!Math is my only good subject. But I wasn't always good at it. I can't do anything I learned grade 7 and lower. I can't multiply or divide normal numbers, but polynomials is easy to me. Then there's social class and english which I always do bad in. Oh well. That's just me. So good luck Eao! I hope you still have time to visit every once in a while.

<div id='container'>
Hey Blu! Hope you can come back for good soon. Nice to hear from you again though.

I used to get good grades in math, I have never been really good, and now I don't even get such good grades anymore.  I've always been really slow at it, I could never do anything in my head except for stuff that I have memorized. I even have trouble doing simple addition with any numbers with more than one digit in my head.  I still have to count on my fingers.  I think that was theonly reason I ever did decently, was because I'm so careful about it because I'm always counting on my fingers if I don't have a calculator.  I use my calculator for everything, for things that most people don't need a calculator for.  Of course sometimes I do something on the calculator and when I see the answer I realize I already knew it.It used to be that I would have trouble grasping a concept in math, but I would get it after a while and once I got it, it would be easy and I'd have no problems.  But last year, there were some things that I just couldn't get, and since then I've been having trouble with a lot of stuff.  I don't remember what it was, but there was one thing we were doing last year, and I was sure I was doing it right, no matter how I looked at it I couldn't find anything that I was doing wrong, and yet I kept getting the wrong answer most of the time.So Eao I know how you feel.  And I do care.  But you can't expect anybody to respond when no one knows you have a problem.

alot of people been having problems latley with coming. which is trowing us down to so many visitors.Well if you can eao try to make it back. I got some of your picts you sent me a while back. Im sorry i havent updated but i too been having problems keeping up the site and trying to work on other things.Im gonna update everyone on it soon. don't worry you wont be missing much and when you get back things will be very different around here.

<div id='container'>
That's what it was, it was polynomials I had so much trouble with, where I thought I was doing it right but I kept getting the wrong answers.  I had a lot of trouble with monomials and binomials too.Now I haven't done them in a while and I can't remember a single thing about them.But the thing I hate more than anything is imaginary numbers. I just cannot handle them.  I can't work with something that I can't interpret.Wait, Eao didn't say anything about leaving.  Just cutting down on internet time to study.

I noticed everyone around here is eithier leaving or becoming some one new so i decided to join the club. the club of changing nicks.ANyhow i have noticed it's about that time to redesign the website, and restructure it.This means that im gonna change how alot of sections are and perhalps shorten how mny sections we have.I want to combine all thr music sections like MP3 Midi and so on into one section where you can download them all in one shot.I also want to change how the fan artwork and fan conatacts and fan fiction sections into something new.the forum wont have any changes to it besides a makeover (even though i just did one) which shouldnt effect the posts or profiles =)Ecco has been kinda dull latley so its time to move into the next phase of history.first was the udnercaves then its downfall then the grow of arkonviox.com then the dark ages then back into the light. Now most people would say this is the era to come to an end...but this site can never die! For im the only ecco the dolphin site on the net and even if ecco becoems history we will live on!I'd hate to call it quits cause things arent going my way. Thats why im gonna start preparing to do something new and different.For now i have to only begin it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I hope you can join us again soon.Man a lot of people are having problems lately that's keeping them from being able to stick around. It's almost like a conspiracy or something.  But I'm sure everyone will come back.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey I'm only keeping this name and avatar for a week.  I only did it because it's my newest character.Arkon, you JUST redesigned the website, why do you need to do it again so soon?  And how can you say Ecco has been kinda dull lately?  Unless something major's changed that I haven't noticed, this web site is about Ecco the Dolphin. What are you gonna do, make it into another Sonic site?Are you really sure this is the ONLY Ecco site out there?  It doesn't seem possible.But, well, whatever.  If it's what you want to do, then go ahead.  I don't really have any problems with it, I just don't think it's necessary at this point.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I agree.  People should not be getting married straight out of high school.  My sister got married at 20, and that turned out to be a disaster.I'm thinking this is that same guy that keeps trying to get on under all sorts of different names.  That's what I was thinking when I first read his post.

Yay, happy birthday Delphi.Now you're old enough to date, and all that much closer to the legal age in canada where you can get totally drunk and start going home with random guys.   Seriously though, have a great day and enjoy it while you can.

Well I finally got the chance to start reading it.  But I didn't get past chapter two, since at the moment I only have a few minutes left.  But I enjoyed what I did read quite a bit.  I like the writing style.  And it seems to be a good story from what I can tell so far, even tho not much has happened yet in the part that I read.  I'll definately have to read the rest when I get the chance.

Hmm..a(b + c) = ab + ac(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2f(x) = x^3; f(2) = 8.etc etc :)Too bad this board doesn't handle Math markup very well.

Aha!  Turn it into Sonco Boulevard!Man ecco sure is getting boring lately i mean come on he doesn't even have a fucking movie.  Neither does Starfox, or any other moviegenic video game, but thats a bitchsession for another time.This place is starting to fucking rot.  Except for a few people, the ecco fans have the combined intelligence of a Carrot Top's career.  In fact, i'm pretty sure that if you left an issue of Seventeen out in the sun for a few days, it would become smarter than your average ecco fan by itself.  But what the hell can we do?

the redesign is basically because when i last did it, i didnt restructure the sections like i normally do.What i want to do is shorten it up a bit because i have way to many sections.The task im gonna do isnt easy and since i have to redo every section anyways i might as well throw in a new look!I know tethys i agree its a dick in the ass but im trying to get back to some serious work. I havent been doing updates cause of alot of issues but if im gonna start doing updates again i have to be organized and i learned some new tricks i want to applie.The better news also is i may be throwing in jobs again so people can help me do sections plus even throw in a free dreamweaver to make updating the site for others a whole lot easier.The forum is gonna be updated too, it's that tme to do an upgrade on it since i heard a new version has been released with simple bug fixes. The posts wont be affected since i have the ability to back them up into one small file which couldnt be done on older forums- how about that!So how will it benefit you guys? well if your up to it you'll have jobs of updating site sections. There will be a new section specifically for the fans with information about them and artwork and storys.finally once its all done we can get this site back on the ball and i can use my great abilitie to bring in the fans.

Is this the thing that always has an underscore before the e-mail address?  I got one that appeared to be from Arkon, and one that appeared to be from Crestoe, and one that had an e-mail address that I didn't recognize (_trixie2@mindspring.com).  They all had "RE:" as the subject and nothing in the letter body, and each one had a completely different file attached.  I opened one and Norton AntiVirus detected a virus on it, so I used the option to delete it.  I'm not sure how it works, because I don't have Crestoe in my address book and I don't remember ever seeing that other address before.

Hey Arkon, I think it's a great idea! You do have a lot of little sections that could go with others. It is a little hard to find what your looking for sometimes too. So this change will definatly be for the better. It's going to be great I'm sure!I don't know how I can help, but if you need something I might be able to do, just ask. ^_^ Gool luck Ark!

Geez, Shadow, make us all look like idiots, why don't you?   Algebra is evil shit. I'm doing it in math right now. Good thing my Math teacher kicks total ass... but either way, polynomials make me feel really stupid. I swear, I never walked out of that class knowing what I was doing. Fortunately, I get rational expressions... which is what I'm doing now.But some other fun stuff is Gravimetric Stoichiometry! Chemistry is wonderful  :? Well actually, it's fun. But it's a pain in the arse.

In fact, i'm pretty sure that if you left an issue of Seventeen out in the sun for a few days, it would become smarter than your average ecco fan by itself.  But what the hell can we do?So, Hist, are you calling yourself stupid?Ahem...Well, actually I wouldn't mind helping out if I could, and if you're going to give out jobs I wouldn't mind having one.  But I barely even work on my own websites.  And I've started getting requests again.  Well actually I've had one request and two exchanges, but before I got that request it had been a few years since I'd gotten any.  So it's possible I may be back in business.  And when I start going to college in the fall, and probably working part time to help with my tuition, I'm going to have even less time than I do now.  But I could still do something, as long as I don't have to do a lot.  Maybe I could work on fan sections cuz then I just wait until someone sends something in, as long as people don't start sending in a bunch of stuf on a daily basis.  I dunno, just a thought.  It may even be better for me to not do anything at all.

One of which was the Final Fantasy Movie...I love that movie! Uhh...the bubbly from my Dad, fifty bucks from my Mom, and two action figures for my collections from my bro'. One of S.S. Trunks from DBZ, and the other is a kickass dragon made by McFarlane Toys (the dude who makes all those neat lookin' spawn toys and stuff). It's from a game called Ultima Online....I've never seen the game, but the dragon action figure kicks butt....the wings are translucent, and they even put in blood veins that you can see inside when light shimmers through the wings. I would have bought myself something, but I'm broke and still have a whole week to go before next payday.  XD

Arkon, you should make a Blundercaves about this guy who keeps trying to get on under all these different names, which all happen to be really stupid.  He could be like a spy or something who's a "master" of disguise except that all his disguises suck.  I dunno, maybe it's a dumb idea.

Happy birthday, Swift!  :D Wow, you're 24? I had no clue there was anyone that old on this forum.  That means you're just 6 days younger than my sister.

I think that'd be good to do an overall reorganization of all yer sections Arkon...always makes things look a bit more tidy. I really like the new color scheme for the forum (or at least it's different from last time I saw)... :D ...it totally matches the whole site better! Good luck with all you're about to be doing!

I liked math when I was in school...I guess because I was pretty good at it also. If you're not good at it...makes sense not to like it...heh! Anyway, here's a tip for ya guys... Hold up both hands, palms down, with all fingers spread out. Say you want to know what 9 x 4 is, quickly...and the memory thing ain't happenin. Start with your pinky on your Left hand, and count inward to your right, 4 (pinky is 1...ring finger is 2...middle finger is 3...index finger is 4). On the number you're multiplying by 9, in this case 4...hold that finger down. Count the number of fingers to the left of that finger, in this case there's 3...then count the number of fingers to the right of that, in this case there's 6. Put 3 and 6 together and you've got 36. Easily counted on your fingers you can quickly figure out that 9 x 4 = 36...and it's that simple! Sounds a bit harder than it really is only because I'm trying to type everything instead of visually showing you. So, anyway...try 9 x 7 ...start counting out seven with your fingers (this time needing both hands), starting with the left pinky. You should end with 7 on your right index finger. With that finger held down, there's 6 fingers to the left of it, and 3 fingers to the right of it...thus making the answer to 9 x 7 = 63! Have ya caught on yet...?...or have I lost ya!?Anyway, I think it's a pretty cool trick to quickly get your answer for the 9s multiplication tables... :D

Besides we already have Tidey-Widey which sounds very similar.  Just not quite as funny.Or you could do Angie-Wangie, you know for Angelfin. Eh...then again Plushie-Wushie still sounds better.For the two alternatives I had I'm thinking that I like Tethy-Wethy better.

Hahahah...you guys are so out of it...man...!!! Well, it's been 10 days since my last visit here...mostly because on the 6th of March, I received my new PS2 version of Ecco The DolphinDAlso...Prime Mover...in addition to this forum, might I also suggest taking a look at GameFAQs.com...for they have a specific message board for Defender of the Future on PS2. If you come here with questions and can't get any help, try there also... ;) ...that's where I hang out too to talk about Ecco for PS2!There's lots of tiny little differences with the PS2 version versus the DC one. I'd enlighten you all on it but not one of you with the exception of Prime Mover seems interested. I think the improvements made on the game were incredible! But, again, I'm not sure if you all want to hear about it...so, in the even that you do...speak up...I'd be happy to talk about Ecco's new port!

Stoichiometry?  GAH! I hate that!  I hate it with a passion!  I hated Chemistry and I hated Physics even more.Actually I've always been pretty good at Geometry, that is if I can remember the formulas.  My Geometry teacher in 10th grade was awesome.  He was hilarious.  He taught us things like "armpit Z" (it's a name he gave to one of those congruent angle thingies, I can't remember what it's really called, but it's like shaped like a Z, or sometimes an N, and the "armpits" of the Z are congruent) and Oscar Had A Hit Of Acid--or A Heap Of Apples but that's not as fun (that's the Sin, Cos, Tan thing--OH/AH/OA), and it was hilarious how he showed us why you can't devide by zero (even tho we'd already learned that) but you would have to see it.8 times 8 is 64, shut your mouth and close the door. (my 4th grade teacher taught us that, but he said "close your mouth and shut the door" because he didn't like us to say "shut your mouth" but we switched it around anyway, it sounds better that way).

You should have one for "I want to get it but Idon't have a PS2."Of course, I don't have a PS2 myself, but I don't really care about it since I already have the DC versian.  And I've still only played it about a total of three times and never got past the Perils of the Coral Reef or whatever that level was called.

Hey would anyone happen to have any ideas what the other two could possibly be?  They're both males, since I already decided being that there's 4 they're should be two males and two females.  I already know that the Arctic Ocean Gaurdian will be white, and it should be something small since it's a small ocean.  But then again the northern seas have a lot of huge critters up there.  And the Pacific Ocean Gaurdian will probably be blue, and most likely big, larger than Tethys.I need to at least come up with names.  Both Tethys and Amphitrite come from Greek Mythology, but I don't think I can use Greek names for all of them, altho I'd like to.  The only names I know of that are associated with the sea, besides a few nymphs which are inherantly female, are Oceanus, Poseidon, and Triton.  Oceanus, besides being painfully obvious, is the name of Tethys' husband, so that would be awkward.  And Amphitrite is Poseidon's wife, so that would also be a bit awkward.  And Triton is Poseidon's son, plus it can also be associated both with The Little Mermaid (King Triton) and a giant fork.  The only Roman name I know is Neptune, which is the same as Poseidon so it'd still be slightly awkward, and it's a planet.  Does anybody know any other water gods or anything like that associated with water?  That would be very helpful.Oh, yes, thanks DG.  I'm just glad so far no one else seems to think it looks like candy...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ooops, sorry about that Tethys...thanks for correcting my mistake though. If I could figure out how to edit the poll, I would...but I can't...heh! Oh well...I guess just answer the question to the best of your ability...or with in mind "if you had a PS2"...er, whatever. Anyway, that's truely a shame you haven't played past Perils of the Coral Reef! Yer missing out on the bulk of the game! I soooo want to help you get past where exactly it is  you're stuck...that is, if you're interested... :) ...just let me know!

I said "that's the plan" because it's possible I could get tempted, but I doubt if I would.  I made a vow to myself years ago, and my close friends share the same view.For one thing I never liked the smell of beer.I know an occasional drink won't hurt, but it's better safe than sorry.  One could easily lead to more, and then that could lead to a problem.  Plus, I don't have any reason to drink.  I don't need any of the calming effects that it supposedly gives, I certainly don't want to get drunk.  There are plenty of things that come in non-alcoholic versians so why get a pina colada or something with alcohol in it when I can get it without and still enjoy the taste.  People who need to drink to have fun are pathetic.  That's just my opinion.When it comes right down to it, I don't have a reason to drink and I can't imagine that I ever will, so why should I.

I too think the PS2 version is superb, definitely an improvement over the DC original which was excellent too. I had an inkling that the secret levels might become unlocked once the game was completed. Woohoo! I love those levels so much, completely pointless but takes me back to the Megadrive days...  ( Has anyone found out how to get it in the gallery at all, as it seems to be the only piece of music missing and I love it!

Heres some big news.it will be a while until we get a new "look" but the reorganization will take place as soon as tuesday and be finished by at least thursday.I want to introduce two new Arkonviox.com almost mini sites if you will.One will be fanfare.arkonviox.com that will be an entire fan mini site for ecco fans to have sections with artwork and fan fiction and even a members profile. as if each member had there own mini section for the site. it will include a member profile as well as character profile and an intire mini site section for each user with art and stories and poetry.Also i will have another mini site called soundtracks.arkonviox.com which will have a sound library containing all types of music format or at least a combined section for all the music formats this site has like mp3 and midi and so on.I am considering giving maintainers to these sections if anyones interested. that means you will be in charge of an email account i.e. "fanfare@arkonviox.com" and have to update regularly anything people send for the fan fare section.those who help out i will provide with all the tools nessary as well as help to work on the actual section. you will get your own tool for setting up and updating the section without worrying about having to use pure html.Qualifications are you just have to damn well a little html as well as be up to regularly updating and adding on.I don't want lazy workers only someone whos gonna work hard and get art fan fiction poems up on demand.i relly hope i can have people who will join. the tools i will provide is dreamweaver and the program is about 28 megs large so you have to be willing to download it.also note that the section im gonna have you working on wont be ready for quiet a while since its alot of work to lay it out and so forth.unlike before when i assigned site jobs this will be different since you will actualy be gettig a premade section with tools right in front of you. let me know swhos interested thanks.~Dark Orca

I got Ecco for PS2 and i hate to say it but its not relly worth it if you have the dreamcast version.The gam is dead on the same without two levels from the dreamcast version "passages from genesis" "pathways from nowhere"i eman theres things to make the game easier as well as a little controller vibration but relly the only reason you would be getting it is for the new art gallery which is nothingbecause pretty soon i'll just have that art gallery on my site anyways.i got it anyways since im an ecco collector to begin with plsu i wanted to find the new vitalit locations for if i get around to a new walkthrough for ps2 users.my advice if you got the money to waste for a new ps2 game get grand theft auto or final fantasy 10 unless you never played ecco dof and dont have it for dreamcast- if so get the damned game its fucking good but dont get it if you have it for dreamcast its a waste.Also i thought id add my thoery for why the two levels arent in the game. it appears that acclaim decided not to put them in and didn't dare trie finishing the game. they left a clue that the way to passages from genesis is there but no way to get there since the stone you pushing through the current isnt there. if you did manage to get down there you wont be able to access the level anyways since i betcha access is blocked and youd be swimming into a wall.same for pathways to nowhere. i assume if you got there youd be stuck in that pool and the little star to take you to the next level wouldnt have any effect as well.but if anything very special does turn up that makes this version worth it i'll let you know. (only things that i could think of to make the game worth it is if you could turn into a shark or codes thatmade ecco into a god with all abilities like power of sonar charge and all of that activated to make the game more itneresting. for now youd have to get a game shark and hope such a code is found.also maybe if there was more secreats the dc version didnt have. but other then that there isnt anything to make this version 100% worth it.I hate to bad mouth but i was expecting alot from the fanfarei been hearing but things turned out like i thought. its the same damned game~Rating don't get it if you already have it for dreamcast, your gonna be dissappointed (like getting the game again) take it from Dark Orca the god of this website!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey prime mover i like the face pict!anyhow from what i noticed the music gallery only allows you to play four songs from the different worlds.im pretty sure if you want that song it should be out of the excerpt collection in my mp3 section for dof. im sorry to say im not sure which one.better news is i will be adding all those music's from themusic gallery to my site soon. as mp3's! i couldnt do it before because if i recodered it off the dreamcast there would be water sound effects. with the ps2 its so easy to extract those songs but the song from the meteshephere shrine i cant relly say if its possible to get it. in the music gallery probably not but getting it from the damned game without having to hear ocean noises or sound effects is diificult.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i hate to say it but im a little dissappointed with how appaloosa/accliam lacked on advertising the new ecco game.plus i expected a bigger new ecco fan base but from what i seen so far its only improved the ecco community slightly. only so many new fans i get alot of emails asking for ps2 codes as well as help like walkthroughs but again i tell them the same thing there isnt any damned codes and as for walktrhoughs consult the dreamcast walkthrough for dof sincethe games pretty much the same except maybe a few new vitalit locations.in any matter i want to make a guide but by the time its out with my progress it will be when ecco fans die out and people getboard of ps2 ecco and by the time 10 guides come out.

<div id='container'>
It's not that I'm stuck--I couldn't beat that shark but I only tried twice, and there were two vitalits that I couldn't find but that's not important--it's just that I simply haven't played it.  I don't play video games much these days.  And for that reason I haven't beaten ANY of my DC games except for MKG (which was a dissapointment) and SA1. Of course, I only have a total of 5 games...In the case with Ecco, I started playing the other games that I got after that, and then I kinda forgot about it.  And I just haven't gotten around to playing it again.

i been using pagemill for a long time to build every version of my site that exists and if i'm using dreamweaver to build my current one then doesnt that mean something? of course it does it means its the best!any one who codes out of pure html is an idiot, i hate to offend alot of people but most all webmasters don't code there html themselves they user dreamweaver or frontpage and we all know front page is sorry (i don't know that im just syaing that cause i hate microsoft)the point is they won't fuck up the code for the section if they used dreamweaver. everytime i gave out a template for the site it would get altred and the tables would get messed up. besides if i support dreamweaver id expect anyone who wants to help out to support it too. then i can pin point problems easier and don't have to answer stupid lame html questions.

Butterfly was 35 years old.... O_o;O_o... 35 years old, what the..? Uhm Crest.... Isn't Butterfly's e-mail by any chance "fuckyou@generic.de"? the reason I ask this is because when I was at the old Undercaves, I remember there was some guy whose E-mail was fuckyou@generic.de, and he was like, 30 years old 8O . He was quoted (I think) as saying something like this) HAPPY B-DAY Swiftie. 8)

Actually Arkon, if you look around you'll notice that very few professional web developers write static HTML anymore. Even HTML4.0 is something of a depricated standard. Most sites are written with JSP, ASP, PHP or some combination of the sort. ColdFusion servlets seem popular too. The point is that all these are written by hand, from a layup doc, just like any other development project. The idea behind all this is to seperate content development from the site layout development, such that the site frame becomes an application in itself, rather than just something thats delivered via the session layer. When the display application is a "black box", theres no need to worry about templating or the such, because the content datasource isn't directly displayed. In fact in most cases the data source is not SGML to start with.Histronic is right when he points out that Dreamweaver is not the end-all solution to websites. All that dreamweaver, pagemill, etc do is make an intergrated development environment to generate static HTML. Nothing more, nothing less. You still have to know HTML to create elements that don't conflict with eachother; its not a black box where you just put content in and get source out.
</div>

<div id='container'>
I know how to do HTML don't get me wrong and i know dreamweaver can't do it all.But for those who don't know HTML worth shit and just have a job of updating a simple premade section and if they can do it perhalps enhance it a little dreamwevaver is perfect.Dolphin right now were not ready for what your describing. when i learn php perhalps i will rebuild enigma. but for now were not gonna move in that era not yet...

ah, yes... i recall seeing the original ecco commercial somewhere on the net. it was that jeaques custeu rip with the guys on the boat playing the ecco game, right? never did see that on tv, nor have i seen one for ToT... would you happen to possess both, arkon? if you ever get the time, though, i would definitely like to check those out when they are uploaded  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I'm glad to see you've come back Prime Mover... :) ...seeya around!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe...actually, Friecco...I do remember something to that effect. You and yer lil bro (Cortex was what he went by if I'm not mistaken) were gone for quite some time due to computer problems...heh...interesting thinking back to the old days...eh?!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aye Arkon, remember how I did the Mods and Gyms pages a while back? That was with SIMPLE TEXT. I had what, 2 errors that wern't biggies. You should see what I can do with the template you gave me a while back for this design in simple text - my point is, you don't always need some flashy programme to do something for your site - just knowledge.

Perhaps there's more differences than you all think between the DC and the PS2 version...ehem...let me explain just one here. On the DC...under Audio Options, there's no way to turn off the sound effects. The only thing you can do is decrease/turn off the music. I wonder why they didn't include the option to change the sound effect volume, as most games do have it. Anyway, the PS2 seemed to include it though... ;) ...you can control the volume of both sound effects and music! So, that should prove to be very useful in making MP3s outa the music now (one small note though is some background music can't be heard when playing the game that way...only at certain sections will the music then start up - still awesome though)! One thing I noticed though...if you have the sound effects turned all the way down, you won't be able to hear the songs in the music section of the Gallery for the movies (the middle circle). But, all the others will work. And, about those music tracks available in the Gallery of the PS2 version...there's 6 selections each from Island of Tranquility, Man's Nightmare, and Dolphin's Nightmare. There's only 3 however from Domain of the Enemy. That makes 21 music tracks available from the game itself, and 6 additional including the music for the movies. After some searching and comparing, it appears there were also 21 music tracks to listen to under the Audio Options in the DC version...so, that's probably why there was only 21 in the PS2 version...however they added the movie music...which I think is cool. The only thing is it has the dialogue and background noises...so, it's not technically just the music...but hey - I'm not complaining!Oh! And, as far as the specific music track you're looking for Prime Mover...indeed it sucks that it's not in the music section of the Gallery...but thanks to Arkon and his resourses...you can hear it by accessing it through this site! Actually, Tim Follin...the major music composer for the game's music...has his own website where you can get all the available excerpts in MP3 format. You can get them through this site by clicking on the MP3 section under Downloads. The excerpt that sounds most like the music at the end of the level, Roaring Forces...is the Atlantis one. If you want to hear a much longer version (since the excerpt is only a mere 2 minutes)...check out the Real Audio section under the Downloads as well. There, you'll find a near 7 minute version titled Roaring Forces - Transform (no.12) that is what I believe the music you're looking for! So, anyway, check them out! And, perhaps after Arkon's realized you can turn the sound effects off in the PS2 version...we'll have lots of new MP3s... :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yea...they'd be awesome to see! Anyway, Tethys...you really should get back to playing Ecco! Hopefully you'll have time soon to get back into it... ;) ...it really is awesome!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Uh...heheh...hello?!? Earth to Arkon?!? You must not have read my post in the other topic on this board about the "secret levels in the PS2 version" that Prime Mover had created...heh! If you had...you would've seen my reply about that. This was the key paragraph to readD"So...I know you don't like to read long posts...but sometimes...hehe...it's worth it! Bottom line...(and here I'll say it in bold and big print for yer benefit)...THEY DID NOT TAKE THOSE LEVELS OUT! ... ;) ...yes...you heard correct...Passage from Genesis and Pathways from Nowhere are indeed playable in the PS2 version!I also have to correct you...in that...there is indeed a reason to get this...afterall,  you wouldn't have. You said yourself you got it being the Ecco collector you are...so, that's a reason in itself. Besides, I think it's pretty cool to play throug it again, with better graphics...amazing color improvement...easier control...little differences here and there...and new surprises that weren't in the DC version. Mainly the Gallery, yes...and you can view it on the net...but that takes the fun outa unlocking each picture on your own! Anyway, I supposed I'd better stop...I know none of what I say you're going to agree with...but...I just had to let you in on the fact that those two levels are in the PS2 version...heh!

</div>

<div id='container'>
I think i rember that the music tracks in DC games are actually Redbook audio tracks. You might be able to rip them with a standard CD ripper prog.Someone will figure out how to do it for PS2 games, too.

i agree w. Ti. ive saw the film over the break and while it had its funny parts, it paled in comparison to mallrats and Dogma, which is my all time fave.now Rat Race...that was one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long, long time.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, my God, it *sparkles*! You're KIDDING ME! Okay, so they let you play those levels but only if you beat the game. Big deal.Guess I'm just not as much of an Ecco fan as you two. Even if I had a PS2 I wouldn't bother getting the new version. It's just pointless if the game is the same, you know? I could see if they put like five new levels in, made it radically different, but... what the hell otherwise. At least that's the way I think.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Meh. Well, as long as I know one person is reading it, then I'll continue. If no one were to read it, though, I wouldn't bother. I mean, if the Ecco community doesn't read it, what the hell is the point in writing it?

<br />

<div id='container'>
thats sounds pretty cool for ps2 fans but i think the reason it didnt appeal to me much was i was hoping for different suprises like better morphs or something.i out played the game and the new one didnt appeal to me. besides im more of an old school ecco fan. the new school is nice but as i play more and more im begining to udnerstand what many have said about david brin fucking up the game. the foe world relly was a disappointment as were the intire foe race themselves.but the dolphins nightmare world was my favorite world and the mutaclone. though mans nightmare had its moments too.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it hought only certain tracks from the dreamcast version where but if thats the case dolphin i shouldhave tried itlong time ago. interesting.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well i hate to have to take on my customary role as forum asshole but why the hell is it so important that you change your names in the first place?Gee and I always thought you enjoyed being an asshole.I changed my name when I came up with my new character, Amphitrite.  I just decided that I wanted to use that name for a while, in kind of a celebration I guess.  Altho I wouldn't really call it that since it's kind of ridiculous to celebrate the fact that you've come up with a new character.  And it's just like Arkon said, it's for fun. My plan was to keep it for about a week, mostly because it seemed ridiculous to keep it for only a day or two, and then switch back.  And when I tried three times in a row and it wouldn't let me change it back, I complained to Arkon.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah yes.  The FOIL method.  Which is oh so fun.

"holy squid on a stick"! that is amazing, Swifty, i really love that one! two of my favorite beings, dolphins and dragons, all put together conveniently in one picture ^_^ excellent work there!and eao, did you do that drawing of your char just with a mouse? that is really good as well! *dies from computer art talent overload* o.Xonce again, good job with those!  :D

The reason i dont like builders is it causes people of every level of stupidity to go ahead and make a website.  Or for these terms, volunter to help make one. And i fear we will get some hopeless ass cases to do something.And i do everything with straight html.... i know xtremecco's not much but i can do better trust me.  I'm just really fucking lazy.  I challenge anyone to do something html with a builder that i can't do with notepad.  Besides, i like html.  i find it relaxing  :)

I think the thing that most of you dont realize is this person is probably just a prepubescent kid.  He makes up a new identity -and- life story every time he tries to get it.  Criminy if i remember correctly he thought he was an elf for awhile too.  We are able to figure out it is him because all his stories have a common thread, and that is that they all suck.

You can use a mouse to draw oekaki pictures Doom'. Oekaki is a program as far as I know....not sure how to get it.  If I could, I'd get one. But I dunno where to look. Maybe Shadow does...   Here's a bit of useless info'. Oekaki is actually the japanese word for "drawing" or "draw"...not sure exactly which....I heard it explained once. XD

Uh, you're not making a whole pile of sense yourself there, Hist...I remember those Choose Your Own Adventure books... I hated them.

Hey, welcome to the board!    It's always nice to have new members, especially when they're not one-time posters.

Well first of all, Amphitrite is actually a nereid (sea nymph) and Tethys is a titaness.But in any case this is not meant to be the Amphitrite of Greek mythology. If you read my original post more carefully, you would see that I said that's where I got the name from.  My characters Amphitrite and Tethys are simply named after the characters from Greek mythology.  They are not the same.You know what I found?  In my GeoScience textbook (which is really the same as Earth Science but thename of the course was changed some years ago), I was skimming thru the chapters that we skipped, being that one of them was probably the most interesting chapter in the whole book (about dinosaurs and other prehistoric critters).  And what I found, not in the dinosaur chapter but the one after that talked about how the continents drifted apart, there was a figure showing how the earth looked with Pangaea and the ocean Panthalassa, and then another one showing 135 million years ago when there were two continents The TETHYS Sea!  Okay, maybe none of the rest of you care, but I thought it was cool. There was also two other figures and one of them showed how the continents are now, but it said "present day."  I'd really like to find out when the oceans first looked how they do now, or at least when the earth first had four seperate oceans.  Then I can figure out how old Tethys and Amphitrite and the others are. (and this post was much longer than I intended)
</div>

<div id='container'>
Why thank you Tethys.  It is impossible for me to bestow all my wisdom apon you all in just one post.  It will take at least 2 posts (I finally read a book).  :-)

My math teacher always says it 'First Outers Inners Last'. But my math teacher rocks, as I've said. He's hilarious. He was teaching us to factor binomials, and instead of writing an actual binomial in the question, he drew this little picture of Mr. T (you guys know who Mr. T is, right?), He did it to prove a point, which was that the (b-4) or whatever it was was ONE item. So he's like "I can factor a b minus 4 or a Mr. T, they're both one thing." He also told a group of grade seven kids that they needed something called a 'Gonculator' for math class, and they actually believed him and went out to try and find one... And he was telling us about those 'Difference of Squares' questions once, and he was like 'No, you can't take the square root of 2. Because it's an ugly number. It comes to like (some random decimal number), and the square root of three comes to (some random decimal again)... and just in case you guys are wondering, no, I don't actually know those decimals, I'm just pulling them off the top of my head. But you believed I knew 'em, didn't you? You're all looking at me like "Wow, he knows that stuff? Good for him!"'Funny. But I'm not liking Chemistry very much. See my other post for why. ;)

Hiya! You seem like an interesting...but hyper...individual. =)Coolness.to make arkon mad, just don't let your jaw drop when he unveals something of his own creation. Trust me, works every time!...BWA HA HA!

<div id='container'>
Me, hyper?  No....  I say why be dull and negative online?  That's what the real world is for.  But thanks for the complement.

WOW Swift, that is incredible! How can you possibly do that?? And Eao, yours is also really good!I've tried Oekaki a couple times but I couldn't do it.  I can't draw with a mouse worth shit.  I need one of those tablets, but I don't know where to get one or how much they cost.  I never even saw one before.But there's one major problem with the Oekaki.  What if you'redoing something big and complicated like thatand you spend a couple hours on it and you're almost done, and then your internet loses connection or your computer freezes up or the program shuts down or something like that happens.  You can't save it, so you're stuck.

Hey, I thought this was kind of funny... just thought I'd share my wonderful adventure in the Science Lab with you all.The Adventures of Delphi and Friend in Chemistry ClassOnce upon a time, Delphi was working on a lab for Chemistry with one of her friends from the class. Friend measured out the chemicals they needed for the lab and put them in graduated cylinders, then put them on one of the counters near a sink. One of the chemicals splashed on Friend's hand and she reached over to the sink to turn the water on to wash it off. She hit one of the cylinders, that one hit the other, and both of the cylinders, full of stuff, fell in the sink and shattered.Delphi and Friend were staring stupidly at the stuff when Ms. Chemistry Teacher came over and said "This isn't a good way to start off, you two," in a very nasty tone of voice. Friend was freaked out and said she was sorry, because Ms. Chemistry Teacher is not a very nice lady. Ms. Chemistry Teacher didn't say anything and walked away to get Delphi and Friend two new cylinders while the Lab Tech cleaned the sink out and threw the broken glass away (and she was nice about it, unlike Ms. Chemistry Teacher). When Ms. Chemistry Teacher gave Delphi and Friend their new cylinders, she told them to be careful with them, and she walked off.Delphi told Friend that she was sure the bitch had broken a few of 'em in her lifetime, so she could shut up. Friend and Delphi laughed, and kept on with their lab.Well, a little while into their lab, Delphi and Friend became confused about the directions they'd been told to follow. Friend suggested that they add the first chemical to the next, and Delphi was so confused that she had no idea. The girls poured the aforementioned chemicals into one small, 100mL beaker, and they soon realized that they should have poured the chemicals into the other, BIGGER beaker. Well, too late to do anything about it now. Of course, who should come over at that moment but *SURPRISE SURPRISE*, Ms. Chemistry Teacher. Ms. Chemistry Teacher was not at all pleased with Delphi and Friend, telling them that she would "Really appreciate it if they would follow directions, because they were setting themselves up for errors and accidents." Both Delphi and Friend knew this to be true, but they couldn't believe their luck. Why Ms. Chemistry Teacher had chosen that particular moment to walk over to their lab counter was beyond them. But oh well, shit happens.Soon enough Delphi and Friend discovered the error of their ways, however, because when they tried to pour their new chemical into a filter to filter out the newly formed precipitate, they found that their beaker was too full and the chemical started to run out of the beaker and onto the lab counter (just a bit, shh!). Of course Ms. Chemistry Teacher happened to be there at the moment, but Delphi mopped the chemical up with a paper towel before she could see the spill. It was no big deal, all the stuff had been was basically baking soda and salt water formed in the reaction, nothing poisonous. Joy.So, by the end of the lab, Delphi and Friend had lost quite a bit of their precipitate and had thereby probably blown their lab results. They were allowed a 10% margin of error, which they probably overshot by about 80%. Delphi was reading the requirements for the lab, and one part of it was "Indicate any possible sources of error". Delphi found this rather hilarious, showed it to Friend, and both of them went into stitches laughing. Finally, the lab was over, and Delphi and Friend left the lab feeling rather sheepish but very happy they hadn't done anything worse than they had. Friend went to write a math exam, and Delphi went to Social class to watch a movie about the FLQ. It had been a very interesting Chemistry class.EndSo yeah, if any of you think you had a bad day at school, just read that. You'll feel better.

Actually when I waslittle I used to love those books. I thought they were fun.  There were some where I couldn't get to the good ending no matter what.  But I usually was able to get there.  Of course, I usually did it by looking at both choices and seeing if one of them led to an end.  And then I'd just go to the one that led to another choice.  And if they both did, then I'd skim thru each one to see which seemed better.  And if neither worked, I'd just backtrack.  Sometimes I'd even start in the middle. The first books like that that I read were Mario Bros.  In those ones, some of the choices were accompanied by a puzzle.  And if you could complete it, it would lead you to the right choice.  Of course, I still looked ahead if I was unsure.  I also had some Goosebumps ones, too.I don't know what made me like those books. But I was just a little kid, and those usually are targeted for little kids.

Too many after school programs?That has been my opinion for as longas I've known what alcohol is.  I've always associated drugs and alcohol with all the bad stuff I was told about it as a kid in elementary school.  Itwas when I was alittle kid that I decided I'd never lay ahand on thatstuff,and that opinion was enforced when I was in 5th grade--at that school, all 5th graders had to go thru a DARE program, which I just happened to enjoy.

Don't worry, the last online forum I took over claimed mutiny and I was casted out.  So I learned my lesson... for now!!! WHAA HA HA HA HA.... oh who am I kidding... I got nothing
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's cool you've got a good math teacher Delphi... ;) ...that sometimes makes all the difference in the world! I had a really cool math teacher in 10th grade...he was a lot how you described yours...made going to class fun ya know. Chemistry...yeesch...I didn't like that class one bit! Interesting enough, I had a "not so great" teacher. Maybe that's why. Don't get me wrong...he was sorta nice...but, his monotone voice made it hard to listen to lectures/note taking...and just...made it all that more difficult...heh!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...someone with a pretty good sense of humor too... :D ...that's always nice! Corvoire...eh...just how do you pronounce yer nick anyway? Does it have like, some french style to it er something...heh...? No biggie, just curious is all... ;) ...anyway, welcome to the board once again...glad to see you're still posting!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well that's pretty cool Tethys... :) ...learning about stuff like that has always interested me...and the fact that it'll help you out with your characters and such...is an awesome added bonus...huh!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I pronounce it like CORE-V-WAR.  I suppose it's got a french sound to it.  I have no idea how I came up with it... just another odd thing that spewed from my mouth.  And there's plenty more where that came from!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I see...well thanks for answering my question Swift... ?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheheh...well, thanks for the pronunciation lesson... ;) ...now I can actually understand what I'm typing when I type yer nick...corvoire! Yup...definitely french-ish...hehe...cool!

Wow, you'd think after four years of french class I'd might be ableto come up with somethng better than "corvoire."  Oh well.....  Do I need to go through an initiation or something like that to be a full memeber of this forum?  It's been a while since I had a good paddeling.  "Thank you Sir, may I have another?"  HELLS NO!!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...nah...we don't really do stuff like that here. As far as I'm concerned...yer already a member... ;) ...I mean, heck...ya've posted a decent number by now, seems like ya aren't going to be like the "one-time-posters" we all gripe about...hehe! Jus keep comin...and you'll do just fine! So, are you an Ecco fan? How'd ya find this place...?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hahahaha... :D ...quite an enjoyable story there Delphi...thanks for sharin! Sounds like despite the mishaps, at least you two were able to laugh about it...that's good...hehe! Brings back my Chemistry days...although I hated that class...the labs were always pretty fun and interesting! If ya ever have more stories...feel free to post 'em...I'll read it... ;)

Heh...why is it when people make right choices, they get razzed on...?...or at least, that's how it seems to quite frequently be.

Don'tcha ya'll worry.  You'll be sick of me before long.  I luved Ecco since it first came out on the Sega Genesis.  Hell, the two Ecco games are the only reason I still have the Genesis and Sega CD.  How did I find this sight?  One day I was searching for animal porn and...... just kidding!  :::roll:  I was just looking for anything cool about Ecco (what the hell are Ecco shoes?  I saw like eleventy billion sights about them!) and I found Arkonvoix.com.  I visited every now and then and finally decided to join the forum (lucky you).  I really don't bring much to the table except my natural charm, whit, and love.... I just got kicked out, didn't I?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hahahahhaha...ecco shoes...hehehe! I remember typing "Ecco" into the search engines long ago and seeing it pull up sites about those shoes...heheh! Sorry, I just found it funny you mentioned it...heh! Anyway, that's cool...I'm glad you finally decided to take part in the forum... :D ...seeya around!

i agree with Hist, the person who writes these cannot be mentaly healthy, and if they aren't they're worse off than those who are.I make more sence than these, the only one that remotly goes anywhere is the book one, and whats with the scribbles?  and the strike throughs.is a 6 yr old writing these!?  damn, give me "Jack" anyday, Dave at least has brainswww.http//jack.keenspace.com

If I may be so bold to inquire, but who the hell is this Scott Zeal guy?  Thirakaga, don't even bother trying to steal my wallet.  You'd pick the thing up and open it and say, "Damn.... you should be robbing me!"  I glad to be part of the pschopathic Ecco lovers community... :::::: I feel so welcome..... I promised myself I wouldn't cry.....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh.corvoire, for some crazy reason, you remind me of Nakai ;)Scott Zeal is some loser dude that keeps trying to come around here and get cybersex. Or something equally dumb.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, lucky for you I don't have the kinda coordination to cybersex.  Ya know.... trying it type at the same time.... I just can't do it.  I must be some sort of talent... I dunno.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, a tablet is a device that you plug into your computer using a usb port. It looks like a mouse pad, and it's about the same size as one. The tablet that I got from Van' has a pen-mouse and an actual wireless mouse that came with it. It's really cool. It's real handy if you draw using adobe photoshop and even painter. I find it much more responsive than the old mouse I used to use....but leaning using a mouse gives you a distinct advantage, if your good with it...you can get really good with a tablet. *wonders if she makes any sense* :P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's cool...(carefully types out new alias)...Thirakaga... :D ...have fun with drama! That was one of my favorites in High School...as well as when I went on to college...heh! Gotta love those types of classes... ;) ...oh, and keep up the good Home Ec. skills!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...*laughs a bit at Whitefin's dialogue*...ah ahhahahah...*the some more at corvoire's witty humor*...yer too funny man! Say, why don't you stop by the chat sometime... :D

Heh heh. Just Delphi's luck. I hate Chem though. It's so easy, yet no one in my class can get it. I don't get it?
</div>

<div id='container'>
Well good for you! don't you deserve a gold star or maybe a war medal for making such moral choices! now that we've heard your extremely, shall we say, saintly opinion, shut up and let the rest of us drink ourselves into hell...oh and because nobody likes a bragging "virgin" or condesending goody two shoes. don't knock it till you've tried it
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, you're right DG. Heh heh. This is getting interesting though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
For being so talkitiveI really don't say much do I?   :D   If ya'll like smart-asses then ya'll should love me!!!  When are you guys usually in the chatroom?  Oh, got to go.... Scott Zeal is trying to cyber with me.   lllaaattteee.

This is  just a crap as preview i made, to show the mouth movements mainly. The animation is crap but bare with me, the real thing will be way better.note that this scene has nothing to do with the episode im making, just a quick skit to test the voices out.This quick-script was made by my friend Sonic3D40 who dissapeared from the internet totally in november, so this pays hommage to his work in a way.http://arkonviox.com/allinthefamily/previews/crap_ass.swfA couple of ppl said i sound like arkon, which isnt exactly true. my voice is deeper than his, and it didnt really fit with the charicters. so i speeded it up and it fit right in, so their you have it.This is a short skit, so dont expect too much from it.

Yeah, my Chemistry teacher isn't very nice (which is evident from my 'So Typical' post.. ;) ), but for the most part I find actually doing Chemistry fun. For some reason I enjoy the Gravimetric Stoichiometry. But only when I get it   My Band teacher is a bitch (and also my TA. Lucky me), my Gym teacher is pretty cool, and my Social teacher is... well, I don't know yet. She takes these HUGE breaths when she talks to us. She's like "*GASP*And so today we're going to talk about the *GASP* FLQ. I know some of you may not find it the *GASP* most interesting subject..." ... It's kinda like she's overdoing the breathing skills in public speaking.

The times differe for everyone, and I've lately not been around as much as I used to...but I think the times it's most full is 2-5pm PT...maybe...correct me if I'm wrong people. Anyway, just mozy on in sometime... :D ...seeya!

<div id='container'>
Hahahah...Jader...and how old are you?...*shakes head*...you soooo shouldn't make presumptions about people you don't know...you really have no clue about me. I was merely making an observation. And, to respond to yer last statement, "don't knock it till you've tried it"...I already have tried it...probably more than you have (in a lot of aspects) ...so would that mean you're giving me permission now to "knock" it if I so desire...?...hmmm...?!? So, now that you've made your condescending remarks to people who are merely expressing an opinion and/or their values...why don't you shut the hell up!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah...heheh...well here's hopin anyway... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh, Dg, dont fuck with kids these days. We've probably done anything and everything way more many times then you have. ;)Just let them knock back and few cold ones and maybe get knocked up in the process and have themselves a good time.Besides, niether of you are right. Its the individuals decision to themself thats right. And right to them alone.But dont get me wrong, im not againts drinking. Its just that you non drinkers sound like truth commercials and after schools specials. :) And Jader, we have enough smart asses that arent smart. And dg, we know you've been there done that. I recall you saying sopmethign in the chat once, but i dare not repeat it. o.o;

Alright... It took my long enough, but I finally finished that mirror pic I got some of your opinions on. I decided to run with the  city vs. nature idea, since there were a few people that had a similar idea. So thanks you guys!Tell me what you think.

Er...Thats one weird site...Hey shadow, I like your Signature because I am doing this research on Starlin and I know all this neat stuff,and I think he says that on C&amp;C:red alert, but none of that now, I haff a few questions...Does anyone know who whitefin is?I see his/her name on many posts, but they have never seemed to make one.Does anyone know what causes mercury (The metal) to move?Anyone here like Warhammer? Im not really a fan of the game, im more of a painter and a conversionist.

Hey shadow thanks a million, I do know where the term Quicksilver came from though... In latin terms quick means not fast but alive, so to them mercury seemed alive and a silvery colour thus:quicksilver. Thanks for telling me who "Whitefin" is, Is there any special requirements for the art contest, for I plan to enter.Even though Im not too good an artist in my opinion or maybe in just modest...Thanks again.

It may just be my computer, but the sound didn't match up with the animations in even the slightest bit.  It was still in the first panel when the dialouge was all over and then the rest had no sound at all.  I hope I don't have the same problem with the actual episodes.  I didn't have any problems with the Blundercaves episode.

Well...in 7th grade I had Speech/Drama, in 8th grade I took Theater, and in 9th grade I took Speech (which is a required course ).  They were all semester classes, but I had the same teacher for all three.  And he was one of the coolest teachers I ever had.  He was really funny. And, of course, being a Speech teacher, he was a very good speaker.  I shouldn't say "was," he still is.  (Hm...how come someone who does a "spEEch" is a "spEAker"?).  He also directed the plays at the Jr. High.One of my other favorite teachers was also one that I had three years in a row.  In 7th grade, I had Health &amp; Wellness, in 8th grade Topics for Teens (which was pretty much another health class), and in 9th grade Health and Wellness again (I wouldn't have taken it before if I had known it was required in High School).  I had these during the sememesters that I didn't have the Speech/Drama/Theater classes.  My teacher for these classes was really nice and she cares a lot about her students.  Ah, I forgot to mention they both taught mornings at the high school and afternoons at the jr. high.My fourth grade teacher was really cool.  He was fun.  He let us out to recess a lot, but that's not the only reason I liked him.  He was just great.  But he didn't teach us much.And I think I already mentioned my Geometry teacher.  That was a class I had in tenth grade.  He always told us stories and he's really funny.  It was the one class where I actually wanted to pay attention cuz you never knew what he was gonna say next, and it was sure to be something funny.So those are the teachers that made my list of favorites.  But I actually liked almost all of my teachers.  In fact, I never actually had a teacher that I really didn't like until high school.  And I never had a teacher that was actually mean.

My name really doesn't mean anything.  I created it by sounding out letters that would sound good in the appropiate places.  In other words, I just pulled it out of my ass!  It's like I always say, "The answers are up there somewhere.... You just need to dig deep to find 'em"

I read in a magazine that some levels from "Ecco 1" and "Ecco 2 - ToT" have been remodelled in 3D in "Ecco:DoTF".Is it true ? And, if it's true, what levels ?

Hmm. Well, I'm working on a fanfic in progress myself right now, and I'm always willing to discuss story ideas! Feel free to drop me an e-mail, a private message, or hey, put it all up here, if you like.

<div id='container'>
I'm thinking they're talking about the levels "Pathways to Nowhere" and "Passages from Genesis". If so, then yes, it's true in a way. They aren't actually levels from Ecco 1 and Tides of Time, just the fact that you get to play them as sidescrolling levels makes them like the old games.

I'm still working out the plot to my Ecco/ dolphin story, plus the fact that I have an Anthro story, Vampire slayer story, and this one in the works... Oy... think I got too much?Hope you like...Cerulean SkiesChapter 1The Ferashi AssassinationLocation Terra IITime00 hoursThe sky had already began to darken as a solitary figure rushed through the alleyway of a big business building. Her long black cloak billowed out from behind her, revealing the silvery iron of a Cougar Magnum attached to her belt. Her attire was all black to conceal her slim figure in the night of Terra II&amp;#8217;s most visited city, Sedern. The largely populated urban area held the tallest buildings in the Solar system, and second only to those of Trevan II. Massive architectures of concrete and steel loomed over the woman, and cast long shadows like hands reaching out. Most windows were dark, foreboding and concealed those of murderers and innocents alike. The crescent moon hovered in the blackish-blue sky, alone and deprived of the shimmering stars that accompanied it in the heavens above. The city lights dimming the natural beauties from the onlookers&amp;#8217; eyes.To the young warrior it was a bad omen for her; not being able to see the heaven&amp;#8217;s gems was bad luck, at least that is what her instructor had preached. The wind howled like a lone wolf, and old newspapers skidded over the black tar. Somewhere near the woman a cat mewed from behind a garbage can laying on its side, with wasted garbage spilling out of its contents. At least they weren&amp;#8217;t full of homeless people, the littered place was bad enough already. The smell was intolerable, tainted with the buzzing of flies and maggots chewing away as if in a paradise, and she had gagged many times from the stench. She was careful to pick her way through the waste in order not to damage her black clothes. Her oval shaped face was pale, almost white to compensate her nationality of the United Kingdom. Locks of baby blue hair spilled out from her baseball cap hanging past her shoulders, while her eyes remained unidentified behind the glasses she wore in a bluish tint. The heavy sounds of her black boots echoed over the walls of the business buildings that surround her from east to west.  Nearing the dead end of the alley, which was clearly marked by a chain mesh fence surrounded by boxes of cardboard and more garbage cans. The woman slowed her paces to a halt as she laid a pale hand onto the cold metal, turning her head to stare up at the corporate building, Ferashi Interplanetary Inc. with a stern expression forming in her angelic face. She reached over to her belt and grabbed a radio from it with a small tug. A simple press of the button sent the radio on, with a crackling of static being all she could hear at first from the ear piece in her left ear, and she winced from the loud scratching sounds that raged war on her eardrum. The static soon faded and the deep, masculine voice replaced the annoying noise.&amp;#8220;Vela? What is it?&amp;#8221; the words of her beloved twin brother were short, and in the midst of it, he sounded a little bored. Even when she tried not to, she had to smile at that tone of his.&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m in the alleyway next to the target. So get your butt in gear and help me!&amp;#8221; Vela scolded into the metallic box, narrowing her wide eyes of navy blue when she heard his laugh echoing in her mind. &amp;#8220;You didn&amp;#8217;t have to smell this shit down here, Juno! Now hurry up!&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Alright, alright! I&amp;#8217;ll be there in a few minutes.&amp;#8221; Juno&amp;#8217;s voice faded out, and Vela turned the radio off and hitched it to her belt once more. With an already frustrated look, the young officer from the Federation&amp;#8217;s Jet Force military leant against the steel creation with her arms crossed. Why couldn&amp;#8217;t she have done the easy part of infiltrating the building, instead of her brother? She was just as good at playing the role of a perspective creditor for the company, but in truth she knew what General Larkin was putting in consideration; the twins pros and cons. While Vela filled an extra course in the academy&amp;#8217;s schedule with more spy and target training, Juno had taken up learning different fields in business and politics. Now he had a chance to test his memory, and apparently done an excellent job&amp;#8230; as usual.&lt;Probably to forget about Miryani. &gt; She thought to herself with a frown forming as she looked over the filthy alley, and wondered how someone could live in a place like this. Her thoughts diminished completely as a thick strand of rope hit the brim of her cap, knocking it forwards just slightly. Vela, with a grunt of surprise, placed the hat back onto her head comfortably, and turned to look up at the gray building; seeing the disappearance of Juno&amp;#8217;s palms, retreating into the window of the twentieth floor of the one hundred and fifty floored building. Sighing, she grabbed the thick rope and tied it tightly around her slim waist, and gave a tug at the end of it when she was finished. The rope tightened, and with Juno&amp;#8217;s strength, she felt her feet lifting off the pavement and began to rise from the black cement. Vela let herself fall backwards and into an almost horizontal position as she let her feet touch the cemented frame. With her brother still pulling her up, she scaled the building with slow and steady paces, her mind completely focused on the task at hand.  She was at the seventeenth floor, when a sudden flash of luminous light hit her shaded eyes. In the icy grip of terror she felt at being caught, she swung her body away from the window on the left, her foot barely stable on the sill&amp;#8217;s edge. Vela quickly took notice of the dangling strand of slackened rope just within view of the window&amp;#8217;s position, and pulled it towards her with hope of not attracting the security. She had already tugged on the rope twice, ceasing Juno&amp;#8217;s pull; and when she looked up she could see the worried expression on her brother&amp;#8217;s face, although the lack of light shadowed much of his face. Vela felt her entire body go rigid as the adrenaline entered her bloodstream, awaiting the guard to open the window and look out and catch her. But nothing had happened, as the guard figured that he must have imagined whatever it was, and the fluorescent rods turned off. She exhaled the breath of air she had held in her lungs and her brother had started to pull her up once more towards the twentieth floor.It was a few minutes until her brother&amp;#8217;s strong arms lifted her through the window and into the pitch-black room that was an executive&amp;#8217;s office. Vela had taken the opportunity to remove her favorite pair of glasses and tucked them safely inside her cloak, blinking her wide eyes as Juno turned on a flashlight directed towards her. She took the handle of the torch, while he turned on the other one that he had taken for himself. Vela was already scrutinizing the large cedar desk, that held several neat tan folders, an expensive computer, several pads of paper and pens, as well as a business type phone in milk white color. Vela could tell by just looking at the desk this person hated clutter with a passion. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve already checked the folders atop the desk, they hold nothing on that virus.&amp;#8221; Juno muttered barely audible to his twin. Vela looked up from reading the somewhat boring files, staring at him before nodding and placing it back with the others. &amp;#8220;Well, do you know where they would hold files on their weaponry and such?&amp;#8221;Juno nodded, &amp;#8220;Yes, I know it&amp;#8217;s on the top floor. A secret passage is inside Ferashi&amp;#8217;s office. I didn&amp;#8217;t get a chance to check for it though, but that&amp;#8217;s what I overheard some scientists saying.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8220;Than what are we waiting for? Lead the way O&amp;#8217; Great One.&amp;#8221;Juno sighed inwardly at Vela&amp;#8217;s last comment. He knew well she was only joking but he had never tried to sound bossy when giving orders, and just the fact she says things like that can aggravate him. He turned on the heel of his black leathered shoe, and headed for the large steel door that led into the main hallway and stairs. His suit&amp;#8217;s pants made little swishing noises as he walked, but took little notice of it. The large jacket he wore over his broad shoulders was also black, with a white silk shirt and black tie hidden under the collar. Vela had made a joke that if he dyed his hair black he&amp;#8217;d look like the legendary James Bond, much to his amusement. Attached to his belt were two silenced pistols, and a few smoke grenades. A thick belt lay over his shoulder, where a shotgun hung from it, glinting its cobalt blue finish in the light of Vela&amp;#8217;s flashlight. A light sound of the sliding door opening into the dimly lit hall met the ears of the two Gemini fighters. A wave of darkness swallowed them up as they passed through the doorway, and the soft hiss of the door shutting after them closed them off from the organized office. Juno looked about from where Vela&amp;#8217;s flashlight touched Gemini BasePlanet 09 Goldwood Parliament, Iredea CityTime00Planet Ceí Apartments, Kolue Planet 14:06A siren went off in the distance, as thunderheads black as the night rolled in from the heavens above. Streetlights came on as the shadows fell, and the beginning of the first raindrops hit the dirty streets. The capitol of Kontra, Kolue was facing its third storm this week, apparently coming from swamps that came from the southeast as they normally do. Lightening flashed above, skittering over the clouds before striking a nearby tower, shaking it slightly. The Rosian technology was great though, the lights remained on and all equipment was normal. Two tall and dark figures, both male, ran out from the alley to escape the storm. Leaving behind the dead and now decaying body of some anonymous whore, that had been murdered after giving them what they had wanted. The rain came down faster, mixing the thick blood that flowed freely from her neck and cooling it faster. Her eyes had been left opened to stare without emotion as her soul left her body, just like the others who perished in this unforgiving city. Only the strongest could hope to survive these streets.In one of the large towers, a part of the apartment Ceí, a young man appearing in his early twenties set down to count the money from his recent murder. Being a contract killer had its advantages. The room was large, an old-fashioned cathedral ceiling where a small chandelier of crystal hung and refracted the light of the lamps in an array of the prettiest rainbow. The walls were painted a faint ghost green with molding in redwood, the doors remained white. On one side of the room stood a large bookcase that held the novels of some of the greatest writers from Terra, the likes of Stephen King and Tom Clancy, along with an old, deteriorating book from the late Edgar Allen Poe. The chairs were of leather in hunter green, with dark cedar along with it. A coffee table in the same wood held a small reading lamp and a fairytale book that still held a bookmark in it.On the other, a large entertainment center with one of the biggest television sets to ever be seen. Speakers surrounded the room, hidden within the walls, yet never played loudly or risk breaking the 10 000 mear chandelier. A couch, also in hunter green leather faced the set along with several chairs, where several gaming platforms sat in silence. The carpet was thick and plush, a deep viridian shade that set the whole room apart from the others.   The man sat in one the old fashioned chairs, counting the money that had been changed from Terra II&amp;#8217;s dollar bills to the Rosian currency. His hair was the darkest of brown possible appearing as a fine inky black almost. His face pale and hard, reflecting the seriousness he portrayed in his line of work. The fine clothes he wore to hide his nudity were of the most expensive cloth that could be found. The wealth that was witnessed through him and his home made people realize one of Rosia&amp;#8217;s top assassins, but what made him stand out the most, were his eyes. They the brightest pair of blue anyone would ever see, and matched the sands of Cerulean. Narrow, focused, and intense are words many used to describe him after just looking into his eyes. They were a window to his very being, but whether they were open or not were of his own option. Jake Sheldon sighed as he leant backwards into his chair, staring at the large pile of money before him. It wasn&amp;#8217;t the same without his sister here, but she stated some business that needed to be taken care of. He shouldn&amp;#8217;t worry for her, she survived the streets of Kolue, and this was one city that decides whether you live or not. The door had swung open quickly, almost threatening to put a dent into the expensive wall before Iris caught it. The pale woman, stood upright, embarrassed by her rude entrance. The ivy colored gown she wore covered all of her body, aside from her neck and face.

Sorry, but you're wrong. With dynamic IP addresses, anyone in the same IP rotary is going to draw from the same set of IPs.Your example is like saying that 165.121.117.43, 165.121.117.45, 165.121.117.62 are probably the same, where in reality those IPs change hands between a few thousand users on an average of every 4 hours.I'm not really getting after you over your actions. I'm getting after you because you don't seem to get the idea that dynamic IPs arn't a trustable source of authentication.

I caught you red handed! your ip matches the one of my banned list when an ip matches a pattern to someone else it means your using the same computer.Your pattern matched and guess what? Be careful when saying this. Addresses that are dynamic pools are not the same user, and IP is not a valid form of identification. In fact, most of the time, outside of your own network segment, reliance on IP information is inherently poor because it places the web of trust on a untrustable source.Addresses in the form *.dialup.xtra.co.nz match almost all of NZ since its Auckland Telecom Internet Services, addresses 210.55.144.0 - 210.55.159.255, or about 4000 IP addresses...Its even worse if you wanna talk addresses like AOL or Mindspring. (All AOL users appear as one of 10 or so cache*www.aol.com, mindspring uses a single addressing block for the entire united states)

Well congratulations Whitefin... ;) ...I remember doing that same sort of blindfolded excercise back when I was in school...ah the memories! Anyway, corvoire and Friecco...?...nah, maybe at first glance...but when you get to talk to him more...he's definitely got a different personality (meaning that in a good way, of course)... :D

everyone usualy uses aim. but im gonna get a new program that has aim, icq, yim, and all them great programs all in one eventualy.

I don't use AIM...I think it sucks...it annoys the hell outa me when I use it, so instead, I use Y!M... :D ...and it suits me just fine! But, I know lots of other people like AIM...so...to each his own.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, I think the new section is great! I like the way it looks...the setup...navitation...you did an awesome job on it there, Arkon... ;) ...one thing I noticed though...some peoples' descriptions of themselves don't appear right. It's as if the box is too short and some of their text doesn't appear. Not a big deal of course...but...just something I happened to notice. Anyway, congratulations on getting the new section up...looks good!
</div>

Well Friday I didn't actually look at everything, but now that I had, I noticed the same the DG said about the descriptions, and I was going to metion it but she beat me to it.Crestoe's archive doesn't work.Also, one other thing is that most images come up in a seperate window, but there's a couple that come up in the same window, and so when I went to close just the image I ended up closing the whole site.  It's not a big deal, but it's annoying.But as I said so far it's pretty good and I know that once you get everything up and all fixed it will be really cool.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey... :D ...those were pretty awesome there Shadow! Thanks for sharin! I had fun revisiting some of my old time favorite video games...heheh! By the way...you aren't Robb are you...? Who ever he is...he did a great job on all of those! Thanks again for the link... ;)

What is AIM ?

<br />

<div id='container'>
i already fixed that problem with the images opening up.as for the descriptions, alot of those people didn't send descriptions to me so i had to use old ones. if you dont submit everything out of the list to me your box will look alot shorter. unless its soemthing different thats my only explaination.

I started laughing almost right away.  I wonder if anybody can actually pass that.

AOL's (America On Line) Instant Messaging program. It's a form of chatting with people over the internet. You don't need to have AOL to use it, just go to their site and download it for free. Y!M is Yahoo! Messenger...same thing, different program. That is also a free downlaod. Anyway, hope that answers yer question... :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yea...I figured it was something to that effect. I would guess that people who's description boxes seem too short for the text, should go in and edit their profiles...problem solved! And...hehehe...I had to laugh when I read about the problem Tethys had about looking at pictures, and accidentally closing the whole site due to some of them being opened in new windows...hahah...I too did the same thing probably a total of 3 times, before I was smart enough to catch on...  ...oooops! Anyway...I just had to laugh about it....

dolphin, if you look at his fucking ip and compare it to the older ones in the ban list you will see they are petty much the same.heres an example 210.215.55.54 or 210.215.55.15all the digits match but the last two at the end, when it shows that its more likley the same person. BTW dolphin it doesn't relly matter how i act, i can do whatever the fuck i want! no matter how childish i may act or pissed i get im just trying to make a mockery of that stupid insolent child! i know he will see it and i kow it will make him mad and i want him to get mad.i'm not trying to impress people will intelectual arguements. most people who do that waste there time thiking thus showing they have no time on there hands. my point was to make him pissed withen a 5 second stand off. I'm not gonna sit there and think of soemthing super intelegent to say when most people will just look and get lost.so shut up!

thanks guys for pointing those problems out seriously.i got to rework the section intirley (for the millionth time) so it will be perfect. i found most of the problems are because of dreamweaver. when i used pagemill i knew the sneaky hings it played but dreamweaver has sneaky things of its own.pagemill was more solid dreamweavers a litle like glass but im supporting dreamweaver because macromedia rocks!i relly wish i knew php, so i could begin a new project "Enigma Complete" it will be made out of php.

I wasn't nitpicking.  It seems to me that if the sound goes by a lot faster than the picture, that would be a major problem that would need to be fixed.  But I did say it was probably just my computer, and obviously it was.  So you can't say that I was nitpicking, especially since it's not a problem for anyone but me. Possibly the problem is that the picture may have been still loading while the sound was done loading.  But I didn't think of that until now.

Thats nice that you've had a fair amount of likeable teachers Tethys D He was good to rally with in tenis though... well.. kill, instead of rally, anyway. Being a former squash player I hit too hard ^^;; &gt;XD Bwahaha. My science teacher - Mrs. Jolley is really nice ) My Pastrol Care teacher, Mr. Moyle (thank the heavens he's not jewish, or else his name would be really embarasing D Whom is kick ass ^^ and you've heard all about that already. Mrs. Welsby... where to start! She is the kindest, most wonderful teacher I have ever had! ^_^ Shes Canadian, and is my Religion teacher, and shes alway caring for us D Oh you can so tell i'm on a high at the moment XD. I've told you people about Miss. Martin.. and I wish I had a few more of my old teachers from grade 7 back... wait... I just wish I was back in primary school with no horrible stairs to climg to get to my English class right after P.E when your legs don't want to work ), but the sad thing is he had diabetes, and the medication he had to take gave him some form of cancer that I can't remember what it was called. He passed away when we where in Year 4 camp. In grade 4 I had Mr. Moore - whom always joked around with me alot D Always mocking us and joking around, and Mrs Skvork was always crafty, so we got to do alot of art in grade 5! Yay! ^-)). Then came grade 6.. where I made a techers life a living hell for that year because she did so to me first. Nobody seemed to like her, and now that our dispute seems to have faded and we're good friends now, people think i'm crazy D People where most miffed 0o;; *sighs* I was teased all my life at the primary school I went to.. it just scared my mind and made me what I am today - somebody whom is a loner and only sticks with her friends and where she feels safe. Wow, a long post 0o;; ahhh, it felt good to let this all out anyway... it's nice to have friends whom I can share this with and not feel like i'm bragging or just talking about me, because I;'m sure that at least one of you have experienced a teacher like one of mine or have been teased in their lifetimes snd can relate to this ^^

Cool, Trel! I like the effects.  Shadow, how do you make layers in photoshop? I never could figure it out.

<div id='container'>
Okay I figured it out, but now I can't figure out how to put something on one layer without it appearing on the other, and is it possible to make layer behind the original image and make a background that way

*shakes her head as she notices an old game of hers*my goodness, i thought i'd never see that old burgertime game ever again... i remember playing that quite a bit when i was younger, never did get very far in it ^_^;even though this is a bizarre mimic of the old game, i still like it! major nostalgia trip there... too bad i still cannot get far in it, did they ever design those games to allow a person to beat them? ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The technique is described is for making a transparent "Overlay" using the opacity slider.If you wanted it as a background, you would place it on the background layer and then paint on a layer thats positioned on top of it in the stack.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*looks at the score given to her by Shadow* hey! i got the best score!... wait... is that a good thing with this? Tethys: indeed, there is a joke reference at the very end of the movie spoofing off of those 'hamster dance' sites, briefly consisting of a singing hamster going down a tube. that part would have to be one of the more interestingly humorous parts of the movie... that, and NG's owner putting his own game, 'samurai asshole', in one of the arcade games in the background.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah its a good thing. It means you can find humor in the face of depravity.The hamster thing makes fun of the "Richard Gere" hamster urban ledgend.Its full of silly little pop culture references that are just too funny.  It was probably one of the first things to really make fun of NAMBLA too, back when nobody knew anything about it really.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Tethys, you see my newest face pic? I did that using layers, what I did was I made the space background, then what I did was, got the original image of THira in this, used the magic wand to select around her and clear the things around her. I pasted her and togled with opacity. ^^ Thats one thing you can do with a finished image, if you want any more help with Photoshop things, PM me, I have alot of good tutorial sites that tell you about layers and the best ways to use them :) Or just ask Shadow XD

Uh, thanks..Hm, well that's pretty much what I have been doing, except I never tried doing anything with opacity but I guess I'm not completely sure what that is.  Anyway I was just wondering if there was a different way to add in a background seperately, but maybe not.  I guess I'm not sure what else I'd use layers for, I just was wondering how to do it cuz I thought it might help somehow.  Well maybe I'll try something with it sometime.  But thanks.

no need to check out other parts of the site, Tethys, the hamster thing is right after the last words sung, then it shows the "play again" link and other features to show that the song is officially over. though, it is a very short scene at the end, i'm not sure if you wish to go through that disturbing song once more just to see a hamster go down a tube into someone's... *cough* ahem... too bad, though... i think that video permanently ruined the q-bert game for me.

</div>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

<br />

<div id='container'>
I know how ya feel Van, Elfwood thinks my pics are too big... why? The hell would I know... Also Elfwood doesn't allow fanfics, so they may take that part out as well. They allow fanart to a minimum though... I like side 7 better, only complained to them once....I never sent anything to ya though Van, I got a similar one too just a few minutes ago. Who the hell sent it?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*glares around* ooohhh...who dunnit?well i was smart and didna put my fanfic up. etain's all me babee. they did take down my sands of time and fin to feather in my art page, which i didnt think they would. i suppose i could create a new gallery at Fanquarter.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well i could accept cuz i LOVE doin trades, but i wouldnt be able to give you your half for some time.
</div>
<br />

Something about sending a notebook of paper to everyone involved in it, and everyone signs the book and sends it to the next person and... so on.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

<div id='container'>
What song?  There was supposed to be a song?  There was no music.  I had my speakers on and I didn't hear anything.  It was just this thing where you click and text appears.  There was no music and no movie.  I must have seen something completely different then what you guys are talking about, but that makes no sense.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Can't argue with that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
8O . Thought I had too much time on MY hands...Nonetheless, I liked the controls, it made it easier to strafe and attack and dodge an array of ammo all at the same time...=)Sadly, never beat the game. That Mizar type' bug at the end always wastes me...;_;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I guess it's too late to offer now.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah...me too...got a virus sent to me...luckily my antivirus program picked up on it, and fixed it. So, it seems like it was definitely someone from here. I got the same thing...an Re from both Arkon and Crestoe...anyway...hopefully it won't cause too much trouble. Oh well, shit happens... :|
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...Tethys, you have to click on the box that says PLAY VIDEO! That circle that looks like a play button only scrolls through the text of Analogy 101...heheh...which is nothing compared to the video! So, if you're so inclined to do so...check it out again, this time click on that button mentioned above, not just the circle play button... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah...no kiddin, huh Trellia! Thank goodness for that! I mean...heck, the link you posted sure wasn't as "gay" as the one Shadow posted...heheh! And, about that Hello Kitty thing...gaw...did we have to bring that up again?! Heheh...man...Shadow, yer friends are a bunch of nuts!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Whoa Delphi yer abit off. First of all we are sending Sketchoox around. mine book aint no notepad. tis a hard cover BOOK. and second, its not just some signing. its a draw in it for about a week, taking 10 to 20 pages (in my book at least) to just draw whatever you want as long as it follows the rules. for more info Trellius go to the Art section and look under "crazy idea for those of you brave enough to humor it" or something like that.Eao Neo will be sending MY book to you and then you will send it to me and my book will be done. you wont receive it for some time tho so dun worry.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i had a dream where the screen was scrolling, thus you can't go back, and if you get caught behind or in frount of a rock, then the screen will smoosh you (like in The Machine) and I was ecco, and I got smoshed in a 3D level that moved.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
dumbass whats else?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh my goal is to get some of these sections some more attention. when i had my contacts page the only people who submitted profiles was you fargal and vantid and after that the contacts went to dust.but i proved i can revive it by combining it in the fanfare. so im glad i got something that was horrible and crappy and turned it into something big and great!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
what will we do?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
passages from genesis looked sorta lik the asterites cave it even had a pathway that seemed like it would lead to the area but i could just be imagining things.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it came from eithier d-12 or psysonic. both are known for sending me email viruses.anyhow when i got the virus it spread. the way to get rid of it is to go into your "win" folder and into "system32" and delete "kernel32.exe"then the virus will be gone.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
doom im pretty sure that was in the old forum.
</div>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Its a PIF worm, so you don't need to open it to be infected. And yes, if you use outlook its already been passed on to your entire addressbook.Grab a copy of the Cleaner//www.moosoft.com/download.phpThat should take care of all the known variant of PIF. Looks like this versin is packed with some sort of trojan type deal.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Del Del?  Can I call ya Del Del?  Or how about the Delphmeister?

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Haha man someones gonna steal that and sell the drawing under their own name!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Man see corvoire is so cool he signed my guestbook!  Speaking of come to xtremecco where you can see the secret ecco cereal and take free taste tests!  Well thats probably a joke that only arkon understands but hey....Come on to xtremecco and try to recreate the moments of your life back when we had clear pepsi and side scrolling games!  Becauase quite frankly, DOTF wasn't all that good.Well anyway corvoire we don't have any National lampoon's animal house style initiations, but goddamn if you arent the coolest person to come here in a long time!  I swear man i was losing hope with all these retarded kids running around!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Werll holy fucking crap would you look at that.  My old undercaves profle and my godawful old artwork.  I have a problem with thinking that my current artwork is the fucking bomb and it skews my perspective....  I'll scan some new artwork in later today probably.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ha d12 the friend of many?  That kid is such a nerd!   He should give himself a wedgie just to save everyone some time, that damn tryhard.  Jeez the kid wanted to know some stupid crap and all blah blah blah.  I swear that kid gives Down's Syndrome a bad name.  If i had some money i would use it to find his identity, go to new zengland, and beat the shit out of him.  I might swing past California to pick up some friends too.  You know, the more the merrier!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well eao for once you have an idea i agree with.  I wante dot do that myself, with me being the history lizard and all   Maybe arkon still has the old undercaves forum laying around, and i know the old arkonviox.com forum is around soemwhere too.Man i was so stupid back then!  And more people liked me too, go figure.Support this idea people, i mean if you thought an ecco cookbook was cool this is the cure for cancer.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah mookys the obligatory guy who doesnt draw attention to himself but hes still cooler than the rest of us.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah probably whitefin =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yer imagining things maybe they were talking about how some 3d levels are based offa oldschool ecco levels.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Damn!   I was so close to calling someone Doo Doo   :P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Mommy told me that people aren't retarded, they're SPECIAL.  Yah, I was kinda dissapointed about the lack of initiation thing.  But I know if there's one person on this earth that can figure out how to give an online paddeling... it's Arkon.  ::::  "Who's your Daddy?"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What kind of initiation do you want? maybe thats why new people sit around there posts and die, cause im not doing this initiation thing.Heh ecco cerial, i picture it tasting like captian crunch...mmmmmm captain crunch...wahhaaaaaahaa
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well hist for starters your artwork isnt even ecco related but since your an old dinisaur on my site and since i like your art i'll take it in.but anyone else who doesnt submit art related to the crit-you know the dman word will get there testicles chopped off!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i love this idea eao! i have the intire undercaves forum intact too as well as everyone things.We can work on the intire time line from when it all began now but i will need some help!God eao thats very brilliant.and hist layoff the cookbooke the cookbooks gonna pick up you'll see. Nothing on my website will do shitty. this isnt psysonics site!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I don't know about Doomy, but I've been calling you Doom.And dolphingirl is DG, not Dol.I think Shadow is about the only one who hasn't had anyone shorten his name.  But, I mean, how could you shorten it without it sounding stupid?Uh, yeah, I was just referring to the fact that just about everyone here has had their name shortened.  People don't call me Teth very often, but I have been called that a few times.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeh, I've been playing too many rpg games, I got the idea I think partly from playing Saga Frointeir 2, and it's oddness and historical  teaching.Man, I got to go to my shrink soon....and 'finish' the comic, Ark, you may not have huge blue fins..or 'wings' what ever they were called.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
man speaking of psysonics site i wonder if he is making a history of ecco too.  Excpet he'll probably make it so he wins.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ecco cereal now theres a kick ass idea
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I didn't even see that button before.Well....um....Of course I was curious....I have nothing more to say.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay, that was weird.  The only problem is I couldn't read most of it because it went by too fast.What does "yatta" mean, anyway? That is, if it means anything at all.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Guess I need some work on my nicknames!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh heh... oh the evil and twisted ideas I have for initiation!  If only there were away to do it online...............   Ecco cereal... just add tuna and milk!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay that was messed up.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Who cares what it means?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the race is on!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
o.o sounds like something asteritus would say.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
...Nope, can't think of a single witty remark.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That was my e-mail... &gt;;( This is getting damn annoying y'know?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Plushy-Wushy is pretty cute, but I think this site's humor level would aprove of Tighty-Whitey first   humor level? indeed.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Don't worry 'bout it.  Even the best of us get a brain-fart every now and then.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
LOL, yes Van' it was worth it...taaabbbllleeetttt....*drool*  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah, yatta has no meaning, its just some crazy word in japaneese... heh ^^;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Being the fox Van, and in the tale the fox eats the chickens or goes to, so I just hope you don't hate me when i trace my pre-limernary pic.you and Ark are hard to draw, too detailed....

Lol, like the confederats.whenever i see somone with a 'fed flag licence plate I feel like yelling out "get over it!  You LOST the war...it's over!"

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
who is cindy
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
that's basically the point of animutations in general. they take disturbing japanese/other foreign songs and place them with even more disturbing flash movies, quite entertaining in my opinion! especially when they put down subtitled lyrics for english-sounding words, which make things especially random ^_^ i shall give the next example...http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/content.php?id=45257this one is titled after what the lyrics sound like in english, "We Drink Ritalin"... if i hadn't known this was an animutation, and the fact that it made very little sense anyway, i would have thought that this was sung in just very bad english. thankfully it is not, but i still like it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
who is cindyThat would be me, why?  Where did you see that name?And who is this anonymous person?

Nah...don't worry about it corvoire...most people just use it for the sake of having to type out the whole name. Or, for those who they can't say too well in their head while typing it...I dunno...some nicks just get shortened...while others don't. You'll catch on...heh!

Yea...sounds like a good idea Eao... :D ...though, I could see things getting a bit sticky what with all the crap that went on since way back when...but it would be nice to stroll down memory lane and remember what happened.

But, I s'pose I could've prevented some of those sleepless nights if I weren't such a terrible procrastinator...heheh!

Finally got around to getting a few rolls of slides developed, etc so on, so forth.Anyway, without further delay//www.dolphinparadise.net/photos/I'll eventually get this integrated with my current sitecode I'm building, so for right now its basically a glorified photoshop "Web Photo Album" or whatever that little automator that comes with PS6 is called.I'm kinda annoyed because the local photo places around here don't carry slide film over ISO 200.  Poor lighting,  glare, poor stability and moving subject all push the limit of 200 film's shutter speed. Much easier to deal with 400, and be slightly undershot, rather than be on cue and be unsharp, since its much easier to fix underexpose than it is to fix an edge mask.   :(

What does "yatta" mean, anyway? That is, if it means anything at all."Yatta" is the name of the naked japanese boyband of which this thing mocks.

I don't really know much about viruses, but I'm pretty sure that it can't do anything if you don't open the attachment.  It's possible that if you open the e-mail it might send itself out to other people, but I really don't know.  But I can't see how it can possibly hurt anything if you don't download it, because unless you do it's not actually on your harddrive.I wonder what would happen if you downloaded it onto a floppy disk instead..?  That is, if it could fit on a disk..

Not quite Tethys. Email clients like outlook (and anything else that uses the IE object for html display) is vulnerable to scripting exploits, to the point where you just have to recive the message to be exploited.Sucks, but thats how it is. Update your system or use something other than outlook for mail handling.

Oh. Well, like I said, I don't know much about viruses.  But I think AOL is pretty safe, but I'm not sure.  At least Norton was able to detect it.I only got a virus in my e-mail one other time.  It only affected AOL, and it sent itself to everyone on your buddy list and made it look like it was from you.  I can't remember exactly what it did.  Unlike this one, it was always the same file, and it said something to the effect of "here are my pictures" or something like that.  I didn't suspect anything because it appeared to be from someone I knew and I had never gotten a virus before, I didn't know that they could work like that. So I downloaded it, and then I couldn't open it, of course.  So I tried to delete it and it said I didn't have access.  I think we got rid of it using Norton.  I know it only affected AOL, which is why it only sent itself to AOL members, but I can't remember what it did.  I think it made it so AOL couldn't open or so you couldn't log in or something. That was several years ago.

<div id='container'>
uh yeah tethys =) without you i'd be pretty bored...heh without you...heh...heres something rediculous, i got some new profiles in my email today and one was by a guy named blackfin...i guess its  new blackfin...heh i thought people knew territory when they saw it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the pioint of why i brought those up was because in them you can see what a fucking sissy fag psysonic was.he made a big deal when i took over the site and just talked shit the whole way. and he acted like he broke up with blackfin like they were boyfriend and boyfriend or whatever they call it. oh yes partners o.o;;;i relly hated how people treated me when i owned the undercaves. i wanted to keep the site going then people just mocked me and shunned me. i got nasty emails, nasty posts in my guestbook by psysonic and it relly hurt me.im not a perfect person but i do care for people. but psysonic and his band of lackeys i didnt care for. i hated them with a passion ever since i was forced off the internet in jan 1, 2001 i thought about it everyday. i had no internet i watched arkonviox.com die. people left and when i mentioned i was coming back people just seemed bored of hearing it. then people didnt treat me the same.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
just to finish my story when i came back i swore id get revenge and do soemthing. i don't know why i was so mad. maybe because blackfin accomplsihed soemthing i wanted to accoplish first. i waned sucess. i wanted a good website but blackfin seemed to dominate it all.i feel abd for how i drove blackfin away. but you know, he wasnt the most stable person on earth. hes probably proud that he doesnt have to do a website anymore. a website is like a curse, when you own it and it gets good you want to leave but you dont want the community to die so you pass it on. when that happens the curse continues and spreads itself.a community is controled by there leader. a good website comes from a good leader. you got to know what people want and most of all show them that you care.i won the undercaves community because i relly tried to make friends with everyone.i hate talking about this because im sure people are sick of it. making a timeline brings back alot of anger, and rilvalrys but this is what we are.funny huh? just a stupid website? what if we were club? lived all locally and worked together for some purpose we dont relly know. i guess clubs the way to explain it. we created a society, club, whatever you want to call it but it comes down to community in a virtual world that brings us together. fights happen and much more and eras die and legends die we wait again then new legends come and old legends die.but you know soemthing i may have made alot of mistakes but if i were to do it again. i wouldnt change a thing. i wanted Arkonviox.com to be the best website on ecco ever and dammit i fucking did it!people will say i used blackfins work but relly did i? what of blackfins do you se ehere besides a walkthrough and a few fossiled remains hes left? i designed this website i put together every section and everything here consists of what fans wanted on it and what fans wanted out of it.this sites only here because i didnt want the udnercaves community to die and i wanted to bring popularity to the ecco community and show other websites were somebody too.

A big thanks to Trellia for letting me use her sprites to make these... check out the new Arkonviox.com Sprites!!!I tried to make one for everyone, but I'm very sorry if I didn't! I probably just don't know what your character looks like, so you can notify me with some info if you want one.I thought it would be a neat new addition to the site, or something. I'm going to try and make some comics (like TMS) with them, and you can give it a shot too.I don't know if this is even a good idea, but if we want, I could make more I guess. I thought it would be a neat idea.So here you go! Check them out!http There was supposed to be another option in the poll: "These are gay! What were you thinking?" You can vote that too. ^^

Yeah dude arkon you're right.  And countless times i've wished this was a real club as to make it easier for yours truly to reorganize some people's faces.  Psysonic and his band of tonail fuckers are straight out of the blundercaves, seriously.  Holy shit they're run by a german kid named Hauke who listens to German techno and makes posts with music from Sonic Adventure in it to mourn people leaving.  And all I have to say about that is this:HOLY SHIT!   I find it so fucking hard to believe that any country that produced Psysonic came very close to conquering most of the world just 60 years ago.  Seriously, think about it.  I'm sorry but anyone who can utilize and Arkonviox like attitude to the real world has to be a huge fucking badass.  But then again, psysonic is probably a minority, i mean he doesn't even like Ramstein.  And you know, cool German people LOVE their Ramstein.Please don't ignore the above paragraph like you guys do to everything i write.  It is the best point i've made in my whole life.And if it counts, i'd just like to say i'm positive i wrote something along the lines of "Leave it to psysonic to use video game music to honor a real person" or soemthing like that.  If not im sure i thought it.  What a fucking fag.

Ok... so I made all those sprites, and the idea was comics like those That's My Sonic things. A new section for Arkonviox.com. Whoo-who! Comix, yes!Well here was my idea//www.geocities.com/ark_comix/Arkonviox.Comix (thank Delphi for the clever name.)So what do you all think? Let me know if this is a bad idea and I'm taking it to far.  But if it is a good idea, let me know too and maybe we can get this going.It's a sneek preview! Cool!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
No, but really... why is there no channel one. I'm not kidding, it's crazy!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Those are awesome!    I love mine! ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lookin good! *can see hilarious outcomes with theese things* XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Channel One... oh that brings back memories.... my gawd my life was a waste.    
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sorry, I was a bit hyper.  But not as much as I am now from all this Easter candy...Be Afraid!!   I warn you!Erm....sorry....x.o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow, of all the times we've gotten off topic...this is about the worst of it!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What was the topic again?   
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
X.@;;;;I was just joking!That was from the Eao-Little comic.You guys are sick.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm not sick... I'm special!    
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aw, did your mommy tell you that?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
....yeah....so?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm not sure anyone said anything about listening to the music when they're not playing the game.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I remember alligators (could have been crocodiles) and, I think maybe sharks...or something.  That's about all I can really remember, besides the tanks. I don't remember if we saw dolphins or whales, but I would imagine so.  The images in my memory are very blurry and hazy.  That musta been a REALLY long time ago. I wonder how old I was...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds cool to me!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmm, I just had a thought.. Sten you probably know Kim, Sharkane, Valentin, Freya and Wiki(Kian).
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm new. No, my name is not Ecco derived, but I am one of the game series' biggest fans. I think it is the single most underrated game ever. It has gorgeous gameplay and enthralling music, yet people keep calling it the most boring game ever. Not true! IMO the most boring game ever created is Mortal Kombat.Well, anyway. Just want to say Hi.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I rely on my lovely Paint Shop Pro.Paint Shop Pro? Kewlness, me too...  What version do you have? I have version 6. :D

<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes... :D ...welcome!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Seems like a good idea... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheheh...Histronic's right! Anyway, great job on yer comic there Eao... :D ...I too loved your humor in it...nice work! Can't wait to see more!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Precisely what I meant when I said before..."I could see things getting a bit sticky what with all the crap that went on since way back when"...my goodness...it's weird reading all that old stuff. I liked that midi that's playing in that one...heheh...it's cool. Yea yea, it may be cheesy...but it's a cool song... ;) ...anyway, despite what bad things it brings up...I still think it's a good idea...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hahahah...  ...I'm sorry, but some of those sayings/jokes up there were frickin funny!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Those are awesome Doomtrain... ? ...what's the deal with that?

<div id='container'>
hehe, these are awsome  Doomsta..... keep up the good... O-o ... no... Awsome work.

Greetings Aquilae.You're quite right when you refer to MK as boring. Most spazzeroid games are. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ha ha ha ha dolphingirl you hella freaked me out. i was like "awe man shit! i already got a big project going if i have to watch for updates on a seqeual i'd go nuts!"heh that was pretty good ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it sure does bring up alot of crap. the ecco community has had a fucked up past much like i did. ha ha hastupid unforgiving past!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh frieccos sprite cracks me up. its good but if i ever seen that swimming in the ocean ha ha ha id feel sorry for it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
thats a brilliant idea. problem is i already got a comics section.but i could put it in the comics with the sprites sheet and work out something which we could do what your proposing.gimme a few days off though heh im at my bros until wednesday cause were working out a big plan for the website. a big plan =)i'll let you know when i get the stuff ready for it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh i agree with you Aquilae, ecco is the most underated but my goal is to change that if i ever get project arkon back in gear. it seems to be rusting in the old barn crying for me to do soemthing with it.anyhow welcome to the site! if i could give you a little advice on how we can show them other websites that ecco the dolphin is the best damned game out there then stick around here, and don't leave =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh those are pretty good. i have to go to marine world to see dolphins but i can see you got to see them a little more upclose.don't get me wrong i may be a little bored with ecco but dolphins have always been my favorite animal
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i use my good old boot leg of photoshop 6!*kisses the illegal copy and runs from a nearby police siren*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
man what has become of the sonic community. seems like there getting bored with themselves or its just become lame or soemthing.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Grotty minds?!?!?  I resemble that remark!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^_^ Thanks guys! Glad to be here too. Hopfully I can help out somehow. Thanks for the greetings!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^_^ I'm glad you guys like the idea! And thanks Whitefin... I'll have to stick that in! ^^ Do you want a soinc plussie, or a Knuckles plussie?And that'll be cool if we can work something out Arkon. I'm in no hurry, so you can get all yer site stuff done first of course.Ok, I made my first sprite comic. This was kind of a test, I guess. Check it out//www.geocities.com/ark_comix/ep01.jpg As you can see, it's practically a total rip off of That's My Sonic... but hey! That was the idea in the first place! ^^Anyways. I'll have to make more sprites. And hopfully other people will make some sprites and comix too. We'll see how it goes.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yay!   I'm glad you all like them! Looks like I'll be making more! Well the good thing about yours Dolphingirl, is it's easy to make, so you and Al will probably have the most! ^_^Ah, Whitefin, you figured me out huh? Well, I bet you can't guess what Yogoat's was. ^^ Heh heh.I'll try and make more. And a new one for Hist, because it looks like a dog. O_o That's cause it was a dog!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Go here//home.camelot.de/danielt/whatswrong.htmlAnd tell me what's wrong with that picture. It's NOT the curtains, as the site says. Take a good long look at it, you'll see it. It's just tricky to find, and it's pretty funny when you do!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Aquilae! Welcome to the board! I'm sure you'll fit right in... as long as your weird O_o If not, you may feel out of place. ^_^ Nah, j/k!Welcome anywho!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh god! I here about it once from a friend, and it starts poping up everywhere! Isn't it wierd how things happen like that?Heh heh. Cool anyways! You forgot to tell everyone to turn up there speakers or it's no fun!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A little knuckles one XD Heh, she can sick the plushie on them 0o;;; :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Doomtrain! Shush! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That was pretty cool.What's Jub Jub? That little mushroom guy?Oh, the link doesn't work, of course, you have to copy and paste it.You know, I've never seen or even heard of "That's My Sonic."  Could someone spare a link?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That reminds me of Foghorn Leghorn on Space Jam.  "Chicken?  Ah say, Ah say, Ah resemble that remark!"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
LOL!Too bad I already read Friecco's comment before clicking that link, but it's still not quite what I expected.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I resent that.  Mortal Kombat was one of the few games I was actually good at, and I liked it.  MKG was very dissappointing, however.But I do agree Ecco is most underrated.  I can't see how anybody can play an Ecco game and not like it.  And they're challanging, I never actually beat any of those games (besides Ecco Jr., of course), not without cheating.Anyway, welcome to the board, and I hope you stay.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It seems like everyone has Photoshop 6 now.  I have 5.5.  My mom got it off e-bay at a much cheaper price than you can buy it for at a store (it's really expensive).  It's a copy, but it's a legal copy.  Don't ask me how.  In any case, I think it will be a long time before we get a better versian, if ever, because it's so damn expensive.

I can't see it.  First it was taking forever to load and then I got an illegal operation message and AOL closed.  Then, twice it timed out, and the other two times I got a message that it wasn't responding.  I guess I'll just have to try again tomarrow.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've beaten Ecco and Tides of Time twice each.  But in Defender of the Future, the "use a giant to scare a giant" puzzle had me so stumped I had to look up the solution in a walkthrough. Does that count as cheating? I liked Defender of the Future, but my favorite is probably still Tides of Time, with the original in close second. The music in DoF disappointed me. It was nowhere near as majestic as it was in Tides. I need to go back and play all those old games again. It's been ages.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...cool!Speakin of the pic Histronic...did ya make sure the box is NOT checked for "Disable BBCode in this post"...when posting a message? Perhaps that's why the code tag wouldn't work...?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I dunno about the "count as cheating thing"...but yea...heheh...I would hardly describe a turtle and a stingray as "giants".....hahhaha... 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I myself have been to seaworld.... in NZ. Several times, only.... they don't have dolphins or Orcas in it    . BUT..... We do have like, Pinguins, Stingrays, Moray Eels,some Nurse Sharks as well as Tiger Sharks. :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
And tell me what's wrong with that picture. It's NOT the curtains, as the site says. Take a good long look at it, you'll see it. It's just tricky to find, and it's pretty funny when you do!Uh... DELPH... Thanks for giving me a scare of my life (Ya almost gave me a heart attack). 8O

It would be nice if there was a new section devoted entirely to FLASH Movies (like the Insanity Test one....)it might work the best like:1. "Forum" section. (section for Arkonviox.com PPL, to post  flash movies they find interesting.2. there could be voting poll (which flash is the best)

<br />

<div id='container'>
as much as that would sound good i can't go and take others copyied right material and put it up. plus id be getting a little off subject of the site - being an ecco website. i mean the hall of shames a little off subject especially nowadays but thats the only section i want to be off subject.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i'm pretty sure thats what happened to him
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i'd call it cheating but, then againm i cheated for "the hatchery level" i couldnt find those damned buttons, they looked like they were apart of the wall!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
my favorite music out of songs of time cd was the machine. then out of the genesis game it be homebay theme and trellias bay theme.i had alot of favorites out of the genesis though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i had photoshop 5 limited but your not missing much in 6.0 i mean it has alot of new stuff but having photoshop let alone is a big thing!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i seen that one before. it freaked me out damn you@
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Me?  Crazy?  No....    
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah i told you these bbcodes are to compicated! -_-  Oh well thanks for posting it shadow i personally think it kicks ass.  It has eight frames duder!   Here's a new ten frame one which is really gangstah//jwalk.vortx.net/features/animatedgifs/turtleswim.gifHaha that damn disable bbcode box.  Oh by the way, as i make these, i realize that -more- work seems to have been put into the minor characters.  Trellia and Ecco only have four or five frames if i remember correctly, the shark has eight, and the turtle you only see once has ten!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Man and there i was trying to get a beta for it.... of well.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Man this post is a lock waiting to happen.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Not to mention it would turn into a mess after awhile....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well Tethys when people talk about midis and sega powercuts and alternate versions its pretty reasonable to assume they're talking about when theyre not playing the game
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well i liked ecco a lot, especially the genesis ones, but i can see how some people wouldn't like it.  I always figured it would have been better if there was more fighting, because quite frankly, it was quite the action/rpg hybrid.  It wasn't a puzzler like DOTF, not really.  So what the result was was a game that couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be.  But with sonar powerups and destructable background bla blah it would have been -damned- special.And mortal kombat was not a boring game, i mean spazzing out is fun, especially when you can share it with friends.  Its just when those motherfucker friends of mine start blocking too much is when i have to make the violence go from virtual to real.  -_-  I mean it has to be done.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Man arkon where have you been it became lame ever since i left it.  If it wasnt i woulda stayed there, heh.  But then i would be a fag now wouldnt I?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
not yet, im waiting to get whitefins, thus we can balance everything...if i should send mine out now tho, tell me
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol. As long as you aren't refering to games like Gradius and Gunstar Heroes, I'll agree...you should know how much I love shmups by now! =)Oh, welcome aboard you! Don't worry, most of our names aren't ecco related in the least.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm surprised you let it go this long.

<br />

<div id='container'>
BAD DOL!!!  BAD DOL!!!

<div id='container'>
Well since this topic started so long ago, I forgot that anybody said anything about that.In any case, Hist, I don't see what's wrong with enjoying game music.  You seem to be in the minority of opinion.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
When I said I cheated, I meant I used the level select code with the invincibility and the option that lets you use that one sonar attack all the time.  But even then it was hard--I beat the queen the first time around, with the code as I said, but after that I couldn't do it again and just gave up.  After the first time, I couldn't keep from getting swallowed all the time and having to start over. I didn't know the stage select code for Ecco 1.  I got it now, from this site, but I have to actually have a chance to play the game--my Genesis is at our cottage, and we go there weekends during the summer, and even then I almost never play the stupid thing and besides that it doesn't work very well.As for DoF, I've mentioned before that I've barely played it at all and in fact never got past I think the second level.  I couldn't beat that shark, and now that I know how to beat it, I haven't gotten around to playing the game again in a long time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well said Tethys.  This topic is too inane and over with to even be split.(LOCKED)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Here, at least.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
OMG! I am still shaking.  I practically fell out of my chair.DoomTrain, why did you have to say to turn the speakers up?  I turned on my speakers and when I heard nothing, because of what you said, I turned them up really high thinking that perhaps there was some very soft noise that could only be heard if the volume was really high.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's what I meant to say...I was gonna say "You seem to be in the minority of opinion here," but I forgot to type the word "here."
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
LOL! Ha ha! Sorry bout' that Tethys! That must have been a real shock! Ha, well I guess it'll be something to laugh at later. Poor Teth... ^_^ Now you can do it to all of your friends though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It gave me a heart attack too, Fri and Teth... it didn't help that I'd been playing Resident Evil all morning and was home alone when I watched it, either. I screamed loud enough to scare my dog, who was downstairs at the time  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I like game music, personally. I mean, what's different between it and just listening to instrumental *makes quotes sign above her head* NORMAL music? I see no difference.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tsk tsk. I'm late again. Oh well, that was a good one, anyway.  8O

<div id='container'>
Shoot em ups rock.  I play them all the time.  The Guardian Legend is still the greatest shmup of all time.I don't think Ecco games need TOO much fighting.  It needs some, but not a lot of it.  Ecco games aren't action games, they're experience games. And dolphins aren't known for fighting.  They're known for their brains.To beat the Queen.  Take out both her eyes with your sonar.  Charge the lower jaw and pump away like mad when she sucks.  Don't use the charge when she sucks.  It's asking for trouble.  Boy this brings back memories.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh well...huh Friecco... :( ...I'm sure it sounded like a good idea at the time.....eh!? Hehe... ;)

<div id='container'>

<div id='container'>
Heheh...poor Hist...can't get those frickin codes to work eh?! Well, I don't know why it's giving you so much trouble... :| ...but hopefully you can figure it out sooner or later! Er wait...as I'm getting ready to submit this response...is it just that the link is broken...?...aww heck...nevermind...heh!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I agree with you Delphi... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hahahah...poor Tethys...sounds along the lines of what happened to me when I saw it for the first time. My brother had emailed it to me, saying...make sure you're volume is on as it'll give you clues to what's wrong...luckily, I didn't turn it way up like you did Tethys...heheh...but it still gave me the scare of my life! To make matters worse...I was eating a popsicle...I shook so bad it nearly ended up on the keyboard!?! Hehehe...man that's a good "scare"... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm going to try turning the sound effects off then and play through Roaring Forces again. Then I can slap the Atlantis music onto Minidisc. Woohoo!I'm currently on Lair Of Evil, got stuck on the bit with the vine wrapped round the propeller but according to the guide there's a button somewhere so I should be able to crack on with it!YAY!  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I agree too - I've played my Final Fantasy VII soundtrack CD's to death. I love game music, it's superb. DotF has SO MUCH good music, wow... I love the Atlantis music, plus Caverns of Hope and Anguish from Dearth. In general though it's all brilliant.  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome to the forum! I'm pretty new myself. And people who've played DotF will know that my name is from there! :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The Dolphin's Nightmare world is superb. I kind of agree about David Brin messing it up a bit, at first I was utterly baffled by the plot. Now I understand it but it's still kind of... weird... and I miss the more 'normal' levels of the original Ecco - ie. they were played in real-world settings. But still, DotF is a great game. The PS2 version is definitely an improvement over the DC version. There are better clues for solving puzzles; the graphics are jazzed up a bit although there is a bit of brek-up and pop-up which wasn't present on the DC; the controls are also a bit easier and manageable.I don't think the conversion was rushed in the slightest - it's release date here in the UK slipped several times and it ended up being released about 4 months late. Sony and co. definitely took their time over it and I like the added extras in the gallery - the fact you can play the music without the water sound effects is just brilliant.  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I heard recently that the original Ecco the Dolphin is to be released quite soon for GBA, along with two other Sega games, Gauntlet Legends and Sonic Spinball, all on one cartridge, which will be called Sega Smash Pack. Anyone got any more info on this???
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
As you can see, I just got a screenshot from DotF and cropped it, and the result is pretty cool I reckon... :) (Nothing like the actual Prime Mover from DotF but never mind!!!)
</div>

<div id='container'>
With reference to the topic title, what is it with people using the word 'gay' to describe something which irritates them or they don't like? It's not big and it's not clever, it's just offensive and unnecessary. I hear kids using it all the time now, and it really pi$$es me off.In references to viruses, thankfully I've never been the recipient of one, although I guess it's only a matter of time...!

Nobuo Uematsu is a friggin' musical genius, if you ask me. I'm not much of a fan of the Final Fantasy games, but I love their soundtracks, especially 8's. So are Masami Ueda (composer of the music from the Resident Evil games) and whoever it was that composed the music from Skies of Arcadia.

<br />

<div id='container'>
*laughs*This sounds crazy!

<div id='container'>
Ok... so what do you think I should do now? Should I tell everyone about it and see if people can start making some comics. I've made three as of now, and being not a very funny person, they really blow... so maybe we can get some funny one's going. I've also made a bunch more sprites to use. Backgrounds too.There really fun to make! I just don't have the jokes to make em' with. So help me out here. Post it in the general board?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ah Prime gay is just a word that can be used in many different contexts...it's not offensive, unless maybe you are homosexual, it's just a word. Like straight (also another form of sexuality) can be used to describe things that are straight. Or fuck even can mean many different things. You shouldn't get so upset over words, they only hurt if you let them.Even if someone who is gay is offended by the word, why should they be? Unless it is used in a discriminating fashion, it's harmless. Besides people these days have such a small vocabulary that using small unintellegent words are all they can manage from their struggling intellects...Crimes of discrimination speak way louder than words.

well that's odd... i recall seeing that turtle up yesterday, it was a very nice 10 frame sprite. i'm not sure what is going on with it now, it comes up as a broken link, then when i click on 'show picture' nothing happens...anyways, wonderful sprites there, Doomtrain! all of them look amazing, i especially love how you got all of the patterns of my char down on such a tiny dolphin ^_^ i'm definitely holding on to my new little neo' sprites
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thos are made by Psycho?  Man, I haven't visited his site in years.  Not ever since I figured out that he's a giant ass.  But these are actually kind of funny, at least the ones I've read so far.  Thanks for the link, DT.Anyway, I'd love to help out, but I'm as stuck on ideas as you are.  I'm not good at coming up with funny stuff like that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh heh... glad you like em Vantid. You do look like your doing something from an RPG, cause... well you are! You're Shive from FFVI... but shhhhh. ^^ I supposed I could give a shot at those cool butterfly dolphins. Got a pic? Send it over and I'll give it a try!Speaking of... has Neo finished her pic of those dolphin's yet? It's really cool and I still want to see it! If you're reading this Neo!And Eao... if you send me some pictures of your character(s)... I could do them too! If you have any pic's that is. ^^

Some people that have AOL also have AIM as well.  I don't see the point in that.  I don't need AIM or Y!M or ICQ or any of that, I can still talk to people who have AIM,  and I don't know anybody that has those other things who doesn't also have AOL or AIM.  I did have AIM for a short time, because some friends persuaded me to get it, but I never used it, mainly because I had no reason to use it, so I uninstalled it.

<div id='container'>
I agree, the guy is an ass. I've talked to him, and it's writen all over his site. He really is a jerk... but a funny one none the less.When you speak of him, you sound like you actually know him... is that true? Do you really know the guy?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^_^ Glad you like em' Neo. You're and Swifty's were fun to make. I'm actually having some fun making more! I hope I can have a whole collection soon. *evil grin* Voodoo sprites!Anyways... Eao, you said page error? Try again, it should be working fine.

<div id='container'>
i saw them by a differnt link.hmmm as a fin my 'star' if pinkish..or with photoshop just plop a lens flare...if you do an cartoonish eoraptor, good luck, the gothic-like eye markings and the comet streak are a pain.unless you want to make an enlongated eao phin, with the blue and the eye markings.

Yes! Final Fantasy music! Whoo-who! I love FFVIII's sound track... just wish I could get a hold of it. But if you ask me... Guilty Gear has the most ass-kicking sound track!

<br />

<div id='container'>
I agree, the guy is an ass. I've talked to him, and it's writen all over his site. He really is a jerk... but a funny one none the less.When you speak of him, you sound like you actually know him... is that true? Do you really know the guy?No, I don't really know him.  I did two art trades with him, and I talked to him a little bit, I wanted to try to get to know him because at first I thought he was cool.  He was the first artist that I did a trade with, and, in fact, the first artist who I asked to draw any of my characters.  I liked his older style better.  For the second trade, I drew two pictures, one of his character's old look, because I liked it better, and one of his new look.  I had to send them seperatly because my computer was being stupid.  I wanted him to draw my character, Tiarra, in what was her latest appearance at the time.  He just looked at the first drawing I sent and says something to the effect of "Why should I draw your new look if you won't draw mine?"  Then later on after he looked at the second picture he says "That's more like it," and he ended up drawing Tiarra in her then-new look anyway.  Later on I drew this picture of his character just for the heck of it, I worked really hard on it and I was quite proud of how it turned out.  And all he has to say is it's "pretty good."  And, I don't remember what I said in reply or what he said after that, but I do remember that he was a big jerk about it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You can do one of Amphitrite if you want, you could probably use that seahorse.  I think the topic I posted with the link to her pic is still in the art forum.I'm also working on a picture of another character, who has no name yet.  He might be hard to do, but if you can do sprites of Arkon and Crestoe you can do one of this guy.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah... cocky bastard. He wanted me to put him in my links, and I said "sure! You wanna affiliate... that's cool!" ... "No... I just want you to link me." Pfft... screw that.I was reading all the comments he made about his fanart and stuff too... It actually pissed me off. There's a difference between constructive criticism and bashing someone elses best done work. I'd tell him to take my art down if he said some of that stuff about mine. ... In the words of Jader, "Ya ASS!" and "Shut up! No one ASked you!"Well... anyways... he can just stay at his site and be an ASS! As for here... I'm going to go post about the comics in the general board now.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds good to me! ^_-Oh and... someone in charge can un-announcify this post. I've let the cat out of the bag about the comix place. Thanks!

<div id='container'>
What good are sprites if your not going to do anything with them, right? So here we go... Arkonviox.Comix! A new little thing for sprite comics of Arkonviox.com. Forgive the total rip off of the "That's My Sonic" comics, I'm not a very original person. But hey... that was the main idea in the first place, right?!httproll:

(laughs) "In the words of Jader..." (laughs more)Yeah, this PsyGuy sounds like a real asshole. Well, doesn't matter. I can read his comics and laugh at them, but I don't actually have to talk to him, right? Yep, sounds good to me  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
There was a day when he used to not be a huge asshole. I used to know him really well, as I used to always go to the chat her run , PSC - and roleplay with him and such. But I really don't seem to know him any more -.-;;Pfft! LOL!! 'I still love you' *huggles the plushie* :D

Someone who wanted to be all cool with Psy I guess. Maybe one of his buddies did, like Ritz of Squeaks. I did ask to use some of their sprites so I could make some "Ecco" comics. Perhaps one took it upon themselves to find these sprites? I dunno.You should just fix them to say what you want, then send them back into him.  :? Maybe that will fix it up.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ha ha! Whoo-who! I love them! This is what we want... lot's of people making comix! I like the one with Knukles drowning. Heh heh. Poor Sonic characters.Do you want me to put them up on the site? Cause I'd love to have them!Two pannel goodess. That's all we need. If everyone made one shorty we'd have lots!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think your Windows XP could be the problem for that. It isn't compatible with much old stuff (such as my PhotoShop 5! Argh!). So that could be why for that.Keep in mine I'm NO expert though.I'm not sure about your laptop though. I would think it would work there. Hmmmm.... SHADOW! Help us! &lt;-- He's the computer buff around here. ^_^

Hey everyone!!!! I finally got my hands on PhotoShop! Thanks to my bestest, bestest friend Delphi! Weee! I love you, I love you!!!Ahem... but yeah! PhotoShop 6.0!! I feel so special! ^_^ The only problem is, I've never used it before and my little mind finds the all the magnificent tools very complicating.Does anyone have any starting tips or good tutorials for me? I could use em'! I already know of the PolyKarbon tutorials... but any others? Pointer's anyone? ... Please? ...Maybe soon I can become an amazing colorer like Jo Chen and Julie Dilon! *sign* I can only hope. ^_^ Thanks!

It covers Photoshop for Beginners all the way through to advanced, giving lessons for each level *IE-learning the 'Menu Bar', the 'Layers Palette', etc*)Anyway, that's what I got.

I was the one that bought it up, if you want more info, go to Arkon's News board.  It's not out yet, I have a secret site that I go to in order to find my GBA roms. Hence the reason I've been playing Sonic Advance since Christas last year &gt;:D

Haha, he totally reminds me of myself!

<div id='container'>
Haha! I LOVE Kirby! Those are cute, Trell. I'm having a bit of trouble making my own, though, because when I put the sprites of the dolphins on the background there's a white box around them. Anyone able to help me here? How do you make 'em transparent? Aren't they supposed to be transparent already? :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Haha! I love those Trell! I'll get them up right away with Whitefind, and a new one of mine. I love the first one. So typical of starts.    Cool! ^_^ I love them lots!And Delphi... you just take the eraser tool, and get rid of the white. It don't take to long. They were supposed to be transparent, but when I saved them, they never stayed. Oh well.I hope to see one soon!Keep em' up Trell! (I'll have to try and make more sprites of you. Unfortunatly Trellia dosen't move much.)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*phew* That's a lot! Thanks guys! I haven't tried to color anything yet - busy, busy, busy! - But I'll give it a shot soon! Thanks for all your help!If I have any questions, I'll post it in here to all of you smart Photoshop people... ^^

Ok, here's the deal... I'm sure some of you have heard already, because I've been stuck here FOREVER! But I'm haveing some really stupid problems with Final Fantasy 6, and I could use some help before I become a danger to the public.Anyways...When you first meet Sabin, in battle with that Vargas guy (I think that's his name), at the beginning of the game. Sabin jumps in battle, and you are supposed to use a Blitz attack. It tells you press "left, right, left" then X to execute it. Guess what?! It wont bloody well work!!!I know it's very simple... but I'm telling you it wont work! Even Delphi and Jader tried it, and it still wont go. So fine... maybe it was my controller... nope. I got a new controller and it still wont work.Can anybody help me out? I need it!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Those are cool, Trel!DT, you have to save them in GIF format in order for them to be transparent.I wish I knew how to make those.  But even if I did I wouldn't be able to come up with anything good anyway.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I don't know how to make those things.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the timing is off, you prolly hit the exicution button then did the code, you do the code then the 'ok' button.and or you could be doing it backwards
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
...Ok, I have a question already...Is there a bucket fill thingy? Where is it?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah come on... you could come up with something. Look at ours... o_OAnd yeah, I did save them as a gif... but it still didn't work!

Um...I have 5.5, but if 6.0 is anything like it, the fill tool just looks like it normally does--like a bucket spilling paint, and on 5.5 it's right under the measure tool (the ruler), almost at the bottom of the tool bar.Delphi, you can use the line tool to make a straight line--assuming again that 6.0 is like 5.5, then on the tool bar, if you click the pencil tool and hold the mouse down, then you should be able to choose the line tool. Or, assuming once more that 6.0 isn't much different from 5.5, there would be a window with three tabs that say "swatches" "brushes" and "color," swatches is just the palette, colors lets you make whatever shade you want, and brushes is where you choose the type of paint brush that you want.

Oooh, oooh, I can answer that question, Doom! (oh my God, ONE thing I can answer!) Yep, there's a flood bucket, but it's hidden. You have to either right click on the icon for the 'Gradient Tool' (it's beside the Eraser) or just normally click and hold down the mouse button on that same icon to get a little pop up menu to show up. From that thing, click the Flood Bucket icon.Tethys: No, I mean, I can't seem to find a brush I actually like. All the brushes I have are really really ... weak, I guess. Paint Shop Pro lets you select the size of the brush and the hardness/opacity from the Tool menu, but Photoshop here is making it a little harder on me. All the brushes they give you kinda suck for the type of coloring I want to do, and I can't seem to make a decent one...

Okay, I drew the Arctic Ocean Gaurdian, that's 3 out of four.  But he has no name yet.  I based his appearance on an ancient crocodilian, with the tail of a specific kind of mososaur (I forget the names) and I tried to make the head a bit more dragon-like.http//www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/DisplayImg.pl?INO=121710Oh yeah, I figured out that there were 4 oceans about 65 million years ago, when they were just starting to look somewhat like they do now.  So now I can say the Gaurdians are 65 million years old.

i was gonna make my own sprites...or more for you with ecco at 3 quator angels and such or from other games.I'm too lazy
</div>

<div id='container'>
lol, That's pretty cool.It said there was insufficient room on Drive C.

Hmm, I thought about sending it to some people I don't like, but I doubt they'd open anything from me.

<div id='container'>
Hey, I like those! Ecco looks cute and that Guardian is nifty. Let me know what you name him, huh?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I haven't been able to think of anything as of now, and I have tried.  Like I said, I don't know how to make them anyway.  I mean it would be simple enough to just take some backgrounds and paste the sprites onto them, but then you have to actually edit them so they're not just sitting there all the time.  And I don't know how to do that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Lol, those are cute!  ^_^

Hey, those are great! =) Concerning the white boxes, I just saved the sprites as bmps...and umm, in the program (The GIMP and MSPaint), I just either cut away the white using the magc wand tool, or in MSPaint, objects can be copied, and if you look, theres a lil button in the toolbar that makes white transparent, so you can copy them into the strip. =) Confused? Good! wink:

Okay time for my tips  "Adobe Photoshop 6.0 Classroom in a book" ISBN 0-201-71016-1. I'll set you back about $65 CAN, but it covers just about everything you'd ever wanna know from how to get the most out of the tools to the science of colormatching and prepress work. Plus how to use ImageReady to design all those slice-frame websites that are so popular.Delphi I'm also a wacom whore, so I hardly touch the brushes panel. Size 3 painbrush directly emulates a #2 pencil for me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Al! You made 6?! Whoo-who! That's great! Send them over an I'll put them up right away! I'd love to see them! Heh heh. I bet those a cool.And all that stuff you just said. Phew... right over my head. I just use the eraser tool to get rid of the white. I have Paint SHop Pro, and that's real easy to use.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
AHHHHH!!! Those are sooooo cute!!! I love them! Your chibi drawings are alsways so good! I realy like the "Delphi Wondering" one. Very cute!!! ^_^

<div id='container'>
Hey Al... you stop yer smiling, this isn't funny! I'm really stuck!!!And Eao... I've tried it both ways! Left, right, left... right, left, right... and I really am doing it right! I've tried so many times! That's not the problem. There must be something else.._. So... frustrating....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I liked the new pages eao heh don't worry eao there were alot of people who didn't want to be in the blundercaves but the reason they were put in it originally was to make fun of thwem not cause they wanted to be in it.I made the bludnercaves to make fun of everyone on the undercaves!

I will make the comix section soon and make sure i get everyones comix up. I feel bad for not being around as much as i shold to work on all this with you guys.My project involves changing the intire website and redoing every section all over again which kinda sucks for me since this website has 50 sections. but when this projects done the site will have the ability to update itself if you know what i mean......what i mean is YOU will update the site ha ha ha well sorta...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i took a bref look at them. i wish i could make a section to add them up but not yet...you will see what i eman when i get it all done.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
wow you people are relly into these comix.i want you people to emil these things so i can prepare them when im ready to make a comix section...damn
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
damn hist i want to get to it but i got enough crap as it is.I'm trying to bring out the big guns right now.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh interesting. he reminds me of myself.I have to be honest with you trellia but even though you ripped those sprite sheets yourself they arent relly yours. the images come from the ecco game. but then again im sure someone in the past has made good points on to why you shouldnt steal someones work. my idea is this. if your gonna make sprites and give them out your asking people to use them. trellia your website supplies sprites to people to use as they wish. otherwise why the fuck do you have them up? to look good?he didnt steal all your sprites and add them to his site he just used them for his stupid comic- i assume.heres a reason to get mad at him. if he stole all his sprites for his site much like if psysonic stole them for his site and put them in his own section and gave you no credict or permission.even if that happens theres nothing that can be done unless your gonna take legal action and on sprites i doubt its relly possible since they are owned by sega - unless otherwise you made them yourself.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the game boy advance ecco hasnt come out yet but they should be releasig it soon.from what i heard its just ecco one, possibly spiffyed up a bit fot the gba. so if you played ecco one for genesis expect the same thing, unless they ad surprises =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i have that problem too so don't worry. its basically beause the program is too old. the program only works for windows 95 and certain other windows configurations.so your not the only one.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the best part of playing the music without water sound fx makes it easy to make mp3's well have them up evetually but its gonna be a while. got alot of site designs to work out.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
wow your relly good at web design. hmmmm if you have the time maybe i consider you a job here that is if you have the time.I want to get others to still help with sections around here. well see
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
delphi you relly should consider doing a comic for the fun of it your relly good. I don't see why your so shy when it coems to your work much like your art when i asked you if youd like to add it to my site. you seemed kinda embarrised by it even though your good. you piss me off.on the other hand i relly wish i could get back into drawing. i got basically  a small amount of time to relly complete this website until its time for me to eathier begin fading away or what all.i have to go back to school :/
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Why not have someone who's been around a since the start and has some spare time write up the history and then Arkon can post it when he finds the time?  Teamwork baby, teamwork!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh i liked the ecco tethys, i havent been trying to update the website purposly latley so i could focus on working on my big project but when i seen you did artwork i couldnt refuse.heh thanks
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
you don't have to use his blitz attack. just attack vargas and kill him. the blitz doesnt relly take out alot of hp anyways. a normal attack can do te job just as well.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
eao i have to say that website you reffered is actualy a handy website to help out with web design, i made sure to put it in my favorites just to reference to.I may know html and stuf but there are codes i don't know but if i could learn can make this site kick more ass o.o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Alright, i know its been a while but heres what "the big project" is all about.It's called Enigma and what it does is allows the site to shapshift or morph into a new look.Some of the looks im incorporating into the design include1. The classic Arkonviox.com design from the first generation.2. The classic Arkonviox.com design from the enigma advance ( 2nd generation ) along with some of the other skins.3. The undercaves web design (it will make the website look how the undercaves did)4. a special new never seen before look called Ecco ps2.5. the special redesign made by crestoe and the main look to the website.Basically the new design will allow people to coose between looks and when chosen it will make the website look like it.What im asking is if anyone would like to contribute and make there own skins - looks?heres what you got to do thoughyou have to design how the main page will look use this as your examplehttp//arkonviox.com/temp.htmlthose are two pages one for the main page and the other is what all the sections go in called a template.Enigma is gonna be a very big and crazy project but i hope to have it done in a month. it will make the site more interactive and do lots of shit you have never seen before. I relly want people to help develope skins for it so if your up to it do it!Project Enigma will alsohave new features added to help me as the site maintainer do things easier some include a machine for processing the updates page, including past updates and more.a new interactive fanfare section with the special vitalits feature which if you find vitalits will activate a secreat profile ;)a remake of the ask arkon section, guestbook, and other interactive parts so become imbedded into enigma.also a new reviews section where you casn just submit reviews on your own.a new fanfare section where you can update your profile on your own without waiting for me to do it =)fanartwork will still have to be submitted via email or links but with a new site maintainer adding the new artwork is as easy as point and click. so artwork will be added on a basis and be a hellvalot easier for me.so tell me if you want in this. i also plan to add secreat templates =) from popular websites on the net. Enigkma has the ability to steal looks too heh pretty fucked up huh?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Arkon, I gotta hand it to you, this - kicks - ass. Count me in for making a skin! It'll be fun to doi, and it'll also feel nice to contribute more to the site :) Keep up the good work, can't wait to see this new Enigma in action.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay, thanksOnly option for this problem is a dual boot on my computer.So i can play older games on win 98.and the new games on win xp.I installed ecco on the computer of a friend and there was no problem ( win 98 ).But thanks anywayGreetings Liane
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I can't wait, I haven't played the original Ecco for years except on some duff emulated nonsense I got a while back. My god, the music too!!! WOWOWOW!!! :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I agree with what you say Jader, and personally I do find it very offensive that people use the term like they do.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I just hope they modify the music and make it even more spectacular. ^^; So, you want to find out what the site I go to is eh? Wel.. fine then ) Once the new Ecco comes out, I'm sure they'll grab it. They heve all bloody versions of Sonic advance for chrisake, so heh ^^;; D Ahh, I'm a Mac junkie and proud of it ^^;; Go me! :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I did this so......because.....it's wacky.I'd like to see it animated.  Mabye when you are done with everything else...because i don't know how to use flash.It can be either the animated version, or a blunder caves special.I don't know why I'm trying to keep it PG rated, the challange Prehaps?

<div id='container'>
According to Zophar.net, Boycott Advance comes in a windows flavor as well.Not a good idea to be posting rom site urls around here. I doubt Arkon wants his site closed down again.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Go ahead Eao, use what you'd like. Just rember to credits myself and the dolphin if you decide to draw off them or whatever. If you need/want names toss me an email or something.Same applies to anyone else.

<div id='container'>
He hasn't actually, he kinda changed it a long time ago to an hourglass dolphin. I'm going to send the book off by the end of this week, all the way up to Trellia.The reason the end of this week, is I need some more time to work in it ^^; as last week I was bogged down with school stuff.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds WAY cool! It'll be a tough project... but in the end it'll all be worth the wait! Keep up the awesome work Arkon!

Ah... you really think so? Thanks so much! I'm really glad you think so!I would love to help around here, but time can be a problem for me often. But if there is anything I can do, I'd be glad to try and help!!! Just let me know!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^_^ Thanks guys! Loads of help from you...But MAJOR problem!!!I've getting TONES of errors! Whenever I do anything it goes "program error", or when I tried to flood fill it said "abnormal error" and shuts down the program! I don't know what's going on.Any help, please?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
8O Boy, didn't expect much of a reply...!Tethys/Doomtrain/Vantid Yeah, lots of my dolphins have hair. I decided I didn't like my 'Delphi' image looking too much like 'Talyn', so I made Delphi have spunky hair instead of feathers like Talyn. I overdo the feather effect on my dolphins...Arkon?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Man oh man, do you ever sleep?!  mrgreen: Anyway... I'd help, but I suck at programming anything (hell, I can't even program my VCR to tape something for me) so uh... I'll leave that up to you. But anything else you might come up with, such as uh... well, whatever, I'll be glad to help!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
this doesnt involve programming delphi, all you got to do is use html to make a mainpage and a "template as i showed everyone and i will do the programmingwhat i want people to do is help contribute in making new website skins. all you need to do is use html and some graphics. then send it to me and i will make the poll work and all that.i want people to make a fake poll and fake everything else and i will turn them into a real poll and what all.basically your presenting to my design ideas. enigma will be able to do pretty much anything you can imagine my program is perfect!later on i will show you guys some of the designs i worked on.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
sounds good to me eao i think it woul be fun. maybe i can get crestoe to do the other characters. i mean your story is relly good! good enough to be considered better then most blundercaves. heh
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh sad to say i have the history in the palm of my hands.the first ecco the dolphin website called the undercaves once belonged to a guy named blackfin. then i took over the website and closed it down. i have the original undercaves forum as well as alot of old memorabilia of things people ever done.heh thats why i got to do it.doom i like your ideas about having a glyph tell about it or the asterite or something. you gave me a nice idea funny to say.let me finish enigma then i will consider doing it since i got new weapons.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh actualy dolphin the admins dont give a shit about what i do as long as i dont overload there server.besides it will just be a rom for gameboy advance. i can always throw it in a secreat page that can only be accessed by those i choose.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well the other option was buy another copy of ecco at the store. i had an old copy and bought one recently and they fixed the problem.

<div id='container'>
programming c++ is scary as fuckIts not scary. Its just stupid.Debugging C++ that someone else wrote, now thats frightening.C programs with flaws generally fail to compile with a consice compiler error that shows the function and line. C++ programs will fail at the container level which means you have to check every fucking class you inherited.Worse, its super easy to cause inconsistant operation by inheriting a class that has a null paramater thats different than the number of params that get passed to a child function that writes a memory space. You end up writing a null address, and in userspace, that crashes the program, and in kernel space, that causes the CPU to throw a STOP.

I dunno what the whole problem is.  I read the first twenty or so of sonic argh and they weren't that great.  They were actually really stupid.  Typical sonic community humor.  Its no match for the blundercaves.

He's NOT a crocodile.  I said I based his appearance off of an ancient crocodilian, one that has what looks like a combination of claws and flippers..But just because he looks reptilian doesn't mean he's cold-blooded. After all, Tethys's apearance is based off that of an elasmosaur, which is an ancient sea reptile, and she's actually a mammal.  Besides, he's immortal, so what does he care.  Actually I think that the Gaurdians probably aren't mammals or reptiles or fish (and definately not birds)..They're just...Gaurdians.Anyway, I did some research and found some possibilities for a name. But I can't decide between a few.  There's Alignak, which is the name of an Inuit god, which would make sense because they live way up north near the arctic.  And then there's Manannan, which is Irish and Celtic.  I also liked the name Condatis, another Celtic god, but he doesn't have much to do with the sea.  The problem with the Celtic names is that I want to reserve the name Llyr, which is Celtic, for either the Pacific Ocean Gaurdian or for the original Gaurdian of the single ocean Panthalassa.  And I don't want to use more than one name from the same kind of mythology.Also I want to mention that I am changing Amphitrite's name to Salacia (which happens to be the Roman equivelent).  Like I said, i don't want to use more than one name from the same type of mythology, and Tethys and Amphitrite are both Greek.  So I found the Roman name for the queen of the sea, Salacia, insead.So, anyway, I think I'll probably call the Arctic Ocean Gaurdian, Alignak.Ahem..Well, glad you guys like my drawings! ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tethys: No, I mean, I can't seem to find a brush I actually like. All the brushes I have are really really ... weak, I guess. Paint Shop Pro lets you select the size of the brush and the hardness/opacity from the Tool menu, but Photoshop here is making it a little harder on me. All the brushes they give you kinda suck for the type of coloring I want to do, and I can't seem to make a decent one...Well then I guess I don't really know what you mean when you say you can't find a brush that's hard enough, or just what you mean when you say they're weak.

Oh, and eventhough you may have already found out...by turning the sound effects down and playing a level, there's some points where there's dead silence. Kind of irritating, but I guess that's how it has to be. Don't worry though, once you get to a certain point in the level, the music will kick in!Speaking of music...did you know that the 21 tracks that are available to listen to in the Dreamcast's Audio section are not all the same as the 21 available in the PS2's Soundtrack Library in the Gallery...? 'Tis true! I wonder why the decided to change some of 'em...hmm...Anyway, about Lair of Evil...in case you haven't figured it out yet...and happen to come here before doing so...here's a tip. You can't break the vine with all that tension on it with the machine on...so you have to find the switch to turn it off (will be green when on, then red when off), then find the Sonar Power-up. That way you can untangle the wheel. Make sure before leaving, you turn it back on though...heheh! Hope that helps, or at least that you've already figured it out... ;)

Yea... ;) ...I like your style!

cpu0: AMD Athlon Model 6 (Palomino) ("AuthenticAMD" 686-class) 1.47 GHzreal mem  = 536391680 (523820K)Pretty big jump from a P3 500 and 256mb.Anyway IRC should be more stable, and the box should be faster in general.If you've got a site on there thats has files in it, please, check that I've got everything copied correctly and such. The old server is scheduled for scrapping, so if you don't get back to me by next monday, its probably too late to salvage anything from the old disks.

Am about to complete the game, had to look on the guide how to kill the heart in Heart of the Foe. I worked out the bit about blasting the green things into the heart with the sonar, but not that you had to charge it afterwards. D'uh.:)

evil evil evil sonic style art!!! ahhhhhhh!!!!know what i got to say about that kind of art in general? (not yours or swifty's of course)http://www.solfire.com/yna/showimage.php?ident=oCeLoT&amp;name=squish.jpgjust...in general
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yup...hehehe! Sometimes the solution is so simple, yet you just can't seem to figure it out - perhaps it's due to thinking too hard or something...heh! Anyway, that's awesome yer about to finish the game... :D ...congrats, early!

We'll never stop! MWA HA HA! After all, you ARE on a site that has quite a following of kids... or shall we say 'young adults'? Just because I don't need some stupid "I'M NOT A KID!" posts or anything directed at me... ;)

if you rerember from, a while ago...I mentioned it, yeah I made it...poor Arky is soo busy so I need help making it tick, incase it dosen't do it's job.so....mainly the Live journal one is up and so far has had 2 people post! one of them 3 times!huzzah hurrah yeah yippide-doo!and if one crazy person wants to be one of those buyers...it dosent matter much I think, because *shrugs* its fine now.-Eao, peturbed at the nature of school

<div id='container'>
*pisses herself laughin' at the "squish" pic'* OMG, that's freakin' funny!Don't get me wrong, I like Sonic. I'm an old fan, I even named my first pet hedgehog (was a male) Sonic. XDAnd Tethys, cool pic's. That Guardina critter kicks much ass. ^_^

It sounds really cool!I'd contribute something if I knew how to make something like that, or if I had any ideas as to what I could do.

tethys my advice is you could even just draw it and make the graphics if you can. it can look any way you want since enigma can morph the website any way. give it a trieand thanks dg heh ;)

you should just download one of my roms and emualtors then you will be able to play ecco for genesis.

<div id='container'>
*laughs at the sonic squished pic* oh my god! they killed sonic!... i'll leave the rest of that quote be now ;)as for your pics, i really love them, Tethys! the guardian is very nice, i like the overall look of him. i also believe the name Alignak fits him best out of the other choices, but that is just my opinion...still, really nice job there! the little mobian ecco certainly is unique, i had never seen that kind of style applied to a dolphin before ^_^
</div>

haha, thanx guys ;) im almost done a third one now :D

<div id='container'>
wow trellia i have to say your art has improved. your pictures PDG (pretty damn good)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
wow, you have a compy just like mine (almost) AuthenticAMD (AMD-K6).Big difference between a K6 and an Athlon XP ;)Whoa, hey... what's going on? That stuff went right over my head!Should I check and make sure everything works properly? All my files still seem to work fine. Is there something I should be doing?If it seems like you have all your files, good chance that you do. Its just that the old server is probably going to be scrapped, and so after monday anything thats missing is unrecoverable.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I kinda suck at this, so I went and asked a friend ?I have to agree. It seems like the base form is that of an Iguana, in which case the forelimbs are a bit too close the the ventral centerline of the body, and the rear limbs should lay at a backwards angle with the pelvis resting on the ground surface.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yup... ;) ...I'm serious! We all care about ya man!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well gee... :? ...I sure hope no one's missing anything after Monday!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've got a great idea...  ...just close the frickin topic already...it's turning into an incredible waste of time!  Oh, and Delphi...you're right...perhaps if I really wanted to get away from the childish shit that goes on here, I'd leave...anyway, I'm done with all this nonsense... 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well...based on how your dragon art is now Trellia...after you start developing more skills like you want to, you should just kick ass at drawing them! Congrats on improving your wonderful talent! ;) Oh yeah, I'd comment more, but alas, I'm no frickin artist...eheh!

<div id='container'>
Uhm... :| ...okay...I guess that person doesn't like Sonic...?!heh. DG, its basically poking fun at the overuse of sonic style art. a lot of people copy that style, change the color and add a few earring or whatever of pre existing sonic characters and slap these big "whhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa!!!! thisee MY chara, NO STEALING!!! its MY style!!! ya!". sonix been abused. severely.

That rocks Trellia! I love dragons! I think it's look really cool, and your shading is good too. ^_^I'm not much of a dragon artist or anything, but I think if you look up dinosaurs, that will help a lot. You know, for you muscles and stuff like that. Maybe that will help!

Defender of the Future is a great game. Sure it's not my favorite of the series. That honor goes to Tides of Time. But I enjoyed every bit of it. Not too many games make good transition to the three dimensional world, and Ecco made it quite nicely. Even though the old Ecco "feel" was gone(like what of the Asterite and Time Machine?), the worlds and overall execution were breathtaking. I don't think I'll bother with the PS2 version, though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yep...well congratulations on getting to the end of EccoD ...that's awesome! So, how'd you like those secret levels? Pretty cool eh!? Anyway, again, congrats! So, do you already have all those vitalits...or do ya gotta go searching for 'em now?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...yea, I figured something to that effect...don't worry, I wasn't shocked or upset...heheh, it was just a bit of sarcasm... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Interesting how the poll question is set up...so, I answered "No" because I was referring to the fact you weren't the only one...heheh, cus I'm often on here that late as well. So, "Yes" to the other question about "does anyone else do this?". Usually though it's about 2am when I get off, but there's been plenty of times when I've gone longer...I think the record was staying up clear till sometime after 5am...on the computer...heheh! So, I'm another example of making you not alone... ;) ...terrible aren't we?!

You know, I had been wondering, since I'm only a Pod Member, how come I can post stickies?Even tho I've already seen this, I didn't think to say anything before.I think you should add a part for Earth Clan.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Just what was wrong with that site that went against the terms?And doesn't that mean that some of those FLASH things you posted in OT goes against regulations?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It looks pretty good to me.  I didn't really look at it long enough to notice anything that Shadow's friend said.  I never look at pictures very long.  It looks kinda furry, tho, is it supposed to look that way?The only thing I can say is to look at actual lizards for the anatomy.  Dinosaurs are good, but you have to keep in mind all pictures of dinosaurs are artist renderings.  It would be better to look at actual photographs of lizards.  It would also be a good idea to look pictures of dragons by other artists, but I still think that even the most realistic drawing is no match for an actual photo.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Uh, Vantid, I can't see that picture.  I get an error every time, even when I copy&amp;pasted the url.Well, you know, that's why I've been trying to work on drawing furries in a different style.  But I've been a Sonic fan since the beginning, so that's how I learned to draw them.  And for some reason I thought it would be fun to draw Ecco like that.And actually Archie has a dolphin character, from the Forty Fathom Freedom Fighters, who've made about 2 appearances, at least that I'm aware of.  His name is Bottlenose..e.e;;  And I don't like the way he's drawn, either, it looks stupid.Ahem...Yeah, so, I've already decided to call him Alignak.  I think it soudns cool.  The original gaurdian will either be Llyr or Manannan (or the Welsh versian Manawydan).  They're both Celtic, I love Celtic stuff.  Now I just need to figure out the name for the Pacific Ocean Gaurdian..But first, I have to figure out what they both look like.

Alright just to explain to you folks again i been working on the ultimate project for this website giving it the ability to change looks.Enigma basically takes a section which looks like this -http//arkonviox.com/enigma/enigma.php?id=template&amp;user_style=dofi have alot of the skins available for preview but just know you won't get to see the ultimate redesign of the website that crestoe did until enigmas released.here we goearth clanhttp//arkonviox.com/enigma/enigma.php?id=template&amp;user_style=undercavesthis is what i got so far to my undercaves look. i havent added the side menu but i hope to have it just like how blackfin had it will a little bit of a change.eaoskinhttpPecco dof ps2http://arkonviox.com/enigma/enigma.php?id=template&amp;user_style=ps2this was gonna be the redesign until we found out of compition tried to out do us. thats why were making enigma to whoop the ass of any one who comes between splitting the ecco community againi just got a skin by doom train today but that wont be added till much later. for those of you planning on doing skins i hope this helped give you an idea. i can fix anything you fuck up so i encourage everyone to get in on this.

I'll bet most of you think the game's name, ECCO, is just a play on the word 'echo'. Well, I know the true origins of the name and the game itself...A while back I was watching an anime (japanese animation) called Serial Experiments Lain, and I saw something that made me think of the game ECCO immediately.Transcription of the relevant part of Serial Experiments Lain - LayerConducting sensory deprivation experiments using Native American narcotics and isolation tanks to probe the human unconscious, John C. Lilly believed his experiments connected him to cosmic entities by way of a communication network. Lilly dubbed the beings that guided him E.C.C.O., Earth Coincidence Control Office. Afterwards, Lilly began work on communication work with dolphins. Dolphins are creatures which  are able to conduct wide-range networking in the water via ulttasonic waves.So, my interest having been sparked, I researched a bit more.. http Earth Coincidence Control Office, a model by John C. Lilly for describing a higher or foriegn (to earth) intelligance which determines our coincidencesI wondered if E.C.C.O. and John C. Lilly might be more than just invented for plot purposes by Lain's writers..Apparently Lilly is indeed a real person and he did think up this Earth Coincidence Control Office stuff. http//www.laserdiscarchive.co.uk/laserdisc_archive/pioneer/pioneer_cld-a100/pioneer_cld-a100.htmPioneer's LD-based computer game format, LaserActive, was launched in Japan on August 20th. The US is expected to follow on before the end of the year. Pioneer describes LaserActive as an "in­teractive home-entertainment system"that is based around a new Y89,800 modular comb player, the CLD-A100. NEC also cloned the A100 and launched the player as the NEC PDE-LD1.A front panel recess (bottom left-hand corner, behind a flap) is designed to accommodate plug in modules, three of which have so far been announced. The Y39,000 PAC-S1 is required for SEGA Mega discs, the Y39,000 PAC-N1 for NEC system discs and the Y20,000 PAC-K1 is for karaoke. Each of the modules has the ability to decode CD+Graphics. The SEGA and NEC modules will play existing CD and cartridge games as well as Pioneer have newly developed LD-based ones. The August player launch was accompanied by five Y9,800 laserdiscs with five more planned by October. By the year-end Pioneer expects to have 17 LaserActive titles available. ...Initial LaserActive Discs...Melon Brain - The title is a reference to the melon-shaped brain that it is unique to dolphins. Dr John C. Lilly a leading authority on dolphins. Bob Talbot a top underwater cameraman, and Estelle Myers, the Australian dolphin researcher are putting together this interactive programme. (Provisional February 1994 release.) Interesting, isn't it?P.S. to the webmaster of this site - feel free to put this somewhere like the Info sections if you like.

flahs movie/cartoon is just that, untill now Killfrog.com cartoons were only on the site, they have dvds now to buy, but we should all buy segas and nintendos and games, not nab computer versions with special things to them for free. what if you make your own emulator system and your own games?don't be kind, sell them for 50 bucks a system and 14 for a game!

It's cus you always want what you can't have...we humans are so complex. Kids want to be adults, and adults want to be kids. If yer made to go to bed, you don't want to...whereas if you want to go to bed...something will likely get in the way and prevent you from doing so. At least...that's my philosophy...heh!

I think the main stumble block is that most people think plan view, front aspect on a bottlenose dolphin is a circle, when really its more like a triangle with radiused corners.  Something else to note is that with the dolphin's fusiform shape at neutral, the ventral surface is almost linear, and theres very little taper on the lower jaw portion of the rostrum.My other complaint is that too many people model the point where the tail flukes join the peduncle as round, when really its more of a thin elipse sectionally. Most bottlenose I've seen have a definite dorsal ridge from pretty much the dorsal fin to the flukes, again mirroring the triangle shape.

heh i made a caverns of hope one for fun but that wont make it into the final design. heres a screenshot.http://arkonviox.com/objects/coh.jpgheh now tell me whats worse, when the enemy thinks they have out done you in design or when you out did them in everything they could possibly imagine?I took Ecco's approach, sometimes to escape the enemy you must become the enemy =)oh and doomtrain your skin will be the next one i get together along with a very nice one whitefin gave me from her website!

i didn't relly like david brins appraoch, but im glad we got some of the things from the old ecco like hanging waters. i had always wanted to see the water tubes in 3D and seeing it was like a dream i had.which brings me to the real purpose to this site besides being the dominent ecco website! the real purpose is to keep ecco alive and an old community together.

dolphin your forgetting, i have mp3's and roms on this site already, and thats pretty illegal.but as you can see host department doesnt give a rats ass, as long as they arent getting bugged about it.all host department cares about is there servers getting jammed by cgi programs and related.one thing i learned about laws and rules are some can be broken while others can be bent.if anything happens to this server i have to get a refund,and if not which is probably under there terms of service, then i will simply find another server.heh but i like host department besides what they done to me. i get all this free crap and 800 megs of space!the best thing to do before adding that rom up is possibly waiting. nintendo is the only gaming company that will get on your ass about roms. they relly watch you like a hawk and are the ones that took out many popular rom sites.

its cool how ecco is all 3D now...the levels are eye candy, ill give you that. but yeah, the foe just sucks ass, gimme a damn vortex drone any day! e.e;;sure, some of the levels were interesting, but can you image the original atlantis on a ps2 or dreamcast? what about trellias bay! even the vortex queen would be better than the heart of the foe! i wish they could have put the prehistoric levels in from ecco 1. you know what else sorta sucked about new ecco games, theres no metaspheres. that was one of the main highlights of TOT! *thinks* wouldnt it be cool, if like ecco jr you could be diferent people? kitnee, ecco, trellia, tara, big blue, and even a vortex? the game would be different each time you play on each different person!! what if you design your own char!!! ahhh! thats would be too awsome....never mind...im a dreamer ._.;

Once I was on the internet in an RPG chat until after 3 am, on a weekend.  I was suspended from the computer for a day.Now I get of at 10 on weekdays and 12 on weekends and vacation days.  My dad has a bad habit of getting up in the middle of the night, and if I'm still on he'll yell at me.  But then I just go in my room and draw for a couple of hours.I guess since I'm 18 now my parents might not mind so much, but on the other hand I am still in High School.  I don't like to stay up too late if I have to go to school the next day or get up early for any other reason.In any case, even if I did stay up that late, I wouldn't be at the forum.  Once I'm done looking at all the topics I want to look at, I don't see any reason to hang around.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Um, it probably means the URL is wrong or doesn't exist, but there might be other reasons why that comes up.  I'm not sure, I've gotten that a few times before, but I never tried to do anything about it.

If I wanted to draw a dolphin realistically, I would have looked at some photos.I think the main stumble block is that most people think plan view, front aspect on a bottlenose dolphin is a circle, when really its more like a triangle with radiused corners.  Something else to note is that with the dolphin's fusiform shape at neutral, the ventral surface is almost linear, and theres very little taper on the lower jaw portion of the rostrum.Um...what is a "rostrum"?

Angelfire is like geocities... they don't allow off site linking. Same with tripod. They have a little image like that too. Just geocities.com dosen't. If you try to link to an image at angelfire or tripod, they replace it with that. Geocities just dosen't let you, and shows you a broken image.All you have to do is copy and paste just like it's geocities. Same thing!

You know what would rock? An Ecco collectors pak on the PS2, with the original two games in their original 2D format with updated graphics plus DotF and maybe a sequel to the original story arc.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Um...what is a "rostrum"?The rostrum is what most people think of as the beak or nose of a dolphin, basically the general jaw area.

Well, for the PS2 version, I'm not sure if it's that you have to collect all the vitalits for those two secret levels, or if it's just that you have to beat the game (no matter how many vitalits you have).  Prime Mover...ya think you could answer that for us since you've beaten the game without 100% of the vitalits? You can quick check if you haven't been to the secret levels yet if you go to the Level Select screen, and if Up and Down is all sparkly...then it must be that you only need to beat the game to get to Passage from Genesis, and Pathways from Nowhere.Trellia... ) ...best of luck!

I think it's really good.  I don't think I could do that with watercolors.I myself am not fond of painting with watercolors.  I have to do a watercolor for my art class.  There's this area on my photo that's a really dark blue, and no matter what, I can't get it dark enough.  I can only add so much black and have it still look like blue.  It looks fine when the paint is wet, but when it dries it turns about 10 shades lighter.  And all we have to use are these little crappy brushes, which makes it impossible to make it look smooth.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
o_OCool pic' Eao!!! Awesome... ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
So that site had illegal ROMs on it?  Or are you saying they're all illegal?Hm, does anyone know what ROM stands for? I'm just suddenly curious..

Hey Delphi? Your saying your having trouble with your brushes right? Well, if you right click on a brush you can normally toggle with its settings and such, maybe then you can set it to how you need it to be. Shadow) Then I can perhaps secretly send this Acecad to Trellia :D ^^;;;

Praise the FF godz! I finially did it!!!  I decided to give it a try Arkon's way, but that Doom Fist was getting the better of me so I just thought I'd give that Blitz one last shot... and it worked! Somehow, it worked!Maybe it is my new controller... I'm not sure, but it worked! I'm so happy, I can finially get on with the rest of the game!!! WHOO-WHO!!! It's about time!

heh eao your wishing for things you just end up regreting. besides people love you, you just don't notice it cause you probably want more and thats your problem.not to worry though im the same way.but onto a different story...I Fifannly have enigma perfected every bug worked out every function giving a good solid flex and after constantly reprogramming it about three to four times im satisfied with what i got.So that means on to the next phase of enigma. now that its 75% completed i need to finish the last part and find the last globe to make it compelte. I have to create a panel for people to be able to customize it at will and an admin  panel so i can easiely add skins at will.when everythings said and done i hope it works out for the best.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh to be honest not many people have the motivation i have to keep going. if you ever looked at my "compition" sure they have two people updating a website but you know soemthing...cobmiend the two of them they still don't update as much as they should.my point is its gonna be hard to find soemone to work at my pace for no apparent reason.the only thing i can do is trie to motivate others into contributing. i think that actualy works the best. like the fanfare section damn i got people joining in like crazy writing ecco storys and you name it!Im proud that soemthing i worked hard for is picking up. my goal is to make this site outperform what an ecco site should.to me since the ecco community is slim to nothing i beleive we make this community so different and enigma is that promise!no one can fuck with me! ha ha
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well you guys need to remember that this board is long over due for an upgrade although the upgrade probably wont be too different.oh and hist your the only one who would be considered untochable level. too bad crestoe isnt running the lackeys as he should. things with that will change but right now im trying to "pickj up broken pieces" before i get this site rollin as it should.
</div>

if you remmeber i was getting rid of topics where he just cried about blackfin being gone.then he stopped coming and started his lame excuse for a site.

<div id='container'>
roms in general are illegal yes!and roms mean read only memory which means like cd-ROMs they can only be read to not written too.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
that would be cool and maybe some hidden features, blackfin will actualy have a blackfin and hell anything of the above would be awesome.I just wish in the new ecco they stuck to the original story but you know. if they make an ecco sequel then maybe they will shut me up once and for all. lets just see if they are up to it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
getting the vitalits isnt relly a big deal though. i relly think there not. for the ps2 version though maybe if you relly want to see the paintings in the art gallery but well have that up later one. it hasnt rlely been requested you know.

Hi all! I am Artreus, and I am new here. I am also an author (I like to think) and I would value any input you have on Prelude to the Rising, found in the fanfare section. The story sets up events for my current project, Song of the Rising. It is about half done so if you want me to develop any of the characters or ideas in Prelude you can reach me at AJ@Arkonviox.com. Keep in mind this is my first work so if you don't like it TELL ME so I can correct my error.

I've always liked the Title music for TOT, but I think I liked Jurasic beach from Ecco 1. Oh, I thought Trellia's Bay was good too. Havne't found a good Mid version though.Well, what I remember best about TOT was after I first beat TOT. I couldn't listen to the time warp music for a week! To me it represented the end of Ecco. Then DoF came out an I had something to look forward to.

Well, I just learned in English class you're supposed to Pre-write first, but I ignored that lesson. What works best for me is to just start writing. If you have an idea, put it on paper (or computer screen, whatever works for you) After developing your first ideas, fill in any gaps and use your own work to inspire other ideas. If your not sure about an idea, put it down anyway. You can get rid of it or change it later. If anything goes wrong, just start over again. Give it a shot, and try your best.

I was just wondering if anyone had any good recomendations on good books I could read. I find that I can NEVER find a book I like, so I don't read a hulla of lot, and I'd like to start. I read, like, NO books EVER! And computering isn't going to help my intelect all that much. ^^Betters the mind and all that sort. ^_- So I could use some good books to read. Tell me some books you like and what they are about, would be nice!So yeah, I love Final Fantasy (we all know that), but I don't really go for the sci-fi crap most often (Start Wars/Trek, and X-files... yick). I like books where you have to read between the lines and stuff though. Really imaginative stuff, you know (god, if the FF's where books, I'd have read them 40 times each)! I also like the real life stories (or possible real life stories).I just read "The Chrysalides" (sp?) for school, and I thought that was a pretty good book. So yeah, really imaginative books!Any help?

<div id='container'>
indeed, they sorta screwed us ol' skool ecco fans with DOTF...i mean, its great its out, but they should have stayed loyal to the ones who were there ever since the genesis games!yeah....i wonder what happend to the good old vortex queen...i remeber talking with NeoEcco about how the foe were a new breed of vortex, i cant remeber the full conversation...but id like to think the vortex didnt ALL die out ;) *grabs a vortex drone plushie and clings to it* heh heh heh, my how the times have changed ^_~

well, i should go back to the level and figure out whats really wrong..i mean, i probably could figure it out, but im just a little lazy ^.^ and of course, if i really DO get stuck, ill ask you DG ;) the only level that has gotten me so far is perils of the coral reef @_@ man, how many people have been stuck on that level? even with the walkthrough, i couldnt find how to get out of the level after beating the shark. oh well, i did evenutally ^^but arkon, just a suggestion, if at all possible, you should make blackfin's DOTF walkthrough images actually printable, cuz when you print it, ths all white with a few numbers @___o;; heh, ive had to trace the image most of the time ^^;; anyways...just a suggestion :)

Um...Since you said you don't like Sci-Fi that much, what about fantasy?Well, if you do like fantasy, I really liked The Song of the Lioness Quartet.    They are the First Adventure, In the Hand of the Goddess, The Woman Who Rides Like a Man, and Lioness Rampant.  The quartet is about a girl who wants to be a knight, and, in the first book, she dresses up as boy (this is when she's young enough to get away with that) so that she can train to be a knight.  She also has strong magical powers, but she doesn't like to use magic.  That's how it starts out, but there's a lot more to it than that.  The books take place over many years, so by the end she's a young adult. Oh yeah, the author is Tamora Pierce.Also, I am in the middle of the fourth book of The Pendragon Cycle, by Stephen R. Lawhead, which I would also recommend.  There are 5 books, and they relate to Merlin and King Arthur.  The books are Taliesin, Merlin, Arthur, Pendragon, and Grail.  The thing I like about these books is they take a more realistic twist on the legends.  There is a little bit of magic and some miracles here and there, but for the most part the ideas are more realistic.  And they're written incredibly well, the imagery is astounding.  I don't know if you'd like these books, but I hope that helps.

This website is great!  I love it!  http Pronunciation{thee'-thus} Okay, that's messed up.  First of all, there's no H after the first T.  Either way it sounds really stupid.  But I think that's the original pronunciation, a lot of those names are pronounced differently now than they used to be.  In fact, most of them are.  I think that now, judging from the modern pronunciations of other Greek names, it would be more like "tayth-iss".Well, I don't care how it's supposed to be pronounced.  I'm going to pronounce it however I want.  My character is not the same as the titaness of Greek mythology, so she can pronounce her name differently if she wants to.Um, maybe nobody cares about any of that, but I do.  And I just felt like sharing it.

Alastor -'Loss-tor'In Greek mythology, Alastor is an avenging demon, associated with blood feuds between families, and the Greek term for an avenging power that visits the sins of the fathers on their children. It is also an evil genius of a house that leads a man to commit crimes and sin. He was originally a mortal, the son of Neleus, king of Pylos. He became a (minor) demon when he and his brothers were slain by Heracles. I didn't...know...this...o_O

Stenellya... this might not help much coming from a total stranger, but I used to feel stressed and depressed all the time.  I actually was tested for Depression and the test had a max score of 40 whereas 20 and above qualified for depression.  I scored a 33.  By my senior year in highschool, I was sick and tired of feeling that way.  I had to force myself to be more optimistic and more friendly.  It's almost been 2 years since I made that decision, and though I'm still not where I want to be, I do feel much happier.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that sometimes you can't find the happiness you want... you got to build it.  It's nice to meet ya Kitnee.

Now, onto N64 Roms, they are what they say, 64, 64mb + download. I've gotten Pokemon Stadium before and could run it rather well on Os 9 with a shit emu. I know that alot of really powerful PC's can run it, but its just the matter of having the right emu. I know that playstation is emulated, but because they're CDs, you can't rip the data to make a ROM, unless you've made a program that can do so. Letsee... PS2 Emus have yet to be made, and once they are I have the best game's demo disc to use on it Well, thats my say*blip!*

Well, you know I don't like my type of books, Train. But may I steer you away from the Song of the Lioness Quartet. You wouldn't like those. No offense to Tethys meant, of course!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
mbaye that ocen chick was part fish?Part fish? No way.  Tethys is a titaness.  I guess I kinda assumed they resembled humans like the gods do, since after all the gods descended from the titans.  But I guess I'm not so sure.  Anyway the idea is that the titans and gods created everything, including the planet and everything on it.  And a lot of those things--the rivers, lakes, mountains, oceans, etc.--were children of the titans.  Even the Earth, according to some of the older legends, was "born," there was one versian where it hatched from an egg.Alastor--I never heard of that.  I think that site has a lot of the older stories.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
3000 children, lord did they know how to put buns in the oven back then...But that is cool Teth, I always loved mythology.

Mobian ? You want to say from Mobius, the Sonic's planet Yeah, I already mentioned that Mobius is from the Sonic the Hedgehog comic series. I know that Mobian is the correct term because it's been used several times in the comic.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well since she didn't say she doesn't like fantasy, I just thought I'd mention it because I liked those books.  My only problem with the Song of the Lioness, besides the bad editing (I found several typos in all of them), is that it's quite cliche.  But well written, nonetheless.  IMHO.The pendragon Cycle is much better, tho.  And it's a unique and refreshing twist of the legends. Well, actually, Arthurian legend is something I've been into only recently, so I really have very little to compare it with...But it has good reviews!Er, yeah, I guess I don't need to say anything more about those books..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh!  I thought of another one!  I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.  I have no idea who the author is.  I had to read it for English a couple years ago, but I really liked it alot.  But I'm not sure if you'd like it, because the other girls in my group (we had different groups each reading a different book) thought it was too weird.  It's about a girl with Schizophrenia and how she recovers.I have read a lot of really good books in my lifetime.  But I have a hard time thinking of all of them.  My favorite author is Cristopher Pike, but he does a lot of sci-fi type stuff.  But some of his books are more realistic, like The Midnight Club.  There's nothing sci-fi in it and there's no vampires or witches or ghosts or whatever else.If I kept on thinking I could probably list hundreds of books.  I love to read.  So, maybe it's a good idea for me to not say anymore while I can still manage to make myself shutup.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, I dunno. Maybe it's kinda like this one older myth.  The one I mentioned about the Earth hatching from an egg.  Actually, it was that Eurynome (she was referred to as a goddess in the book I have, but that seems awfully strange considering, at least in most versians, the first gods were born later on to Rhea and Chronos) laid an egg that contained, basically, the universe--including the Earth, heavens, planets, stars, and the sun.  So, they were all born at the same time.  I dunno.  Greek myths are often pretty weird like that, especially the older ones.  The more modern versian is that Ge (mother Earth) bore all the things on Earth, except for man and those animals which the gods created (which might be all of them, I really don't know).So, um, anyway, my point is that if the Earth and sky and planets and sun and stars were all born from one egg, then maybe it was a similar case with the rivers and lakes.  Or, maybe they just never put much thought into that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I like the way Verra talks too. It is done that way to make her seem truly unknown and foreign. Then again, one wouldn't expect a dolphin to speak fluent English anyway, but thats something authors can get away with. There are (or will be) characters in the rest of the story that talk in their own way. Its kind of a way of showing their identity. As for it being too fast, thats because I really didn't have ideas for a plot behind Prelude, developments in part 1 required some introduction, so I threw together what I had. Its an interesting read, but all my good ideas are in the rest of the story. Ironically, Part 2 is moving very slowly and requires a lot of editing to liven it up so the reader feels like finishing the story.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
a wrinkle in time (Madeleine l'engle) is an AWSOME book. its sorta sci-fi, but id consider it more fantasy...about other galexies and such..worth a read =) julie of the wolves (jean craighead george)...i JUST finished reading it! its SOOOO frelling good! heh, van can back me up on that one ;) its about an inuit girl who survives on her own with the help of her wolves...yadda yadda. it has all theese awsome details of how she gets her self accepted into the pack...its good!and uh course, LOTR boox ^.^

right now owr chat room isnt working because the server it's on is being moved. I plan to set up a temparary palce for everyone to come soon enough.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Its probably gonna take a little more than a day.  I've got a whole network to move (read: close to 200 hosts) and so things like core services and customer websites take time prescidence over the irc server.In short, I'll get to it when I can. Its not very high on the things to do list.

Winter of Fire was wonderfulive mentioned the Golden One, Crismons Claw, and the Crystal Eye by Deborah Chester. its sci fi but only in that it takes place on an alien world. however, the aliens are feline ish, lizard ish, dog ish. Beautiful, sad books. i recommend them to anyone.uhhh....The Girl Who loved Tom Gordon by Stephen KingSilver Wolf, Night of the WolfDo you like animal fantasy? cuz i know of lots of em. besides all that Redwall crap. i used to be such a big fan...Watership down hell ya.

I wounder if Christain and friend's stories and belifes will be silly little myths one day, how great was ones religons, now knocked down from glory and called a dumb story.Once there was a creature called god, that was a god and there was only one, and it was a he, he made stuff and killed it and created hell for the peole he didn't want to deal with when they died.  There is no way out, and you never come back from dying, not even to repent or have fun.  Reincarnation was one silly idea people had so dog took it away because he didn't like it.  Then he fryed the differnt people who didn't belive in the things his friends did.

I've often thought about this as ecco started to thrill me less and less.  And so i started to think what would make a good ecco game, or at least what would make it more likable by the mainstream.So i took all the weak points from dotf.  Hippie New Agedness, stupidass ai, bmovie plot, go fetch gameplay, and most of all THOSE FUCKING PUZZLES.And we could make it more of an action game.  I was thinking that there are sonar powerups scattered throughout the game that gives your sonar some kind of weaponry for a limited time, just long enough to complete a task.  Instead of doing all this stupid crap like rescuing baby orcas, ecco starts to get down to business and take on the bad dudes like no bad dudes have been taken on before.  I want exploding Vortex installations, spaceships crashing into earth, and hijacked machinery.And the foe were so stupid, they wouldnt talk to you, had boring scripted attacks yadda yadda.  Well i want rivalries, i want asshole foe that ecco doesn't like and goes out of his way to attack.And more ideas fill in the blank.

<div id='container'>
My Ecco experience ends ay TOT, I havn't been able to play DotF.But what I've gathered is that the game needs more characters, more interaction. Another than stuff like 'you are great' and 'bring me a fish' the Genesis games didn't have much to offer, actually there were few levels with dolphins in it because the glyphs developed the story for you.
</div>

I've always liked Greek/Roman mythology. I signed up for a class in European history this year trying to learn more about it, but Ancient Greece was only covered in the first day, how dissapointing.  :(  I try to avoid getting character names from mythology though, They sound cool, but I don't want to mix up the names. I came close with Artreus. I believe Atreus, with one 'r,' was a noble family of greek mythology. And, as I just discovered they also has an Alpheus and Artemis. Put them all together and I guess you get Artreus. I've been trying to find stuff on Nyx, the greek goddess of night, I believe, but the name sounds to short to use.

Hey Trellia!!! You like A Wrinkle in Time, too? That's so cool! It's one of my favorite books! My teacher read it to us in grade four, and I've been looking for it since then... I finally found it, about a year ago, and it's still a good book. Have you read the sequals? I haven't, but I'd like to if I could fine them.Tethys, that book you said, "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden" sounds interesting to me. I started to read a book called "Icy Sparks" about a girl with TS, but in here time they didn't know what it was so... they just though she was a freak. I never finished it because my it was my cousin's, and she took off with it. Maybe I could look that up too. But yeah... I'm intested in this rose book now. ^_^ Thanks!Old fashion fantasy books I don't think I like very much. I do make many exeptions of course, but the really old school ones I don't think I really like. Nore animal books. Delphi was all into Redwall, and I didn't really like it too much. I find I can't relate to animals like that, I guess.But thanks everyone for all the sugestions! I'll have to look into some of the ones you've all mentioned.As you can tell... I'm a very picky reader. @_@ Which isn't good!

Hey, some people LIKE puzzles.I think the Ecco games could stand to use more variety.  A lot of the levels are very similar.Um, I was trying to think of something else but I guess that's all I can think of right now.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I only started to get into Greek Mythology a few years ago, and I still know very little about it.  But I know almost nothing about other mythology, tho I would like to learn.I don't know about Nyx, but there was a goddess called Night, who is involved in one of the older creation myths.  I can't remember if it comes before or after the one about Eurynome, but Night is basically another versian of Eurynome.You know, Eao, I had actually thought about that a few times before.  I don't know how long the Greeks beleived in what we now call mythology, but I'd bet that it was around for a longer time than Christianity has been around so far.   You have to realize that what we call mythology was actually the religions of the time.  In some thousands of years, I'm sure Christianity and all the other religions that exist today will be called mythology as well.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think they should re-make the first two games, in full 3d, with a redone version of the Genesis' soundtrack. Add new levels to the point where it alters the storyline that tiny fraction that matters. Then continue on with Ecco 3, and have all of the games have full motion FMV's in stunning graphics. Who cares what system its on, just give us more Ecco!

Hey Arkon... I got a question.Well you see, my Cute FTP demo ran out (a while ago), and buying one around here seems near impossible.

~Histronic's Guide to Free FTP for Cheapass Motherfuckers~Get rid of that goddamned ftp program you have, just uninstall it.  Then download cuteftp 2.8 which is exactly the same thing as the newest version, just not as pretty.  You can usually get it at abandoned spanish pirate sites.  It gets the job done just as well.  When you open it up, you'll e presented with a banner that asks you whether or not you want to start a 30 day trial.  If you press agree you start the trial BUT if you press Cancel the program runs without starting the 30 day trial!  You will be able to use it, provided every time you open it up you press "cancel" at the screen.  If you press agree it wil start the thirty day trial and you can't reverse it, so make sure you are concentrating more than usual when you open or you'll be SOL.  I know this is the most poor person thng you've ever heard but it gets the job done well enough for my site so go ahead.

<div id='container'>
You have a couch if i say you have a couch!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah but puzzles should never EVER be the main focus of a game.  Especially one categorized as an action game.  And when ecco kills sometig there should be blood and guts and yaargh.... make it m rated.And if ecco went to human land he'd probably wind up between two slices of bread.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
you got to find your own cracks but my only advice is download WS_FTP LE its out there if you know how to look. you got to learn how to se search engines like everyone else thats how i find everything.
</div>

there was a song called welcome to the machine, was it done by pink floyd?anyhow nonfish, i would be the webmaster of this site.Your information seems interesting but i don't think sega got it from John lilly. I seen his website a while back and my assumption was he had heard of the Ecco game. Some clues to this are E.C.C.O, Vortex, Dolphins, but then again all those relaed to the sea. the word Ecco has been used alot to interpret Echo. Then again the only one whod know about this would be Ed Annunziatta Ecco's creator who now owns AndNow
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Your story seemed interesting cause i can already see alot about your main character. He is distant from the others, seems as if he wants to go out in life on his own. Yet he still connects with them and doesnt act anti social to devide himself because he hates others. he does it cause he wants more in life.at least thats what i hope i caught. i have problems understanding what i read.Anyhow keep up the good work on your story, you should continue it anyways. There was a time long ago were i would look for ecco information and couldnt find anything. i wanted to find stories and everything but never could.I wanted to see artwork and anything i could get myhands on.I too am wiriting a story but i want to make it a game. im going back to school so i can learn how to develope on a good ol windows platform.you can look at it in my project arkon section. BTW arteus i did promise you to show you the project i was working on currently. its a project for the website. if your still itnerested in being in earth clan you have to make one promise.To stay on this site as a member! i don't introduce members to earth clan unless i can see they are willing to do this. If you can do that, then alls well in the sea.

The perfect Ecco game would be my game! the only reason i havent started it is i plan to go back to school to finish learning programming. so gimme a break.Plus i have to suceed in a big plan i had for this website. i want to make it so it can update itself ;)
</div>

<div id='container'>
you know whiefin they usualy make emus for PC before they do macs.but if it werent for macs i wouldnt know what an emulator was. back in the days when i had to make a power mac emulate the 68k macs. but why couldnt i make the 68k macs emulate the power pcs? the question to why was, if they did it then why would i need a power mac? and i woulsd have probably be better off with a power mac considering how slow it would become.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
John Lilly's work with dolphins and his ideas (admittedly pretty crazy) about E.C.C.O. predates the game. He didn't get it from the game.

I promise you, I intend to stay here for a while. I've been toying with the idea of writing a fanfic for a while. Your website came up while I was looking for... well, something   I began to write the story for something to do in my spare time. A month later I found what I had written, but it on the computer and worked on it regularly. About a month ago, something really clicked and I took off, The fic became a Trilogy, with even a name. Part 1 is done, but I won't post it yet. Part 2 is almost done, Part 2a, a side story I developed to happen between parts 2and 3 is done, and Part 3 dosn't even have a title yet. To keep stuff a little interesting, I intend to spread my talents. I am finishing something for the comix, and maybe later I'll doodle something on paper. Well, I am interested in project Arkon, and you know were to reach me.

the thing is i didnt know weather to belive you. for a sec i thought this E.C.C.O thing was recent and new i didnt know it was real-real!A big note to everyone else that i think we should all know is NonFish is on to something big!

<div id='container'>
Was the garden hose going where it isn't supposed to go?
</div>

<div id='container'>
I doubt that any of that has anything to do with Ecco the Dolphin.  Just because that thing is called E.C.C.O. and it has something to do with dolphins doesn't mean shit.  Why would Sega base a video game character on something like that, especially when it's not something many people even know about.  It's probably just pure coincedence.Now, I do seem to remember hearing or seeing something that made me think that the name Ecco isn't a play on echo...But it wasn't anything like what you were talking about.  I can't remember what it was, I just remember having a breif thought about it at some point.  I dunno....maybe it was just a dream or something...But I still think that E.C.C.O. thing is most likely just a coincedence.

Hey, glad to have you back!   HAHAHA! At my school, Seniors don't take final exams!  But, unfortunately, I know I'll have to take exams in college, which I start this Fall.

<div id='container'>
tethys, tonight were gonna reveal the answer to ecco's name! and funny to say in a way project E.C.C.O does link together with it.Thanks to NonFish for finding this big breakthrough all by himself!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh hahahhaa, very cute, but thats not what inspired Ed to make Ecco's name what it is. Do note that, a few countries languages spell echo as Ecco, can't remember what exctly though. So ner, the end.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
we have an answer now because i gave nonfish eds email and he got in touch with him and told him his findings and the answer is he was close.I have to say non fish when i seen this post i kinda thought "eh" but i could see you were very sure of yourself. congratulations for getting Ed Annuziate to email you seriously. The last one to email him and report her findings was Claire turner (whitefin)The better thing yet was i'm glad to have a finding by a visitor from my site and not some other flousy site like caverns of dopes.it kinda makes you feel there is hope in the ecco community after all and that ecco wont ever die as long as .Anyhow nonfish you should register in owr forum and become a full member then i can put you in earthclan. Might as well you earned it big time!
</div>

<div id='container'>
welcome back tidesinger. i know how much work you been doing after all i been trying to keep in touch. i hope you can get a break soon so you can come back on a regular basis. anyhow right now just do what you gottha do and soon all that hard work will pay off.

I know many of you are wondering what the hell happned with the artcontest?Basically i put it on a suspension. what that means is were freezing time for a bit before we end it.Originaly i was working on the fanfare section at the time and had to reorganize the all the art.I still havent finished cause there was still work i had to do on the art sections for vantid crestoe and swift.So to shorten things down, theres gonna be a round two coming soon. It will allow the art conest to go down with a blast rather then go down like a dead airliner from september 11th!So if anyone has any comments please tell fee free.

Haha corvoire just what i was going to say.... unlke you po' ass mofos i have an inflatable couch! O_O
</div>

<div id='container'>
I usually read sci-fi, so this may not help at all. Sci-fi's ok, I guess as long as you can tell whats going on. Well, sticking with the underwater theme (You're here aren't you?) I've recently read Startide Rising  by David Brin. Brin wrote the story line behing DoF: because of Startide. The're supposed to be making it into a movie, but I havn't heard much about that. There is also Cachalot by Dean Alan Foster, and Secrets of the Deep. That last one is the least sci-fi-ish of the three, at least its on Earth. Oh, and there is Atlantis Found by Clive Cussler, Thats an action book. Eveyone I know that has read it has enjoyed it. Hope this helps, but if it doesn't, It looks like you've still got a lot to choose from.

What's that Secrets of the Deep about? It sounds pretty interesting, by the title. Maybe I'll like that.I just took out a book called The Midwich Cukoos. I haven't started it yet (I just got it!), but hopfully it'll be good. It sounded pretty interesting to me anyways.

Nice to see you again, Tidey !Thanks for your answers.You're so nice with me ! It's great to have buddies on that chat !         =) Then, to answer to your question, Kit', I had a lot of probs with an ex-friend. Since the last summer, all is bad in my life anyway...

Hey, Tethys, do you have some scans of Sonic's comics ? Or, do you know a site where I can buy the comics ?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A game like "Ecco - DoTF", but with more levels, more dolphins' species, and a selection of characters (like in "Sonic Adventure").I also shall love to have a lot of levels with new environnements and species of fishes, cetaceans and shells. All the beings would be referenced in an encyclopedia, as the pokédex in " pokémon ".More probs using intelligence, like with the White Shark (even though I hated swimming in front of him ! I was scared ! lol).And the characters would be males or females: we shall can play with Ecco, a male bottlenose dolphin; or (for example) a female spotted dolphin; or an albino female spinner dolphin, or...
</div>

<div id='container'>
Hey arkon. I'll tell you why the runes look like they're from The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings. Thats because Tolkien used old viking runes, and changed what each runes letter truely was. Seeing as viking runes are litterally a dead language, barely anybody would be able to read that now. Tolkien based alot of his things on vikings, thats all that you must remember from now on ^^;; :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
sure

Yes, his is cool! But I love mine, too - in fact, I like most of the people's avatars. ^^

<div id='container'>
I have the hard cover of it somwhere, when It first came out.I saw the very short commercial for it, once or twice.  Just like I only saw one ecco comerical.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the rabid poster strikes again, I have a lot to say no?anyhow, class hasen't started yet, but does anyone Have any vidio files of the ecco commericals?Or can find them?  It would be great if wwe could get 'international' footage, the Japanese version, American, and so on.all i rerember is seeing the first one, some old fisherman was on a boat talking, the skys were grey.  At the end it labled the game as "it's like seeing through the eyes of a dolphin"the sequal, only see twice by my eyes had a fish in a bowl, and he was dreaming of ToT.and, for me thats it.  Unless Arky has some stashed away.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It works on most other programs i swear.  My version of animagic gif is 10 months overdue for crying out loud.  yet i still make animated gifs.  Hmm.

<div id='container'>
No the one on the site just doesn't work arkon.

Heh yeah eao that reminds me you cant let a cat sit on an inflatable couch unless he's declawed .
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
....no Eao  :? Man very few people are going to use the dolphidex.  They don't care what the animal does or is called in real life, they just care what it does in the, game, and maybe whether or not it can be blown up.  What we need is a game with a badass dolphin character who saves planets from really disgustingass bugs and shit.

I have the very interesting set up of a messed up clock. It only counts time while the computer is on, so therefore a 30-trial becomes a good four months, without any tampering. Also, my computer has difficulties with new programs and loads the defualts, so half the time it Jan. 1 of 1980. 
</div>

<div id='container'>
Secrets of the Deep is three books in one. The first one takes place in an underwater research station, which becomes captured by pirates. I have no idea what the second was about. And in the third...   is about some crazy guy. Maybe I should read it again. As I said, they are a bit sci-fi-ish, but they don't get to involved in that way, I think it's beacause the author wanted the main character to have a pet Risso's Dolphin. This book reminded me I grew up fascinated by dolphins. which I havn't forgotten about in the 3-4 years since reading it. Now I think I read more Sci-fi, because who's gonna write a serious book about dolphins? What about comedy. Comedy is good. In that case, anything by Douglas Adams. OK, so the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is Sci-fi, But there is also the Dirk Gently books, a parody of a detective. If you choose Dirk Gently, you may want to read  The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul Its faster paced than the other one and (if Tethys is watching) based on the Norse gods. Yes, all these books are wierd in their own, special way, but I needed something to entertain myself at the time.

Ok, some of you may have read Prelude to the Rising If you have, great. If you havn't... thats not so great but it dosn't matter yet. The Song of the Rising now consists of five books. The first is out side of the trilogy and has already been posted. The next two Me. Well, look at the avatar. Main character. Becoming bored with the life around him, decides to stay with his home pod to be with Verra.Verra Friend of Artreus. Highly active for a dolphin. She has two lines on her stomach that fan out at her tail. Balae Close friend to Artreus. Red flash above each eye. Gives the impression that he knows something is going on that the others don'tSurina Young dolphin, daughter of Twilight, follows around Surina.Orion Companion of Orion, Close friend of Artreus. Left the pod after Prelude to look for adventure, pod awaits her return.Twilight Deceased mother of Artreus. Nightsinger's death instilled a desire in Artreus to find adventure.Tsawa-Jest pod Friend of Artreus. Respects the dolphins, but remains loyal to his pod.Kuret Kuret's mate. Experienced Orca warrior. Padren Dominante Female of Tsawa-Jest pod. Sympathetic to the dolphin pod.Bay of Daybreak: Artreus' homebay. Usually referred to as the homebay.Describing any other characters, or more in depth description of current characters would result in the revealing of The Rising's plot.

I think I know how..... Awhile ago, when I was watching TV (hella bored before it came on the TV) I saw the commercial about the "Boat in the middle of the Sea". What happens in the commercial was this: Two guys on the boat are preparing to catch a fish, by throwing a lot of FISH BAIT made of a a lot of dead fish meat. After they threw the entire load of it, the camera shows the "Bait" slowly sinking down in the water. After that, one of the guys jumps from the boat in the water filled with dead fish bait... and that was it. After, it just showed the PS2 logo, console and the message "Wellcome to the third place".

Ack... Delphi and I went to see the Resident Evil movie last night... and I prayed to God for a long while that that movie wouldn't suck... looks like it was out of God's hands... it really sucked.Bad acting, crapy lines, awful costumes and not-to-par computer graphics.I'm not saying I expected it to be perfect, but with the popularity of the RE series, you'd think they could do better, that's all. I really wanted it to be good (but same with the FF movie, and look what I got   ) I've noticed that there has yet to be one good game movie in the recent out brake of them. And with more to come, I hope it'll get better (Max Payne, Duke Nukmen... and god no... Crazy Taxi). Learn from your mistakes people.The one movie that's to be coming up sometime that I REALLY, REALLY, don't want to suck is Silent Hill! If they could do it right, it would be scary as hell! *please, oh please, make Silent Hill a good movie...*Anyways... I just wanted to know what you all thought about the Resident Evil movie and/or all those other unfortunate vidoe game movies. I think it's an interesting topic to discuss (that maybe the people making these movies should hear), and you know, maybe I can do it right someday. ^^ Maybe.

Well, actually the names come from me peiceing letters together until they sound cool. Altough Spanish may have something to do with the way I spell them (Artreus, the e is pronounced like an a) Spanish is weird in that way. A= ah, E=A, I=E. As for the similarities between the Rising and Arkon's story, I guess great minds do think alike :D Well, the anti-dolphin Orcas are there to set up conflicts within the Orca pod, as well as others. Currently all thats posted is Prelude to the Rising so check it out. As for the rest, I'll probably finish part 2 soon, post what I have, and let a month go by before posting the conclusion, which now has a plot. Your input is appreciated.

Welcome to the clan, Kitnee and Artreus!Hm, isn't Artreus the name of the guy in the Myst games?  or something similar?  I can't remember, it's been forever since I've played them.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Those are cool!You should make some with the title graphics from the frist two games and one that looks like a level from the original game with sprites.  I would do it myself if I could.  Even if I knew how to make one, I'd still have to somehow find those images.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I wouldn't know, haven't played Myst before, but it wouldn't suprise me. Artreus is a lot like many names I've heard since coming up with it. It's not the first name I came up with for my character, but I like it the most.

Okay I read that thing and THAT'S exactly what I was thinking of when I said I heard somewhere where the name Ecco came from.  It was what he said about the combination of "Echo" and the Italian word for "I see".  I heard that somewhere, I just can't remember where.But that has nothing to do with the Project E.C.C.O. thing.  He only said that show was an inspiration for him, he didn't say it was an inspiration for Ecco.  And it's not where he got the name from.  So you can't say that the Project E.C.C.O. theory was close, because it has nothing to do with it at all whatsoever.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A lot of people are saying stuff about adding more characters. But I don't like the idea of choosing characters.  It doesn't work with the plot.  Ecco is supposed to be the one that saves the world, he's like the chosen one or whatever.  You couldn't have anyone else doing the same thing.  It wouldn't be right.On the other hand, now that I'm thinking about it, there is one way it could work.  If each character did something different, like they all take part in the whole saving the world thing, but in the end Ecco is still the big hero.  But I still don't know about it...It would be hard to make it so all the characters weren't pretty much the same.  Even if they weren't all dolphins, there's only so much they could do.  There would be no point to having a selection of characters unless each character could do something that the other characters couldn't do.In any case, no matter what I still don't think the addition of other playable characters is such a good idea.  It kinda messes up the whole idea.  Ecco is supposed to be alone.  Now you could have more characters that he interacts with throughout the game that help him in some way or another, I just don't it would work with a selection of playable characters.In my opinion, the best thing to do would be to make Ecco NOT like other games.  Make it unique.  When the original Ecco game came out, it was something that had never been done before.  Just the idea of playing as a dolphin was a unique idea, and having the setting underwater throughout the whole game, at least in a side-scrolling action game, was also unique.  So, I think that's the best thing to do, is to do something that has never been done before.

Do you? That one we played on the old YaBB board. Somebody would say an object, and then the next person would say something that had to do with that object and why.  ExampleBlood, because blood is red.Well, just to have alittle fun, let's revive that game, shall we? radio

That is pretty cool.The only complaint I have is the lion's feet look kinda funny. And...is he wearing a skirt?Well, I guess I really shouldn't say anything because it's still better than I could do.

A Wrinkle in Time was pretty weird, but good.  I would read the others in that series, but I don't know what order they go in.  Besides, those are really more the kind of thing you'd read in 3rd or 4th grade.One of my friends had to read Frankenstein for her english class.  She said it was really stupid.  She told me all about it, and it does sound pretty stupid.  It's nothing like the movie.I used to own 101 Dalmations, the original book.  It was pretty good.  And one of my favorite books was The Incredible Journey, the book that Homeward Bound is based off.  The book is much better, of course, and the animals don't talk.There were a few books I had to read for school that I liked, but I can't think of any of them, except the one I already mentioned.

Hmm. I was expecting RE to be a lot worse, actually. It's not like I'm exactly freaking out that I wasted my money on it. I wanted to see it. Unfortunately, it coulda been much better, too. With the actual characters from the games. They shoulda thrown Wesker in there just to shake it up a bit. But at least they didn't have any lines as bad as "Boo back" (God damned Queen of the Damned... UGH!)

I never played Resident Evil so I wasn't interested in the movie.  Same with Final Fantasy and Tomb Raider.The only other movies I've seen that were based off games were the Mario Brothers one and Mortal Kombat 1 &amp; 2.  I wanted to se Street Fighter, but I heard it sucked so I didn't see it.  The Mario Brothers one just wasn't very good at all.  But I actually liked the first Mortal Kombat.  Mortal Kombat 2 was okay, but they messed up a lot more stuff in that one then they did in the first one.Just from that, I think they should quit tryng to make movies based off video games.  It just doesn't seem to work very well.The one movie I'm looking forward to is Spider-Man.  The X-Men movie was really cool, even tho most hard-core fans of the comic were dissappointed by it.  But in my case, I watched the cartoon on Fox, and I've only read a few of the comic books.  The same goes for Spider-Man.  Anyway, I think the movie looks cool, and I figure if I liked the X-Men movie, I'll probably like the Spider-Man movie.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I always thought that might be fun, though I've never played Phantasy Star Online ;)Though I do agree with you, Tethys. Ecco is great the way it is, right? Why mess with something good? They always do that and it always winds up sucking...  :?

My Easter sucked, let's just leave it at that. &gt;_&lt; My grandma wouldn't come upstairs to eat with us at the table because she "couldn't walk." (She broke both her hips a little while back.)

YES!!! I want to see Spider-Man sooooo bad!!! It looks really cool! Spider-Man is my hero. Heh heh.But Tomb Raider had all and maybe more the hype that Spider-Man has, and we all saw how that turned out. Hopfully Spider-Man kicks ass!I liked X-Men a lot too, but I saw it way to many times in the same week, so now I'm sick of it.Oh yeah... Delphi, I could kind of disagree with what you said. Of the very little lines anyone did have in RE, some were pretty shity. "When I get out of this... I think I'm going to get laid." And oh yes, "You're going to have to work for your meal!" But otherwise, nobody really said enough to make a really stupid comment. "I've been a bad, bad little girl."   It was kind of interesting to watch, but there was no were near enough action then there should have been. And when there was, they avioded showing it. Go figure, eh?

Yay, something I can rant about.  (And if i get something wrong, I'm sure beaker will correct me later  )Okay, first glance errors.Flukes exceed peduncle(tail stock) bending limits of +-15 degrees arc off horizontal. Bending datum is spinal collumn just posterior of dorsal fin.Dorsal fin is located too far to the rear of the minor axis.Other things to consider is that the melon area seems thin. it should come to a more vertical ridge, right now its a bit effminate. Also the dorsal fin seems overly lunate (hooked) for a bottlenose, the trailing edge should probably have less curve, while the leading edge should probably be less straight though this part of a dolphin is definitly variable.Otherwise, pretty good job :)

Oh damn, too late, everybodies covered whats what XD So I'll just put a little bit of input.  I like the pose, looks like he's in a curious state, like he's figuring out a puzzle. His tail - looks perfectly fine to me, but you may wish to make the tips of the tail a little bit more pointedinstead of a direct loop. Some people may dissagree with this, but thats ok, as this is only my suggestions and input so heh )His body - Not too long, not too short, you've thickened him up in the right spot, unlike some other pro artists that I've seen whom make phins look.. wrong..  ) His beak looks a it wrong to me, I think you shouldn't curve the top jaw downward so much, so that you can make the lower jaw have that slight overlap at the front. His eye is possitioned nicely, and I like his smile D So things will be wrong here XD haha.~Whitefin

Delphi's got something there. When DoF came out, that's one of the first things I wished it had. What if after completing the game as Ecco, you had that kind of option for online play...? Servers (or like channels on an irc server) would be like Bays or Lagoons with a set number of residents that could work together to solve puzzles, or just screw around and do dolphin stuff...like jumpin' in and out of the water, harassing schools of fish, racing each other...that kinda stuff. Characters could be costomized; colors, species, abilities...that would be cool. And if Bays or Lagoons could take on the "feel" of particular areas or times in the game, that would kick ass! I'd be swimmin' around in a mankind's nightmare-like  part of the game for sure! That'd be SO cool....*sighs* But I'm just one hell of a dreamer aren't I? *giggles*

i hate to disagree with you tethys but if you read the email id say it was close. why? ever tried to contact the creator of ecco? if you had you would know he doesnt listen to nobody. and for okay reason, he has nothing to do with ecco anymore.but the email nonfish sent him got his attention, ed said himself the name ecco was something that popped in his head at the time but he learned later it meant in italian "I see" besides you got to give non fish a little credit. i don't see you finding answers to your questions? hehoh and stenellya you got to lighten up, how could people treat dolphins good when they can't treat themselves good? in sure those exparaments were done like that for a reason. also you got to note they were done along time ago and sometimes you got to make a sacrifice in the name of science.besides if you relly knew what john lillys exparaments where about youd understand why he did the things he did. but then again im not so sure of his exparements stenellya so i could be completly wrong. heh you could say his exparaments were failures and what he did to those dolphins resulted in nothing or maybe it did? fidning an answer isnt always done with the best technique and everyones got there own ways of doing things. maybe now you think it was bad and im sure john lilly would feel the same but back then im sure they didnt think of the possiblitys knor knew they were hurting an animal of equal intelegence to humans. i belive dolphins maybe be as smart if not smarter and if we communicated with them one day will give us answers to things we long wanted to know-where the fuck is atlantis?

<div id='container'>
heh an online ecco would be great, then i can beat the shit out of my enemys in my own way!although tethys your idea sounds great but ecco two had blackfin and tara, there was also trellia too. what would be wrong with playing as them?i still have to say though ecco 2 is the best ecco and always will be. even ecco the dolphin one for genesis/segacd was great. ecco dof just doesnt cut it too well as a great ecco game in my book. it just didnt have the elements that the other eccos had.one thing that dof lacked was interesting characters. in ecco two you went around the different levels talked to dolphins and they were always saying something interesting. but in dof they were just "blah blah blah" too much talk and story not enough adventure.ecco has always been a game of mystery, adventure, and fun/ ecco dof just reminded me of a bad episode of star trek, you know just too much story and beings who act like there so superior. i relly dont know but i liked dof but david brin just isnt s good as ed annuziatta - old eddy had a good touch when it came to ecco. hell he created ecco i relly wish he would hve responded to me about what he would have done if there was an ecco three.you know what im gonna trie to email him and ask. i relly want to know this!

ed actualy contacted me back but i admit i could have asked better questions, but he mentioned if there was a third ecco it would probably be about ecco and the atlanteans. again im not good at asking qustions but i got an answer to what owr true ecco three would have been about!I relly wish ed would have still been working on ecco cause he was just better at it then brin. but one day i hope to accomplish a third ecco of my own when my programming skills get better.----- Original Message -----From &lt;ed&gt;Sent28 PMSubject: Sequel to tides of time?&gt; Hey Ed,&gt;&gt; If you were still gonna do a third ecco the dolphin that would of been the&gt; sequeal to tides of time what would it of been about?The Atlanteans and Ecco in the distant past.I know at the end of&gt; ecco two tides of time there was a secreat password- what were your plans&gt; for what this password was suppose to do?The password had some information about how you played the Tides of timegame.  For example in the code the next game would know if you beat theTides of time and if you did it in Easy or Normal mode...  This info was tobe used to trigger thematic events in the 3rd game.  The basic idea was thatyou would SEE back into the tides of time...I'm sorry to ask but i relly want&gt; to know! after Ecco two came out i became a big fan and watched as the 32x&gt; ecco and saturn ecco's fell to the trash. there were so many answers i&gt; wondered about like how would ecco become free from being lost in a voidof&gt; time.He would swim in black seas of which he would never tell.&gt; what was the meaning to the vortex integrating with life on earth.The vortex queen escaped into Earth's past... way back...  She gave rise toexopods and arthropods... Ants, scorpions, roaches, crabs, lobster,spiders... all the children of the vortex.  These creatures or intertwinedand INTEGRATED in the biosphere of earth.&gt; what became of the atlanteans after the vortex destroyed them, i know they&gt; traveled into the past taking what they could.That is another story for another time to tell.&gt;&gt; and the final thing i relly wanted to know...how did the vortex queen use&gt; the time machine when "only reconized ones could travel through time" i&gt; figured ecco could because the atlanteans choose him.The time machine is a doorway in time.  A serious and dangerous mechanism.To prevent cross temporal infestations the machine was programmed to onlyopen for creatures who had specific genetic signatures.  The queen, moreclever than even the atlanteans realized, was able to sample Ecco's geneticcode during the final battle, and use it - Like a key.&gt;&gt; I would relly like to know the answer to these things please!&gt; ~Arkonviox&gt;&gt;

welcome to the forum delphieneus how did you find the website if you don't mind me asking?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*Hugging all the group* Ho, Swifty ! Niiiice to see you !
</div>

Hello again. I already answered arkons question through email, but I will do it again. It is based 500 years after ecco tot. Ecco has been trapped in the tides ever since, and the vortex have been gone. with most singers, Ecco and the vortex has become little more then a fairy tale amongst them, and the focus of the story begins with a very normal dolphin named Phosis, who wants nothing more then to have a peacful life, but ends up unlocking a horrible secret within the caverns of his home island. I will say no more about the fanfic, as I don't want to spoil it. Also, i emailed "Mr. Ed," The creator of Ecco, with a simple question. Was the level welcome to the machine based on the pink floyd song of the very same name? Here was his reply.I am a HUGE Floyed fan...    Yes you are correct.   Shine on you crazydiamond.This reply was not edited in anyway, and I was very excited to receive it. Perhaps this question has been answered before, I don't know. All I know is that I never found out, and was always curious. now, me, and anyone else who didn't know, knows. Thanks Ed!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That is really cool! i was going to make a story about the good future, where Vortex had integrated into the sea, so like there would be vortex creatures acting as predators and such, and I am glad that was cleared up! Ed is actually a real good guy. i contacted him once, as posted on another board, and he replied within a few hours. Good work Arkon, it is cool to have those q's cleared up!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I am new here also. it is a great forum it seems, and definitely a great site. Good Luck!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome! I am only like a day older then you here, so I know what it feels like to be an "Outcast"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
could you show us the replie? and what was the other board you contacted him from? was it an ecco site? was it ecco related? show us!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey stryker could you forward me the message you sent to ed. if its okay id like to add it to owr interesting things page! i also like to have original copys of the emails sent to him.Heh that was a good question i will admit. were pretty much cracking down on the secrets of ecco the dolphin.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome to the pod   :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome !!!!   D  D  D  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, I can do that. I will send it in your email!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i guess so.ecco needs sex appel, sex sells.how can we get people to be infatuated with a sea mammal?Sex appeal ? Hey, Ecco's a dolphin ! An animal can't be sexy !
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It was on this site, on the general board. But, it appears you already found it and moved it onto this board! Sorry about that, I figured general was an okay place for it. I will know better next time. Plus, I emailed you the entire message to analyze, rip apart, and place on your wonderful site! Enjoy!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was browsing the web, and I came across the following article.Ecco 2 is underway and headed for new waters. Read the first word on this amazing development.According to CVG, a sequel to Ecco the Dolphin//www.segaweb.com/news/0700/020.html
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aww! I like Whitefin's pic! Very cute! ^^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, welcome! Just don't become a one-timer like Eao said.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ask him about those mysterious Lord of the Rings type runes in City of Forever.

<div id='container'>
Hey, welcome to the forum. I was the new guy about a week ago, things change fast. Well, the best advice is to stick around. check out the forums regularly and try to get in on anything you feel you can talk about. When you feel you know the place well enough, maybe send something in for eveyone else to talk about. Confidence is the key, but there are a lot of great people that hang around here.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've seen them before! Ok, just the one on the right, but on someone's binder cover. I wouldn't have taken notice, but I saw your pic. This strikes me as odd, I've never seen the characters before, and then twice in a day.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i e-mailed ed and got answers to a few questions *dances hapily*----- Original Message -----From &lt;ed&gt;Sent17 PMSubject)&gt;&gt; 1) Where did you get the idea for trellia's form? I was looking intodolphin&gt; evolution and i saw that after the pre-dophins took to the ocean, they're&gt; fins got smaller and smaller &gt; and i was wondering if the idea from trellia came from actual reasearchinto&gt; cetean evolution, or was just an idea to make her look cool =)I imagined trellia as an angel.  an angel needs wings...&gt;&gt; 2) i've heard a lot about "ecco 3" the game never to be and i wondered if&gt; you had ever started a plot for it or anything. I know in origin bay how&gt; there are two glyphs located above the water that sayDOTF tie in with the genesis&gt; games?&gt;Sorry I didn't have anything to do with DOTF&gt; 3) in the newest ecco game, ecco&gt;&gt; "The Queen Makes Her Way To The Sunken City Of Atlantis. She Finds TheTime&gt; Machine And Escapes into Earth's Past. When The Queen Arrives In The&gt; Prehistoric era, She Encouters Creatures That She Cannot Rule.She Has No&gt; Choice But To Live Within The Life Cycles Of The Earth. And, Through The&gt; Eons, The Vortexkind Integrate With The Life On Earth."&gt;&gt; Could it be possible that the foe are an evoloved version of the vortex?I don't know anything about the foe.  The vortex queen escaped into Earth'spast... way back...  She gave rise toexopods and arthropods... Ants, scorpions, roaches, crabs, lobster,spiders... all the children of the vortex.  These creatures or intertwinedand INTEGRATED in the biosphere of earth.&gt;&gt; 4) this is one thing that paticularly caught my attention...&gt;&gt;http//www.dream-avenue.com/Other/Ecco/PelagosMF/FR_ecco.html)Hmmm, I don't know anything about this.&gt;&gt;&gt; anyways, hopefully thats not too much questions. Thank you for your timeand&gt; i hope you have some time to respond =)&gt;&gt; Sincerely,&gt; Liz 2e&gt;heh, well, i asked him about DOTF and i didnt know he didnt work on it   heh, but the most interesting thing was about trellia...hehe, the rest of the questions were sorta already answered =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Mooky!! I remember him well , yeah, he was joining the military service and as in Russia , for example , it`s 2 years long and absolutely compulsorylike Shadow said.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ecco and the atlanteans eh? that would have been awsome :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
man trellia those are pretty much all answers to questions ed has already answered. now hes probably gonna think of us al nusances. besides trellia whitefin beat you to some of those questions and you should have known that ed has nothing to do with DOF thats david brin.heh if its cool though id like to post it up in the interesting things. you answered one question i didn't. about trellias form.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the lion is female. a closer look on her body might help... :}Keepiru
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh...sorry arkon    yeah, go ahead and post itwell, i was surprised to get an answer at all, and he misunderstood my questions a bit *shrugs* it happens
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hullo!  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh yeah, I forgot about those lines    Yes, those were pretty bad. But nothing, NOTHING compares to 'Boo back', I don't care what anyone says

Hi it's me, that writer of that PS2 guide. Anyway I'm glad to be here, so uh hi! (Boy, I feel like crap I'm so ill. :( )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hello! good work on your guide so far
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
some things were americanized when they translated it
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey stryker don't worry where you post i just wanted to put it here because i knew more people would see it here. don't ever worry about which board you post in we will decide where it goes, so you don't have to. owr goal is to make sure its in a place where people will relly get to se eit.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
he didnt relly geive a big answer to mine thats why i propose we all gather to gether to think up some good ones.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
that was an answer i was told before. thats probably what those scriptures were for but i wonder what they ment and how to decode them. im sure they have some meaning. in the ecco game.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i've seent hat one before and a game like that should take at least a year to make and that was made a year ago er announced.hope it will happen and i hope the stories good for gods sake!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i added it in my interesting things page. i admit most of my sections will be revamped later thoughso we can get them in better order.even though some owr owr questions were super great i think we answered some good stuff with everyone else who contacted him.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
some people think so. besides eao what can you do thats so ex appealing? dolphins are already naked!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well here it is... my very first picture colored in Photoshop. VERY FIRST! Yippy! But no laughing, ok? I'm just a beginner! I don't know what I'm doing!!!And yeah, yeah... his body is all screwed up. I noticed that AFTER I outlined him. //beisick.dolphinparadise.net/albinodude.jpgWhat do you guys think? Any tips for Photoshop I could use?I realize, too, that there isn't much shading. I just didn't want to be too bold yet.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah your guide is relly well done. keep at it and don't give up it will be a great accomplishment when you finish it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
we won't see fargal for a long time but i figure one day when we least suspect it he will return.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Couldn't agree more. ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
enigma probably won't be released for a while but hopefully i can get the last pieces to the puzzle finished very very soon.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i leave it so people who just joined can post here. ofr some reason they like doing that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A big hello to Delphineus and Stryker! I'm sure you'll both fit in just fine! All I can say, is just get to know people.So welcome to the board!!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
sounds like a religious retreat... stop trying to pop-se-doose everyone.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
damn you should just make a "Where's Waldo?" rip off and give it up already
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Nah, the guy in Myst is named Atrus.Well I was close.Comon, Hist.  I don't see any reason to close this topic just because we got off-topic a couple times, and this time it was only a couple posts.  So far we've gotten back on topic each time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Doomtrain that sucks! why do post such shit in here! i mean come on. get your pop-se-doosing ass out of here you bastitch!REMIX!!!!!! D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe when I'm done with the guide it might be Version 10.6! (Because I only work on small parts at a time.  :| )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome!  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome, Crimson!  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I haven't read it because seeing as I have no PS2, it would be a waste of my time.  I don't use guides very much anyway.  Well...er...welcome to the forum! ^_^;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I never HAD any questions.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The only thing I noticed was that the head's too flat.  Not necessarily too small, but too flat. And the beak is too long.  Bottlenose's have shorter beaks than most dolphins.But, hey, it's still pretty good.   :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh! That's a SHIRT she has on under the jacket!  Er....Those lines are what confused me the most...But it still could look more feminine.  I thought the hair was a mane at first.Isn't the other character that raptor character you drew before in the first picture you posted?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, seeing as they don't make DC games anymore, if they do come out with a DotF sequal, it would obviously have to be on a different system.  And since the DC is the newest thing that I have (and I don't own a PS2) I won't be able to play it.  And I don't think I'll be getting another console any time soon.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The fanfic sounds cool.  I'll have to read it sometime when I have the chance.  Actually, there's lots of fanfics I would like to read when I have the chance...Could be a while before I get through them all, that is if I ever get around to reading any of them.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well Swift's idea sounds cool.  But I'd be missing out, because we have no place to connect another phone line and that's why I can't go online with my DC.  And even if I could I wouldn't be able to connect without tying up the line.  My mom has AOL connected thru her work, which is why I can be on AOL without having to worry about people not being able to call.I don't remember any character named Blackfin in any of the games.But, in any case, I still think it would kinda mess things up to have other playable characters, unless you just used them in side-levels or something.  Because otherwise it would kinda mess up the whole idea.  Ecco is supposed to be alone.Crap.  Now I forgot what else I was gonna say.  Oh well.Oh, I don't think this was what I wanted to say, but about sex appeal.  Plenty of games have done just fine without it.  Look at Sonic.  And Mario, well I suppose you could possibly count the Princess, but I wouldn't.  Of course, on the other hand, look how popular Tomb Raider was just because the main character was some sexy chick.  Well, I dunno.  I would just hope that most people don't play games just because it has sexy women (or men, but you don't see that very often in games).
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I noticed something on another site I go to. Its a section called "you know youve been playing star control too much when" And it was very funny. I thought it might be a good idea if sometime in the future it might be added in the humor section, and I think even if it isn't, it would be cool for you guys to contribute your own. If you dont know what I am talking about, here is some examples. You know youve been playing ecco too much when,You can understand that language written on the buildings in atlantisYou are afraid to swim in the ocean fearful that "Vortex might get you"You do a science report on the anatomy of the vortex queen in schoolYou can beat the entire game without losing a life, or using a passwordThis is just a few. I hope you will all contribute a little bit. I think it is a cool idea, and although mine werent very funny, Im sure some of you clever people will make good ones.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
 You can never play to much Ecco!But, for the sake of argument -You eat fish by smashing it with your nose,-You try to figure out where you are by whistling,-You keep an every vigilant eye out for shiny rocks to tell you what to do,-You built Atlantis out of mashed potatoes,-You glare at the constelation Pegasus, -You build a time machine in science class to find Ecco,-You write a report on the rise and fall of the Atlantean Empire,-You look for rings to jump through when you go on a boat trip,-You sleep with one eye open in your bathtub.Need I say more?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, I have another comment, but it doesn't have much to do with the picture.  I just wanted to mention there's a real organization called FIA.  I can't remember what it stands for.  I think it's a financial aid thing or something.  And they also have something to do with helping out families.  My sister deals with them a lot.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh those were pretty good! Thanks a lot, and keep em coming!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ahahaha! Dolphin's are already naked. Heh heh. That's funny.But I agree, that Ecco should have more characters. Different kinds of dolphins and stuff (like Delphi's cool dolphin characters ^_^). A create your own character would be cool too.A mini dolphin fighting game might be cool if they did it right. That's where you could use the character you created! Unlockable characters too... like Trellia and the Orca dude (can't remember his name).Oh, oh! How about a mini game featuring Trellia where you get to fly around and... do stuff. Collect things or something. That would be fun if you could fly around as Trellia.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Cooollllll..............that turned out great Doom'! *smacks Jader*I can't draw humans worth squat....He looks cute Doom', keep it up. ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I hope Jader's being sarcastic...Hey that looks really good!  I've been using photoshop for a few years now and I still haven't quite gotten the shading thing down.  His nose is kinda long...But at least you can draw a bow and arrow!  I can't draw bows, even tho they look like they should be easy.  But I can't get the curve right and I have a hard time making the string even and straight, even with a ruler.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's really cool that you got a hold of the creator of Ecco. Maybe he can get us some good inside juice in the future. I cleared up some good stuff too.Actually, just yesterday I sent a letter to EGM asking if they had any info on any Ecco news. I'm sure I wont get a reply, but it was worth a shot.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
They lay GREEN eggs?Uh, ostriches, bicause they look like emus.  And rheas.

Hey stryker! It's good to have a big poster around! Welcome to the board!I love your face pic too. It so cute! I don't know what the hell it is! But it's cute!  8)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
About the whole pink floyd thing...many of you probably havent read this, but I spoke to ed about that, and he said that the machine levels name was inspired by Pink floyd, because he is a big fan. Just thought it would be appropriate to repost.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Holy moly! Out break of fanficts! It's crazy! How am I ever going to find time to read them all?Oh well... I did say I was looking for stuff to read.  8) Look's like I found it.Your fanfare must have really worked good Arkon. It's an epidemic!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i doubt it doomtrain ed doesnt even know what ecco defender of the futures about because he had nothing to do with it.he quit appaloosa along time ago. but he was ecco's creator, dabid brins responcible for ecco now or anyone who appaloosa choose to write the stories.ed's a geneneus when it coems to ecco though, thats something the new eccos can't capture but...perhalps they will trie
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey with all these talented people gathering we won't have to worry about psybadit.and you should read the prelude to strykers storie!the best part is his section is the first to use enigma!!!!httpstryker89fantasticblueenigmas customize feature will be disabled for a while until enigmas fully complete. the whole website has to be converted to enigma htmlanyhow happy reading!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
we kinda knew about this before but we never dared asked ed since he "used" to be hard to contact.

<div id='container'>
*ahem*Jader Thanks Swift! For the compliments... and for smaking Jader. ^_- Glad you like it!Tethys: Yeah... the guys whole body is messed up. Face encluded. Of course I noticed after I outlined him. WHY DO YOU ALWAYS NOTICE AFTER?!?!?!?!? ARGHHHH!!!! *smashes keyboard all over the room* Ah shyit... I've been rushing too much I think... I just want to finish pictures so I can color them! I'll have to slow down and looks for these details that I always mess on.

it's about summer time, around this time people are getting out of school and stuff. then we get alot of newer people!summer i suppose is owr busiyest time yet!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah Wrinkle in Time is a super low reading level, but it's still a good quick read. And as for the sequals, the go: "A  Wind in the Door", "A Swiftly Tilting Planet", then "Many Waters". ^_-  8)I'm reading a book now called "The Midwich Cukoos". It's actually pretty interesting from what I've read so far. Weird of course, just like all of John Wynhames books... but interesting none the less. I actually have now become a fan of his writing. I like his themes I guess.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow, this is certainly exciting! My fanfic made it into the fold! It is sure an incentive to work on it some more....and better yet, its the first place enigma is used! I will be writing a lot to add more to my fanfic, thanks a lot Arkon!

That picture is off the back of the Japanese Ecco the Dolphin Mega CD manual. My friend James found a copy of it, and being a collector of Sonic and Ecco things, he just had to get to ^^) And they're really cute :) I'll upload them one day and show you guys.

Heheh, thanks. actually, it is a sprite from a very old DOS game none of you have heard of called Star Control 2. And yes, it is cute, now that I think about it..

Ask him why he used Viking runes in the Atlantis levels, if they mean anything, and why he scrapped the original Dark Future from the Beta.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Used being the key word there Arkon *huggles the original e-mail she got from Ed all those years back* I think that perhaps the runes may talk of the destruction of atlantis, how it was sunk by a great caticlysim that sunk it beneath the sea (in the Ecco story, it was a beam from the heavens, a nice big lazer blast from the Vortex o.o;). Or perhaps about the war with them. Its a question that needs to be asked. who knows, they ay just be there for decoration^^;

Well i hope they make a new ecco game.  I'd love to try it.  I wish they would hurry up and make one for crying out loud.  Only problem is i'll be going to college hopefully in a years time and i don't have a ps2.   :(
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
happy birthday vantid im surprised i didn't see you on the net at all? were you playing hooky from school?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hi
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I find it helps to give your modem a name, so you can have something to scream at it other then Supid Modem. ....mine is named Mr. Sulu. Warp speed!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I first thought it was that damned little ET.  8O Anyways, hi.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yup, nice guide. I looked at it despite the fact that I do not own a PS2, and probably never will. =)*goes right back to playing his gamecube :D*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
where the hell are all these new people coming from? aroo and welcome!!! im the local polywere extraordinare. so...why are you gonna eb mailing e'ryone?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
how do ya make those skins? those are REALLY great!!!! not keen on the earth clan one but the others are awesome!!!! yay yay yay.one q....is this gonna effect how i do my tutorial? hell...im still using the old template. oO
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it won't effect your section since i will just fix and messups in it myself.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
man trelluis it's already bad enough your a rare face but its cool just make sure to come back when everything gets straightened out.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
 I think a cool edition to Ecco would be if there were an option to have a character to help you (more than usual) if you are badly stuck in a level.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey, Doomy, please don't tell me you're dissing the Tomb Raider movie?! I thought that was excellent! *sighs and shakes head*And Mortal Kombat was a good movie! And there's bound to be another out there that's good and based on a video game!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Of course! But then again, did we ever make any sense?! &gt;P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I got my art exam tomorrow. Having already endured a gruelling five hours of it, I have another five to look forward to tomorrow... Wish me luck  :? The sooner this is over the better......
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Exams are a pain, It doesn't matter how good or bad you were in school, everyone has to worry about the exam, Altough in my case its usually because I forgot what I learned by the time the exam rolls around 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ok, some of you may have heard that the guy who wrote the story line behind DotF was David Brin, and maybe that it was because he wrote the book Startide Rising. What you may not have heard is thats its being made into a movie. Now, other than Flipper, I can't even think of a movie based on dolphins. I've heard that Paramount bought the movie rights for it, but I haven't heard anything since. Has anyone here heard about what's going on, or at least know what I'm talking about?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
:D Hey, welcome aboard, stick around for awhile.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yup, it's the invasion of the new guys... and I lead them   That was what? a week ago? Well, in the words of my soon to be posted fanfic:"Let him stay, he adds a new voice to our wisdom" -so stick around.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, I would say the best way to go is to make yourself known to the forum, but it looks like you've done that already....In that case don't burn out and welcome
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Update Ancient's Call- will be sent to Arkon today.Part2 Trianna's Future- is done and will be posted when I'm about half way done with Part3.Part3: Final Confrontation- ideas are laid out with a plot that fits the story line, will begin real work on it as soon as Part2 is done.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks a lot everyone!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hi. I wrote a fanfic prelude called The fantastic blue, and I was just wondering if anyone has read it? I know the main link on the news page hasn't worked yet, at least not for me. If you have, I would really like an opinion! Any comments, Good, or horribly awful would be nice, because I need to know how I can improve on my writing skills. Thanks a lot!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Damn straight!  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Mr. Sulu? I'd rather name mine Scottie!!  :D My old modem got hit by lightning once, too. Not a fun experience. &gt;_&lt; No internet and forums make Kitnee something-something.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aaaaaah , finally you are here...i am also a little bit out...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This little out-let and power bar, underneath this desk... are my life blood. If I lost my computer... I would die....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Amen, Doomy....amen.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Scotland you say? That's cool! I don't think we have a Scott around here, do we?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I don't think so, Doomy...then again I haven't been here in a while, so who knows?  :? Scotland...I always wanted to go there. ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Same here... I can't remember all that stuff they taught me WAY back in the beginning! Sheesh!But I've never had an art exam before. What do you have to do for it? Well, whatever it is... best of luck, Tide!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I liked Tomb Raider to some extent. I thought the Lara Croft in the movie was very cool, but I can't stand the video game character. It would have been better if there was more action in it, like The Mummy, you know? I mean, one of the biggest fight senses in it was full of bad guys that were slower then molasses. It also had a really loser villian, then put in this huge cast of no-names with Jolie. I'm sure they could have afforded more.Don't get me wrong... I liked the movie (I bought it, didn't I?), I just think they could have done much better. It DID beat Resident Evil though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Happy birthday Vantid!!!I hope you had a great one too! You're almost at your year too! Gad damn, I can't wait until my year. I'm going to go nutz that year! Whoo-whoooooo!!!! And Delphi, you're coming with me! ^_^Happy b-day!

Anyone that has a modem still and happens to live in a place that has above ground phone lines still should invest in a phone line lightning arestor. Little $5 part saves you the cost of a new modem.

Its good so far, You've developed the idea's behind Phosis' mind, this is important because the reader has no idea how a character thinks unless the author tells them. One thing to keep in mind is to re-read it when you're done, simple mistakes are easy to see. This being a casual story its not as important, but I've been trained to notice these things.   It sets up the plot well for the continuation of the story, and leaves off at an unfinished point of the story, kind of a hook into the next. Being the first part of a story it's purpose is to develop the main idea and characters, and I think you did that. Another thing I suggest is to read some of the other works already here and see for yourself what works and what doesn't. Hope I've helped, and keep at it.

Hello all of you wonderful, woderful cetaceans! Its me Sonar. I just wanted to say hi and add another subject for yall to write on. I dont care what ya say but just don't      the moderators off!     *side note* how the hell do I get my avatar picture to work!

<div id='container'>
ahhhh! ecco is sooooo cute! hehe =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Romance novels! HA HA HAH!!! *dies* 8O Anyway... umm... yeah. I was named after a song sung my Barry Manilow. *hums* Speaking of the Redwall books (Doomtrain mentioned it earlier), I'm not so fond of those anymore. They've become rather repetitive and in some places (dare I say it?) slightly stupid. Books like "Tailchaser's Song", "Silverwing" and "Sunwing" are the kind of animal fantasy I like now... reading a new one called "The Golden Cat". Wonder how this one'll come out...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tomb Raider. Oh Jesus, don't get me started. That movie was crap. A total waste of time and energy, if you ask me. And I said, IF YOU ASK ME. Leave me alone with my opinion.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
indeed! happy late b-day vanny =)

A more lighthearted, excellent series of fantasy novel is the discworld series. (Over 26 books. Yeesh!) It is my favorite series, by far, and I strongly suggest anyone, who likes any genre of book to give it a try.

<br />

<div id='container'>

i will be honest with you guys i havent relly read any story yet. mroe like skimmed through them. I have to say though stryker you got an interesting story and you know something guys, i relly want to read all the new fanficts! they look relly relly awesome.ANother note too is i wish i could get back to work on my story, but if your itnerested check it out here http://arkonviox.com/projectarkon/index.htmlthat section has collected alot of dust, its actualy planned to be a game! its just i have too many projects more then i can handle. but you know something i want to tell you another story.along time ago back in 1997 all i ever wanted was a place to find ecco fan ficts, and artwork and what all. one day i found it in the year 2000 it was called the undercaves and was truly the first ecco website. A little afterwords i opened Arkonviox.com and the undecaves was handed to me and i closed it since handling two websites was hard. i tried but it was hard. so i combined it with arkonviox.comhistory lessons over but thought i should tell you, i rmemeber when w edidnt have nothing, so im greatful we got writers, artists, (fans of ecco ) this is what it should be like!

We don't get ours till end of June, either, plus ours are only focused on what we've learned the second half of the year. D).  In the middle of each one, we get a thing called an interim - it basically shows our progress up to when we get them.  At the end of each marking period, we get report cards.  At the end of the second marking period, we got midterms (mini finals to test your knowledge of what you've learned thus far), and at the end of the fourth we get finals.

The whole New York system is being re-done. It works the same as Kitnee's, without the interim. Although I have some finals in the middle of May. Well, they are changing all the standards so you can't get a low grade on say, the English exam. But they made it so it's near impossible to do great on it anyway. It is my opinion that they just don't want to figure out how good everyone is, just mash 'em in the middle. No one likes the new standards, and the only people who actually understand them are the old guys rewriting them.

It would be great to have cable or DSL (I have no clue what the difference is between those two).  But then AOL might not be compatible--well, I could still use AIM to chat with my buddies so that would be no big deal.  But, I'll worry about that if I ever get something like that.

now we have two blue stripy dolphins...Yeah, seems we do! Hi there Artreus! I be Tidesinger, (if you couldn't tell from the bit on the left) and my avatar will tell you the rest!But what I'm posting for is to say that I meant to post yesterday. I just wanted to say that the art exam finished on Wednesday (thank god) and so I'm now free from exams until the 7th of May (day after my birthday... How shitty is that?  :( ), because then I have my German oral exam!I swear I'm gonna have no finger-nails left by the end of May....

Well, while you have a mere two blue strips, I have four  The first exam I have to worry about is May 10 you're from the UK, thats part of Europe right?) My vote of confidence?

About it being online. I think this is a great idea, and character design and select appeals to me even more. And as for Ecco being the hero, who cares? I mean, on Sonice Adventure (note SONIC) you can play as all the other characters. I don't see why it should be such a big deal if they did this for Ecco.

<br />

It'd be cool if you could form clans and pods. and defend your home bay and such, pod wars and that

In my opinion, I think ps2 sucks, and I will probably never buy another console. I have 25 DC games, and since I only play unreal tourney, It isn't too much of a problem. After beating ecco DOTF, there isnt much point to go back, except to say your the best, and get all the vitalits, but no one I know would really care, so I wouldnt be able to show them off.  :P

<br />

<div id='container'>
Taking something away from an image and fully repairing it to it's original state is very, VERY damn well hard.Well I didn't say it was easy, I was just saying it's possible.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
delphineus, Would you happen to have the large version of the photo that you use as your avatar? I almost feel like I recognize the dolphin but its too small to make out identifing marks.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well it was just that from your first message I kinda got the idea you already knew some people here or something.Eventually I might get around to reading your fic.  There's a lot that I want to read--actually I want to read all of them, but I haven't read any that haven't been posted in this forum yet.  The problem is that by the time I get done doing everything I want to do each day, I don't have much time for reading fanfics or anything.  And when I do, I don't think about it.  Even if I printed them out, I'd still have to wait till I get a decent chance to read them.Oy, I make it sound like I'm so busy all the time.  Maybe some time when I have no homework, I should just take time to read a fic and put off whatever else I want to do until later.

Well if all the characters had different things they had to do, so long as Ecco continued to be the major character, that would be fine.  But it would be pointless to have multiple characters if they weren't all unique.  If they're all dolphins and whales, they'd all be basically the same.  They'd have the same moves and the same controls and everything.  They would all have to each have something that the other characters don't have, that would make each character unique.  But what could you possibly do with dolphins and whales?  Ecco doesn't have any special powers, really, except some gained by accomplishing different tasks or finding certain objects or like the power the Asterite gave him.  But, for the msot part, he's an ordinary dolphin.  So it wouldn't be right to have other characters that have special powers or anything.  And other than that, there isn't really anything you could do to make them unique.  Even if you had characters that weren't dolphins or whales, a lot of animalswould still be very similar, and most sea animals would have even less capabilities.  And you guys are saying it should be like other games.  It should be like this game, it should be like that game.  I say once again Ecco should be unique!  You could make it like every other game out there, but I beleive uniqueness would appeal more.  Of course, it can sometimes be a bad thing, but if you do it right and it works well, that is much better than having a game that's just a copy of a bunch of other games.  Unfortunately, we see that way too much in the gaming industry these days.  We need something more creative.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
When you find a locked door, you run around the house trying to find a "key glyph."When you have a test in Biology, you label the DNA strand as "Asterite".You warn all your friends to swim slowly past Eight-Arms.You have a pet goldfish (or any pet at all) named Ecco.And...that's all I can come up with. I'm not good at this sort of thing.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, one more:You argue over where Ecco's name came from (and you actually care!).
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
delphineus, Would you happen to have the large version of the photo that you use as your avatar? I almost feel like I recognize the dolphin but its too small to make out identifing marks.Identifying marks? Dolphins have marks?  They all look exactly the same to me.Well I like the avatar, Delphineus.  And yours too, Artreus.

*points to ur sig* anything is possible, eh? ;) howabout spontanius human conbustion! @.o or digging to the center of the earth!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, I have one!  Okay it's a dumb question and I doubt anyone really cares.  But since we know where Ecco's name came from, what does Trellia mean?  Oh, and what about Tara and Kitnee?  Well, Tara is an actual name, I know that much.  It seems weird that a dolphin should have a human name.Oh, I just thought of something else.  I have no clue where it actually says the names of Tara and Kitnee.  In fact, I don't even know where Tara appears, and I only assume Kitnee is the same orca that always appears here and there to give Ecco some advice.  But they are both in Ecco Jr.  And although I never owned it, I remember clearly (plus I have an old picture that I drew with the names) that in Ecco Jr.  Kitnee was a dolphin and Tara was an Orca.  So, I'm wondering what the deal is with the name switch.  Was it just a mistake that never got fixed?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Identifying marks? Dolphins have marks?  They all look exactly the same to me.Yep. How else do you think you tell em apart ;) Generally the dorsal fins are a pretty good way to tell small dolphins apart, and baring that, the pattern of scaring and sometimes even color. Orcas are easier because you've got the eyepatch and mouthchip to help out.

All right, here's my thinking: When I complete Song of the Rising, who would be interested in me writing a fanfic based on Ecco 1 and 2 from Genesis? It's an idea I've had that just doesn't seem to want to go away. I can think of reasons why not to do it, and reasons to go ahead and write it anyway, so I guess it depends if there is any interest in seeing it done.

What kind of school actually gives you a scholarship if you pass exams?  I assume that's what you meant when you said you save money on college.Here we have 2 semesters, each with three 6-week amrking periods.  We have an exam at the end of each semester.  The final exams are on the last week of school, which is really just three half-days, with two exams each day that last two hours (those that have a 7th hour have three exams the first day).But Seniors don't take final exams!     But I'm still not free because I know I'll have to take exams in college.

<div id='container'>
All right, I've found something//home.hiwaay.net/~ssloan/brinl/srmovie.htmlSome points I pulled out NOTE The "Startide Rising" movie (if it gets made, which at the point cannot be certain) will be a high profile, high budget live action film. Figures of $100 - $200 million have been suggested to me as a budget. Mace Neufeld, the Producer, is a seasoned filmmaker with a lot of clout -- his credits include all the Tom Clancy movies ("Hunt ...", "Patriot Games", "Clear ...") and the upcoming John Travolta vehicle "The General's Daughter". Tom Hanks has been suggested as the top contender for the lead role of Tom Orley. Directors such as Ron Howard, Luc Besson, even Jim Cameron will be offered the project for consideration. The Dolphins will be a state-of-the-art blend of live dolphins and CGI, pushing the limits of special effects. The tone we're going for is a combination of "Star Wars", "The Abyss", "The Fifth Element" (visuals only), and something that has never been seen before. If this movie gets made, it will be big. -What worries me is the're still not even sure thay will do it, which is a shame because I thought Startide Rising was a great book, and we need a better dolphin movie than Flipper.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was thinking of the same thing, But I think there is too much stuff in the games, and you would have to know EVERYTHING, which is why I think you would need to get a lot of opinions and ideas first. Plus, there is a lot of parts in the game with no story, where you are just swimming around, and there is not a whole lot of dialogue, so I think you would need to add a lot of things to it as well, maybe expand on the story itself just a tad. If you need any help, I would be more then happy. I have a love for writing and Ecco, and that idea had always been with me as well, I just never have sat down, and laid out all the ideas, into how it would make a good story, written.

Yes, Kitnee is the dolphin of Ecco Jr.; no name changes between the two. I just use Kitnee 'cause it sounds more "Eccoish" than Tara.

Euro History is an AP course, so taking it in high school means I wouldn't have to pay money to take the course or exam in college, and it makes me look better if I do well in it. I was kinda vague on that. Money was given to the school to be given to graduating students, but its detracted from student loans or something, so we never see it. Well, this being a college exam, its in May, all the other final exams are in June. The whole last week is devoted to them. Days are divided in halfD Problem is, they do about 4 exams in each time slot and during the mid-terms (final exams halfway through the year) I had to do my Euro and Bio tests at the same time.  like half the seniors in my health class.

i have become increasingly jealous of all the damn cool dolphin personas you guys have developed, and I want to make my own. I dislike my very generic Stryker89 name, (used in collaberation with my nick from various online games) And want to make my own dolphin persona thing. I was wondering where i could find good pics of dolphins, good sprites, and if adobe photoshop 6 is a good tool for messin em up? also, is it very hard to make a new ident? Can I simply change the name, or do i have to make a new account? Thanks!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
All, good points. I have the roms, and level skip codes, so moving through the boring levels won't be a problem. As for adding more to the plot, such as side stories, that might work. But, I wouldn't want to go too far off. Any helpful ideas or contributions to this project can be sent to me at AJ@Arkonviox.com Oh, and any points you want to make sure I get to you should mention also. But don't get too excited yet, I still have to finish Song of the Rising, and get the main ideas of each Ecco level. One more road block: I kinda liked ToT better than Ecco 1, and I don't want to rush through the one just to get to the other. Well, anyway, I'll probably do it, but it would take some time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, Since you are busy with the song of the rising, and like tot better, you could write tot, and I could do ecco 1 if you would like. I Hav always had a special place for ecco one. It scared the hell outta me when I was seven (The vortex head is still genuinely frightening) And I would love to do it. I have tons of free time, and that way you could go on to do TOT since you like it better anyways. Is this a good idea? You can email me at stryker_89@hotmail.com or just post the reply here.

Heh heh. Thanks! Yup it's my first. And guess what everyone!!! I'm getting my tablet on tuesday!!! Yippy!

I'll keep an eye out for any base pictures to use. Mine was a picture scanned onto my computer, then changed a bit and converted to a modifiable format with polyview, then back to the smaller .jpg format using the same program. As for changing your user name... you'll have to talk to Arkon. unless it can be changed just by clickingon that profile tab next to the login/logout tab up top. If you try that, you may need to confirm your password. I've never tried it before, and can't garauntee anything.

I've had that for ages and you just noticed it? o.o;Well, spontaneus human combustion could be possible.And you could dig to the center of the Earth with the right tools, like if you had something that could dig thru rock, and if you wore a heat/magma-proof suit, because otherwise you'd die before you ever got there.You see, the point is that even those things that may seem impossible now could be possible in the future if someone invents a way to do it.  Just think at all the things we can do now that people used to think were impossible, such as going to the moon and flying (well, in a big machine, but hey) and...cloning. And a whole bunch of other stuff. So it's supposed to be inspirational.  "Anything is possible" is my own personal quote because I truly beleive it.  Well, most of the time.Ahem....but, maybe we should get back on topic...

Yes, Kitnee is the dolphin of Ecco Jr.; no name changes between the two. I just use Kitnee 'cause it sounds more "Eccoish" than Tara.  Yeah, but, somebody said before that in one of the other games there's a dolphin named Tara and that the Orca is named Kitnee.

Reading Tidesinger's original message again---How can you have an art exam?  I never had an exam or a test in art, I don't see how you can be tested on something like that. The only thing I can think of is it might include terms that you learned or something. But other than that it's not like you really learn anything in art, except maybe new techniques, but it would still be hard to write a test based on that.  of course, my art teacher doesn't even tell us how to do anything.  It's just like "The clay's over there.  Make a sculpture" or "Here's some watercolors and a brush. Paint something."  The teacher I had last year at least showed us how to do things (and if you asked her for help, she'd practicallydo half of it for you   :P  ).

I've asked about the shadow whale before, if you'd care to actually read the e-mail I got o.o;; He didn't know what it was, so that obviously means that it was a glitch. But Yes, I agree with Eao, why, the name, etc.. things about the Asterite XD

If you have a Tripod account, you can use Trellix, but it sucks.I used to have Homestead, which was great, but they started charging.  You know, I think that my account is still active, even tho sometime last year I requested to have it removed.I would suggest FrontPage.  Just like the other two I mentioned, you don't need to know html to use it.  And it works just like a word processor. It's really easy. I just got done doing a tutorial on it for my Personal Computing class, and I'm planning on using it for my web site now, when I actually get around to doing anything with it, that is.You have to find something that's compaitble with FrontPage, but that shouldn't be too hard.  I don't think there's much that isn't compatible with it.There's also Publisher, but I don't know anything about it.

Is anyone else having crazy weather?  Okay, the temp's been up and down all year.  It's either unseasonably warm or unseasonably cold.  And ever since Spring was supposed to start, well we had two days of summer and now it's winter again, we skipped spring and fall. But the temperature is still going up and down.  Last week we had one day when it was about 86, and the next day it was about 93.  The day after that it was in the 50's.  A couple days ago, we had rain, snow, sleet, and sunshine all in one day.  Michigan weather is normally messed up, but this year it's at an extreme.In a normal year, the winter will be in 10s and 20's, or below, tho the past several years it's been warmer, spring will start in the 50's and 60's and end up in the 70's and lower 80's, summer will be in the 80's and 90's and in the past it's even gotten past 100, fall would be like spring except reversed.  This winter it would be in the 50's one week and in the 10's or 20's below.  And I already described our spring so far. Chances are it's gonna be like this all year.So, there, I'm done griping now.

My sis just turned 19 on April 2nd, and she's been in college since September. It all depends on when your birthday falls. Mine is July 5th, and I'm going to be 17. So when I get out of high school next year, I'm still going to be 17.  When I start college, I'll be 18.

I'm getting the same weather Tethys gets, it just crosses the great lakes and picks up some stuff first. We didn't get any snow until late December this year, unusual in that it usually starts in October. It hardly snowed until school let out for winter break, then we got a few feet. And I get to shovel the driveway. x_x Had to do it a few times some days. Roads always seemed to be plowed every day before school started, and they let the kids who walk freeze on the way. At the moment, we're just barely above freezing. A couple warm days about two weeks ago, but we were still getting snow until last week.

Well...C is 100, L is....I forget....X is 10 so XXX is 30, and I is 1 so III is 3...I guess then L must be 50.Boy am I good at this deductive reasoning stuff or what!  :P Well that is assuming you're right that it's 183.And actually you don't have to be royalty to have a name liek that.  If your grandfather is Joe, and your dad is Joe Jr. than you would be Joe III, if you're named after your dad and grandpa.  Or, if your grandpa is Bill, and your dad is Ted, and then you're named after your grandpa, you could be Bill II.For some reason they just don't seem to do that with girls' names.Well, actually, I once heard some word that's used for the third that's like junior, but I forgot what it is and it's not used much.  Well, then you could still have Joe IV.

Well, we had snow late in January, but it usually starts late October.  But we did have a couple good storms, and by some miracle we got one snow day this year, the first one in about three years. We used to get a couple every year.  But most of the time it was a warm winter.  Then it snowed a lot towards the end of March.  It's like the seasons are reversed.im from california and a summer here usualy sucks ass. well were im from anyways. its always cloudy and too cold to o swimming.Cold in California? o.o;  What do you consider cold there??Well, maybe in the northern part...My weather's been odd, too.  Doesn't this have something to do with global warming?  Actually I think it's another El Nino.  That's what my dad's been saying, anyway.  Global warming is just the overall climate getting warmer over a period of several years.  It has nothing to do with the roller coaster weather we've been having lately.

You know I didn't even THINK about the Asterite when I was thinking of names.How about why does it look like a giant DNA strand?  And how come in Asterite's Cave in ToT is it gold, but in the levels where you find his globes, and in Ecco 1, they're all different colors?The name Vortex kinda makes senseA vortex is like a whirlpool, which sucks things up into it.  And the Vortex kinda sucks life out of the sea.Aw, heck, let's just ask him where all the names came from, except those that are obviouse, like Blackfin (even tho I still have no clue where he appears in the games).

Sorry guys, ive been kinda a lazy bastard who's been busy with stuff outsdide of the internet that i forgot about a project for you guys i promissed thats long overdue.But  Its a go, one more time.Im revamping the All in the family storyline, it will be a flash-based series.Im rewritting the story. In addition, im also workign on all in the family's very own website that will feature concept art, scripts, proilkes and more.All in the family also has added charicters. IM not gunna name them all, but one: Histronic.I had to re draw the charicters and make them more animated. The old ones only had moving jaws, so now the charicters can do more actions. Im currently workign on the episode. It maybe slow progress with the restart, but i promise you it'll be worth it.Also, Episode 3 of the series will feature the voice of the real Yogoat. And, if i can talk him into it, Alastor doing his own voice. But thats for Episode 3 (Grand Theft Yogoat)The reason i decided to do it over was becuz i had it bas3ed in North Carolina, and i have no fuckign idea of what places are there besides Charlotte. So the new All in the family story is based in San Francisco and the Bay Area.In addition, the story where Yogoat loses his possesions in a dice game was scratched. He's now a comedian who losses his job when he decides to quit his job at a comic theater and has his possesions taken from him, and some added things that im sure you'll be happy with.And again, im sorry for procrastinating on it for so long. But its a go this time!

i got this from a friendAs you may be aware, the hijackers in the Sept. 11th attack were told thatthey were being sent to an eternal reward that included being serviced by 72virgins.One of the hijackers went to his reward, and was greeted by GeorgeWashington, who proceeded to beat him to a bloody pulp. In a great deal ofpain, he managed to drag himself off to a corner and, after a few days,was able to gingerly get to his feet again. He had taken no more than afew steps when he was confronted by Thomas Jefferson, who without a singleword commenced to take up where George Washington had left off, leavinghim a broken mess on the ground. Once again, he dragged himself away tonurse his wounds and whimper in the corner. Again, after several days, hewas able to drag himself to his feet... and ran into Robert E. Lee. Leepistol-whipped him, cracking his skull and breaking his nose and jaw. Asthe hijacker lay there on the ground, looking up at Robert E. Lee, hemoaned through his broken teeth: "Why, Allah? When do I receive myreward?".Robert E. Lee bent over him and snarled, "This _is_ your reward, boy, andyou have 69 more pissed-off _Virginians_ to go before we start all overagain!"

Writing in my Fic has been rather sporadic. I wrote the first few passages a good two months before continuing. There is now (for me) a mental wall about halfway through the third passage. I type it on MS Works on my computer, but I often write it out by hand first in school when I have nothing nicer to do, and then expand on it when I put it on my computer. Its easier when its in front of you, not on a computer screen. Its easier to pick out any bugs. Printing it out several times becomes costly though. I printed out what I had before my trip to Florida to work on it down there. When I got back up and printed it again. The first time it was barely 5 pages long. The second it was a good 14. It allowed me to find tons of changes though, maybe taking off a whole page of needless information. I prefer to type it though, I've had horrible handwriting all my lifeoops:

I try to read as many as I can, to avoid writing something like anyone else's. Most of them aren't too long, I'm afraid mine is becoming kind of lenghty though. They all are done differently too. I try to have muliple perspectives in mine, and in others you stick with the main character. They are all good, but some are vague in the environment they are set in, and need more description. Of course, many books have been written with page long descriptions that put the reader to sleep.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Phosis and I are already sharing information on what's going to be done. As we are both writing are own stories though, I can't say for sure when we'll get started. As for any suggestions, just send them in. The games are somewhat lenghty, and as necessary, some points will need to be dropped, but some additions may be made also. This should be well... interesting.

This is because A Too many people add a lens flare but fail to add a backlight to the scene to generate the flare. As a photographer I know that you have to be at the critical angle to a bright light source at the width angle of the camera lens to get a flare. C Having lens flares in your photos isn't dramatic, its a mistake in scene composition, and because you're shooting into a light, you have an exposure error as well.Tip: Don't use lens flares where normal point light sources would work, and if all else fails, use cone lights.

I use lens flare sometimes to make things look shiny, but I make it real small.  Photoshop has three different kinds of lens flares, and one is supposed to look like the flash of a camera reflecting off something, which is what I use most often.  But I try to do it so it just makes something look shiny, and I don't put a bunch of lens flares all over the place.  And you don't need to have a light on the picture.  The light source can be off to the side somewhere, where you can't see it in the picture.  And you can have more than one light source.  You just gotta make sure to be consistant.

Man, I was in the middle of typing a response when AOL logged off.  Then when I signed back on and went back here and tried to respond again, I had to reload...Ahem....Anyway, it's pretty cool.  I really like the shading.But, I don't think she should have webbed hands.  Webbed feet is something amphibians and waterfowl have.  The only mammals that have webbed feet are platypi (that's the plural form of platypus) and fishing cats (yes, a wild cat with webbed feet that swims underwater).  There may be a few others that I'm unaware of, but that's the exception, not the rule.A couple other things.  Her neck seems to be too far to the side, and the angle of her head seems off. The face looks funny, it seems her lips are too far down. Tho the hands could be better, they are hard to draw, so I won't put that against you.  But they at least need to be the same size, and the right hand is too small.  Also the tail fins are too small.  I assume she doesn't have ears on purpose, it makes sense because dolphins have no outer ears.But, actually, overall it looks really good,if you don't focus on those things, especially if you're not realy picky like I am.  The shading is great, like I said, especially her hair.  And I like how you have the kelp going outside the frame.Wow, it's been a long time since I've criticized someone's artwork that much.   I don't like to do it, because people get mad a lot when I do it.  But I'm just trying to help.  So I hope you're not upset.

I read one romance novel once.  Overall it was really good.  Can't think of the title just now.  But I think all adult romance novels have...adult themes (which is why they're adult novels).  And, they don't just mention it or just lead up to it like in a movie....they...describe things...I think all adult romance novels are like that.

Well NOW things seem to be about normal, except that it's colder than usual.  And that's compared with the kind of weather we used to get before we started having warmer winters.  But what we had earlier was not normal.  I rememeber what normal was like.  And I don't remember ever having roller-coaster temperatures like that, where it'd be 15 one day and 57 the next, and then 30 the day after.  Or 93 for two days, and then 30 the following week.  And I don't remember ever having rain, sleet, snow, and sunshine all in one day, even in Michigan.  So, that wasn't normal compared to any standards.  At least not from what I've witnessed.

Tethys for most portrait painters, which seems to the the majority of people around here, the light sourcing is behind the viewer, in the dimentional sense for all but a few exceptions. The light isn't part of the scene because its dimentionally above the plane of the paper, or in the sense of perspective, somewhere along the positive Z axis from the reference datum.That small point light relection is called a specular light. Its a property of a glossy surface, usually a non-plainer one.  The specular point is a function of the angle between the surface curve and vector of the camera. (this asumes that the reflective object is reciving light. You can't have a specular where the light is at an oblique angle to the surface.)

answers below "Whitefin Dolphinius" &lt;whitefin@arkonviox.com&gt;To Monday, April 22, 2002 3 You may think we're nusences now, but..&gt; I have a question for you. I asked you about the messages in the pastbefore, and how you said it was Ecco's ancestors. Then after reading thereplies you gave a few of my fellow podmates on an Ecco fan site. I began towonder.ED&gt;&gt; sorry I might have mistyped  Cassandra whoengineered the the glyphs for ecco and prepared the time machine so thatecco could beat the vortex. The Dreamcast version of ecco, I had nothing todo with... so I really don't know where the story goes. Maybe one day Iwill have the oppertunity to make another ecco sequel - then I could tietogether all the story elements.&gt;&gt; I know that I've e-mailed you before about the Ecco games, but I've nowhad a sudden urg to ask these. Please, reply if you have the time.&gt;&gt; Best Wishes,&gt; Claire "Whitefin" Turner&gt; Ecco Website//cityofatlantis.arkonviox.com/&gt; Art Website//callyfin.dolphinparadise.net/&gt; E-mail: whitefin@arkonviox.com

<div id='container'>
oh yesh, lets help Ed be able to make another Ecco.  Then old school fans would be pleased, to bad getting involved with pother's property and telling them what to do with it is illegal.eao would of been cool, but now out of place for "ecco 3"but then agian she saves ecco.so those hoved wofe things had sonar speech eh?  wait no, we're talking before them.

I have run short of time.  Exams are just next week.  I will be that busy i can;t go to this forum.  How can these teachers surely expect you to remember things from 4 years ago. :(
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The phin part loox pretty good w. the ecception of the fluke...it looks too thick. i kinda agree w. tethys about the webbed hands...next time, lose the webbing. (theys: otters have webbing too. and i know about fishing cats. fun to draw too!) either the head is too big or the torso is too short, but either way the hands are way too small. the hand should be almost as long as the fore~arm. i think you should draw lines to indicate the hollow of the throat and the clavicle. now the face....the chin is too large and the angle is skewed. th eoverall pose is kinda awkward as well.okay nuff of that. its prolly too late for those changes anyhow. i adore the background. its very nice in a graphical sense. im alwasy in favor of subjects outside the border. the light shafts are very dynamic and add a bit of motion. i also like the marking on the phins body.that is all. ;D

I want Ed to rejoin appaloosa, and make them all his bitches one again, so they can make Ecco 3, the continuatuion to  the tides of time. David brin was okay, but the foe sucked dick, and they need to pick up where they left off!

Yes, I beleive I do. You wrote Etain, correct? Great story. I did come in a loooong time ago but alas, lost my connection!

Argh...  :x Exam scedule moved up a bit... My Euro test begins on May 3rd. That gives me a whole... 2 days. Then it will be finished the tenth, a week later. Its not that I don't like europe, its that they gave us a lot to know about, and the school year dosen't end for another month or so after the exam. There are harder exams out there, But i had to pay $60 for this one. Oh, an art exam, I took one of those last year. Not a big one, the teacher knew that half the class blew off the course because it was required, so the people who paid attention did well. I remember having to interpret the techniques used in a picture and how it added to its meaning. She didn't tell us the picture's title, meaning, or painter. and it wasn't very good either.

Heh... those are great, I feel obligated to post my own.This too was an email:   When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens wouldn't work in zero gravity. To combat the problem, NASA scientists spent a decade of research and $12 billion to develop a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, underwater on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures from below freezing to 300C.   The Russians used a pencil.

That WOULD be really cool if the new Ecco game was like Age of Empires, only you fight in the ocean with different people online   I Wonder if they ever will come out with it and how long its gonna take them. Ed should have helped SEGA with DotF because I bet he could have made the Foe better. Anyways, I just think its really awesome that their coming out with a sequel. Another new game for the collection!

yum, Pacyderm porn....It's not really "animal porn" in this book that I'm talking about.... More like: Neanderthal(sp?) porn 8O . I'll quote a sex part of it if you want........ Once a female came into oestrus. She walked provocatively past the indolent males, who rose from their slumbers with growls of interest. A brief contest of shouting and wrestling resolved itself in favor of Stripeskull, and he took the female by the paw and led her to the back of the cave.The coupling of this two muscle-bound creatures was noisy and spectacular. Afterwards the pair of them returned to the hearth, sweating and exhilarated.....

It appears it does follow you. Watch the cideo of the first game from TOT, and you will see that the orca DOES follow ecco.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Well the first one ws done using a birds eye view. You were on earth, looking for peices of your crashed ship. You would look for the elevator on each level, which would take you to the next. If there was a peice on the level you would be told, and you would get gifts to use in play. Also, if there was not a ship peice on the level, you could just find the elavtor, and all the maps were randomized!

Just put in some really cool dolphin facts or just any kind of cool info; and after a while this could be a really cool topic.I'll start, Did you know that the orca isn't really a whale? Its actually just a really big dolphin! *Orcas are classified in the dolphin family*Please submit and have fun!

How can these teachers surely expect you to remember things from 4 years ago. :(From 4 years ago??? That is a really messed up system!   I never heard of having an exam over stuff from the past 4 years.   Ours are only over the past year, and some teachers make them only over the past semester.Artreus-You paid $60 to take an exam??  Now if it was something like the SAT or ACT, that makes sense.  But for a school exam?  That's even more messed up.  What kind of system would make you pay to take an exam?And why in the hell would art be a required course?  That makes no sense at all.  Most people will never do anything with art, and I can't imagine any colleges would require it, unless you're going to one that specializes in art studies.

The Orca used to be a member of family Delphinidae, the same as dolphins. Now many scientists put it into family Globicephalidae because of its blunt head and relativley few teeth. (I still consider it a dolphin) It is the only whale that that hunts other warm-blooded animals. An orca is pregnant for 15 to 17 months before giving birth. The dorsal fin of a male orca can be over 5 feet tall.There is such a thing as a bottle-nosed whale (not refering to the dolphin) Family Ziphiidae. They grow up to be over 30ft long and keep the bottle nose, yet not in the same proportion. I believe it lives off the coast of Nova Scotia and hunts for squid in very deep waters.The Hippo is the closest relative to the whale.Female sperm whales do not have the pronounced box like head as their male counter parts. Within this boxhead is the spermesetti organ, which produces the oil sought after by whalers. Because it was only on the male sperm whale, it was thought to be related to sperm production, hence the name. There is some disagreement about whether the Sperm Whale's specific name should be macrocephalus (meaning 'big head') or catodon (meaning 'teeth only in lower jaw'), although the former is generally accepted.The humpback whale's scientific name means 'new englander'Interesting pointoops look up the Essex on the internet (the whaling ship) the pre-green peace whaling resistance.

No one likes New York's new education standards, and even fewer understand them. The Euro exam is a college test, and therfore has to be paid for. The school actually chipped in twenty bucks or so per exam, but with only 14 people taking European history...The diploma requires one art credit Studio Art1, Chorus, Band, Orcestra, DDP (Design and Drawing for Production) and maybe there's another music course. As mentioned, many people know all too well that art is a required course and blow it off. There were more upperclass students in Art1 than whatever course I'm in know.  What I don't like, is trying to be an art student and not being able to draw. That's probably why the Art1 exam didn't require anything to be drawn, No one was there to learn how, I'll probably have to draw something at the end of this course however.  Blast, I'm rambling again. If only I talked as much as I type, then maybe my classmates would know my name.

Romance Novels again? They're just gay. While it's POSSIBLE (and I'm willing to admit) that SOME of them (and I mean a very small few) actually have a plot to them that's somewhat interesting... they all basically have these things in common, which I figured out listening to Jader ramble on about the bloody thingsroll:Actually the one I read wasn't like that.  It's called Lord of Vengeance, which is a stupid title.  But it was a good book.  It had a plot.  It may not have been the most original of plots, but it was well written.  I might have had the first rule you mentioned, but I can't remember.  And the only other thing that it had that you mentioned was the guy kidnapped the woman.  He did it to get revenge on his sworn enemy.  And he was actually a pretty cool character, in my opinion, not a bastard or a jackass.  There was really only two actual sex scenes, and two short scenes that were close.  The guy only had one previous experience.  And they actually fell in love before doing anything intimate.  And the girl was actually bold and brave, not stupid, and before she fell in love with this guy she tried to escape.  And I don't think they actually argued at all except once or twice before they fell in love. That's the only romance novel I've read, so I don't know how well those "rules" fit in.

Well both games were on the Genesis.  I rented the first one once, it was realy fun.  I liked it a lot.  But I never saw it in stores after that.  I used to own the second one, but I never played it much.  The second one was kinda stupid, I didn't like it nearly as much.  I never did get very far in the first one, and I think I only found one spaceship piece.  But I spent most of the time fooling around.  It's too bad I don't have an X-Box, and I doubt I'll get one anytime soon if I ever do get one.That game was so funny, even my mom liked it because she thought it was funny.

Chapter 2The meeting stone was worn hollow by ancient currents of seawater rushing in and out from what used to be cave at sea~level. The booming tide had carved the living stone for thousands of years before ocean levels rose worldwide and submerged the cave. Now it served as the meeting place for tribe elders and council members. The Outcast dolphins twittered and chirred with each other, their quiet conversations buzzing in the tense waters. Wide dark eyes caught the meager light as the sun set and filtered its dying rays past the shifting waves. Several were silent, their hearts torn and spirits dulled. Taniel was one of the quiet ones. He felt empty now that his dark responsibility had been fulfilled. When he told his father what had happened he did not know what to expect. His guesses were hollow and he had no desire to fill them. His father had at first said nothing, only staring at him with a questioning look, searching his face for a sign of hope orsome kind of joke. Then his mother had appeared, and Taniel made as if to speak but his father had silenced him with a sharp glance. He swam to Taniel's mother and whispered something in her ear. Her eyes narrowed and she clapped her teeth in question, but she followed her mate into the next room, out of Tanial's sight.It was not long before a horrible keening noise cut the water and sliced Taniel's heart to the core. His emotions shattered, and soon his cries joined his mother's in torturous lament.Now he was spent and felt empty, a husk drifting among the waves. It all seemed unreal, for it was not but that morning that his brother had left, grinning, saying he would forage something special for Mama and Papa--perhaps bring some light to their dull and weary eyes. He always was thinking of others. Now he was dead, too soon, too cruel. Taniel stared above him, watching the mosaic of motion above him. Light danced like fluid stars as it changed from pink to yellow to pale orange red. The whispers and buzzing stopped abruptly and brought Taniel to attention. The Council Elders were slowly making their way through the crowd. They reached the center and faced out, tails down and heads up. There were 9 of them, all old and wise, their ear dimples puckered and wrinkled with age, and bodies slightly bent. Five females and four males looked all around them, meeting the many dark eyes one by one. Their own eyes were blank and clouded, shrouding whatever they themselves might be feeling. One of the Elders rose slightly higher than the others."It is with a heavy heart that I call this meeting," said Affela, the oldest of the council and the matriarch. "A terrible crime has been committed and it is the duty of this council to plan a course of action. For those of you who may not have heard, we lost a member of our pod today. Young Heytcha was killed by a Clan member early this morning. He is survived by his parents, Li and Ly Kep, and his older brother, Tanial, who has joined us tonight in place of his parents, who are to grief stricken to leave their home." She gave a quick nod in Tanial's direction. "It was Tanial who witnessed the murder." Many whirs and chirps sounded at that, but quickly died down as Affela continued her speech. "Li~Taniel says that he heard his brother's cries for help, but was too far away to save Heytcha. He says that by the time he had arrived at the scene, the Clan member had already killed Heytcha and there was nothing he could do." Affela sank as N'yil, one of the male Elders, rose. "However difficult this may be, we must first surmise why the Clan dolphin attacked in the first place. Was it provoked? Did Heytcha inadvertently anger the beast? What drove it to kill?""I'll tell you what!" one of the dolphins in the crowd yelled. "They're bloodthirsty killers that's what!" Several voices murmured in assent. Another female of the Elders clapped her beak. "Now be quiet! We are civilized phins here and we will not tolerate such brashness.""No!" cried Tanial, unable to control himself. All eyes focused on him and he became acutely self conscience.N'yil opened his beak to silence him but Affela waved her flippers. "Let him speak." N'yil sank into place and Tanial dutifully rose."I saw this Clan monster with my brother. I saw its eyes. It took pleasure from his pain. It tortured him to death! My brother would never have done anything to anyone. This was cruel, pre-meditated murder and the Clan should take responsibility for its actions!" His voice cracked."And what should we do?" said Affela. "Go to the Clan's Exalted Ones and demand justice?""Yes!"Several sharp whistles and hisses met Tanial's vehement reply."Do you realize the absurdity of that suggestion? Do you really think that we can just swim into the city like we have any right to do so? We are Outcasts, young one, and that title holds meaning. We are banished forever from Clan society. We are invisible to them.""If we are so invisible then why don't leave us alone?" cried a distraught female. "This is not the first attack, nor will it be the last!""What can we do?" said Tanial. "Why isn't there any way to combat them?""Should we flee?""No! We've lived here for generations. We can't just abandon the cove. It's out home.""Well we can't fight them. They are killing our children! What will we do when a whole army of Clan beasts invades our village? They'll do it someday mark my words."The whole council was buzzing with fear and anger. They ignored the Elder's sharp clicks for order. Tanial heard someone calling his name very close to his ear. He turned to see Affela, N'yil, and another Elder male, Sertway. Affela's dark black eyes swept Tanial's face as she spoke. "You've caused quite a mess here Tanial. Follow us to the center."He felt a sudden flare of pain. He clicked angrily as he saw where Sertway had nipped his flipper. He glared at the old one."Move," Sertway grunted.The Elders told him to stand up tall so he could be seen. From his vantage, he saw his kind squawking and whistling at each other, all torn and frightened. Several scuffles had broken out and they were butting and nipping each other. He thought of his brother. They had beached his body on the sandy shores not far from the village. There he could rest free of sharks and breathe the sweet tropical air for all eternity. If only he had not been killed, he thought sadly. What would he want them to do? Protect each other for sure. But look at us! He thought dismally. Fighting amongst ourselves. That's what the Clan would like us to do. Then they could move in and kill us all."Listen to us!" Affela shouted over the din. "Here we have the victim of the beast's attack." The conversations died off as she continued. "Here we have the loudest voice for justice. Here we have the one who will go to the city and plead on our behalf."Tanial felt his heart skip. "What?!" He looked down at the nine elders."Shh!" hissed a female, Friell."Tanial has volunteered to meet before the Clan and discuss punishment for the perpetrator of this crime. He leaves tonight and will be at the gates by dawn. If any of you are as brave and have the same strong beliefs, you are welcome to join him."The sun had finally set and a sudden darkness washed the through the water. Dozens of glittering eyes stared at him in awe and disbelief. His heart hammered in his chest and his gills worked furiously. What were these old crones up to? He cast them an angry look but said nothing. Not now. Not in front of everyone. He pressed a tight smile and nodded at the group.Whistles of approval broke out amongst the group. "Bravo!" "He's so brave." "Amazing." "What will become of him?"What will become of me? he wondered as he as he dropped out if the spotlight and followed the Council out of the Meeting Place and listened to the crowd disperse. Affela and Friell flanked him. He kept giving them sharp glances and small, angry buzzes. They ignored him, and they all swam in silence to the far edges of the village. Two other dolphins, neither of which he knew very well, were waiting for them at the entrance of the Council's hut.Their flippers flared for a moment as they noticed the group's approach. The two swam up to greet them.Taniel felt their dark eyes pass over his body before they dipped their heads to the Elders and chirped respectfully. Several Elders slowed to speak to them and Taniel was going to do the same, but Friell and Affela pushed him forward, nuzzling him firmly into the hut. Before he was out of earshot, he heard the two speaking to the three Elders that remained outside."We are here to join Taniel" they began.Join meHe pondered this for a moment while he was ushered into the stark room of the Elders. Without warning, Friell flipped and clubbed Taniel across the face with her powerful tail. Black dots and red spines lanced his vision and his echo-vision was thrown off. Disoriented, he struck out with concentrated bursts of sonar and charged.His actions were met with fierce blows from several sharp snouts. Each jab felt like fire and made him even angrier."What are you doing!" he yelled, his eyes squeezed tight and his body curling to protect his delicate gills. "Stop!"To his surprise, they did stop. Gills fluttering rapidly, he cautiously opened his eyes and snapped his jaws together, a dire threat. Snaps filled the room as the other dolphins did the same."Youwereoutofline, brat!" growled Friella. A sharp clap of teeth and hard rostrum punctuated each word.N'yil swam close and brought his knobby muzzle close to Taniel's. "You had no business stirring the pod up like that," he said. "You have jeopardized the delicate balance of this situation. Now they demand some form of justice. Do you realize how ridiculous that is? Justice?!" His sharp eyes glittered menacingly. "We are left alone for the most part, and they will continue to do so if we abide by their rules." He nipped Taniel when he saw him open his beak in indignation. "Some casualties are to be expected""Casualties?!" Taniel lost control of himself. He lunged at N'yil and bit him as hard as he could, just below the left eye. N'yil's scream of pain and rage reverberated in the room and Taniel had the grim satisfaction of seeing fear flash in the old one's eyes. Perhaps you feel a little of what my brother felt, he thought grimly.In an instant, there was chaos. Elders surrounded him and he fought with tooth and tail. He didn't care who he hit or where, he simply attacked. Buzzes, whirrs, and squeals filled his ears as he sought for a way out. At one point a dolphin backed away from him, shouting at him, and he rammed his snout against his flank, then bit his dorsal ridge and fled past him. He swam as fast as he could out of the Center and into the open water. He had planned to head for his parents hut and be free of these bigots, but several sets of teeth fastened onto his tail, slowing him enough so that more jaws were able to clamp onto his flippers and dorsal ridge. His rage left him as abruptly as it had come, along with his strength. He listed in the water as the Elders again surrounded him.Affela had somehow avoided his attack and remained unscathed. Her eyes however, were scathing. Her flippers were flared wide and her head was low and cocked to the side. All three were signs of extreme anger."How dare you attack the members of the council!" she said."How dare you attack me!" he yelled back."You are under our jurisdictions. You have violated several most important laws, laws that bind this community together""My brother was part of this community! He did everything for this shithole! He is not a 'casualty' or statistic.""Silence!!" Affela practically roared. The vehemence in her voice surprised everyone."Taniel, your actions this evening are inexcusable. You almost created a riot back there and went even further in provoking them by suggesting that someone go speak to the Clan, endangering more lives! So it is you Taniel, that are to go to the gates. How could you presume that someone else would run such a foolish errand? You will go, and you will not come back. We cannot sustain troublemakers in this community." She turned away from him, leaving his mind full of one phrase: You will not come back. Exile.He swallowed and looked from one face to the next. Most were hard and resolute, but some held pity, as well asshame? He wasnt sure in the dark waters.Exile.He would have to leave his parents, his family, his friends. He wouldn't be able to say goodbye. Their faces swam in his mind. Faces he had seen since he was a calf. Faces that had connoted trust and security. Some of those faces were ones of the Elders, who had betrayed Heytcha and himself. He felt his heart harden and his blood run cool. Such is lifeHe looked around one last time, feeling an emptiness that was worse than the grief that had held him so tightly in its grip not but an hour before. At least grief was something. This was nothing. A void. He swam away into the darkness of the waters, feeling eyes on his back the whole time. Not even a slight chirp goodbye was said, and the coldness intensified.Taniel swam past the outer rocks of the village. Despite himself, he looked back. The village lay in serene, moonlit waters. The coral trees' gentle arcs and swirls added to the tranquility. Quiet buzzes and dream songs permeated the aqua stillness. Taniel sighed heavily.Such is lifeA polite click caught his attention. He faces the sound and saw the two dolphins who had volunteered to join him on his "mission.""What are you doing here?" he asked."Li-Taniel," said one, a pale green dolphin with black spots freckled across his back. He was obviously nervous for his gills were erratically working and he kept cocking his head. "We came to help you speak to the Clan dolphins."Taniel scowled. "I'm not going to see the Clan. I was banished. I'm an Exile."The other dolphin nodded. "Yes, we know. The Elders told us there was to be no mission since you were considered a troublemaker. We did not believe them, so we went into the Center regardless of what they said.""We entered the room and we saw you going ballistic!" Admiration filled his voice. "I've never heard of anyone attacking the Elders before.""Aye. What a scene! You are a remarkable fighter." The pale one slid forward and Taniel saw thin trails of blood."Diddid I do that?" he asked.The wounded dolphin nodded. "Aye. But, it isn't all that bad. It will heal. The damage done by the Clan will not." His eyes clouded over. "Pacifism is not always the answer," he muttered.The other, a small dolphin with yellow streaks behind each eye, nuzzled him. He looked at Taniel out of the corner of his eye, his eyes telling him not to ask."Well, what do you want with me?""We already said! We want to go into the city and speak to the beasts.""They won't listen.""If the do notwe will have to make them listen."Taniel frowned. Make them listen? Why would they listen to uswe are mere Outcasts, deemed unworthyHis mind tripped over itself. He had to change his ways of thinking. Wasn't Haytcha's life just as important as some Clan member's? Of course it was, and more! Heytcha only cared for phins, not hurt them. Why shouldn't they be listened to? They had a voice! They had pathetic lives while the Clan lived in luxury and grandeur. Why the hell should they live in such poverty? Because the Clan said so? Who were they to run their lives? The more he thought, the angrier he became. His anger felt good for it filled the dangerous void. They would make them listen. And if the Clan refusedTaniel thought about his fight with the elders. It was the first time he had ever attacked anyone, in defense or offense. Yet, he had almost managed to escape. He had managed to wound several Elders. The thoughts gave him hope, a small, tiny hope. He looked at the two. "What are your names?""Mell," said the dark one."Derin" said the small one.You really want to follow this through? Actually go to the gates and demand to be let in?"Both nodded and clicked emphatically."You know we might be killed.""We do not care," said Mell. "We have nothing to lose." Taniel wondered about that, but chose not to ask.He turned and faced the open sands. The city was beyond the low coral and sand. If they swam without stopping, they could make the gates a little after midnight. They could then rest and get some sleep."Let's go."End Of Chapter 2

I am going to send my third and final email to mr. Annuziata, creator of Ecco 1 and 2. If anyone has any questions or comments they would like asked, please tell me!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have heard there is much confusion over who is Kitnee and who is Tara. I set out in my pre-online days to find out which was which and arrived at the same conclusion as Arkon's post above. To put the topic to rest, this is the simple evidence I found Some dolphin tells you that 'Blackfin and Tara are down below.' There are no Orcas in this level. Therefore, Tara is a dolphin.What I havn't liked about Tara is simply that she has a human name. To get around this, I pronounce it as 'Tarrah' with two short a's as opposed to 'Terra' the name of some people have. Of course, others may pronounce it differently anyway.

1st person You went over there.3rd person: Bubba went over there.Trying to add another person is like trying to draw a picture showing the forth dimension.Adding different perspectives is different. You hear part of the story as one person experienced it, and in the next scene the story continues as someone else percives it. This allows you to create a passage of time, or to add a sence of urgency.

The new Ecco game better look freak'n awesome! They'll ruin the game if they don't have good graphics and a good storyline, but I think they'll pull through on this one. If there is a Gameboy Advance Ecco coming out then I'd better keep my eyes on the lookout! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, the GBA rendition is due out packed with golden axe, and sonic spinball, in July. I am going to ask Ed if he will ever make a new game, and if he even has rights to do so.

I think they should just get something special in their fanfare. Like a pic or soemthing, or a banner, that says they got an award, like when websites win awards. Also, they should get a copy in a .gif to put on their site if any. Good idea? you be the judge!

Seems like Ifni's dice decided that this issue be brought up in Brin-L just two days after I subscribed to it.. Quoted the info I was been able to grope from the latest digest "Horn, John" &lt;JHorn@healthlink.com&gt;To Startide Movie?Has anyone heard anything lately on the Startide Rising movie?T.Sands, are you still out there?  Is this officially a dead project?  Or asclose to it as anything gets in Hollywood... - jmhFrom Re BRIN-L@cornell.edu (Brin-L)I'm still out here.  Last I heard about Startide it was still drifting inlimbo, after Roland Emmerich backed out.  It doesn't really have a home rightnow, though the producer Mace Neufeld is still behind it and would love toget it made.  It's just such and EXPENSIVE movie, there's only a handful ofguys who have the juice to make it happen.  So unless someone like Jim   Cameron, Ridley Scott, or Tim Burton comes on board I'd call it a dead project.  It's possible, but unlikely, it will be made any time soon.   T.SandsFrom RE BRIN-L@cornell.edu (Brin-L)I think he said something about it becoming an animated movie. But that waswell over a year ago, so I could be wrong.Kevin StreetFrom BRIN-L@cornell.edu (Brin-L)Subject Brin-L Weblog (Was Re Commentary Fri, 03 May 2002 1959 -0400&lt;snipped out stuff about cataloguing links found from Brin-L emails&gt;And about the Startide Rising story project...

Umm... hi. * smiles in the general direction of the big local pod *Since it seems to be the first thing you want to know about every newcomer... Yes, I believe I will stick around the community, at least as long as I keep on reading the fiction in the fanfare section, and that will take long enough...Now, for the more mundane details ;). I'm a Finnish high school student, leading a rather pleasant but event-dry real life as a lonely absent-minded thinker, and a rather speedy Internet life as the only known transmicronational cetacean bartender (who swims in human blood, or at least swam, until he was assassinated by sulphuric acid, causing him to transcend his physical form) and the Shirerothian god of Linux. I just co-won the award of Coolest Person Overall in the Apollo Sector Millennium Jubilee with an Irish wombat. I am also known for being the most active poster of the Istvanistani OT, the one place that many of my "colleagues" acknowledge as ultimate nest of complete and utter insanity.Confused?I can understand that. In any case, that's what I am like as a 'net presence. It's what micronationalism (I won't even try to explain what it is) leads to //www.kithrup.com/brin ) I came upon a short piece of information about the game Ecco the Dolphin: Defender fo the Future. I wasn't too interested at first, but nonetheless I searched a few reviews of the game and googled for more information. Then every way (except some ads of expensive shoes) just led here, and I somehow grew interested over time. Maybe it was the nice website, maybe it was the link to Onion I found, (dolphins evolve opposable thumbs -&gt; one of the best laughs I've ever had) maybe it was the pleasant-looking community, in any case I ended up registering and choosing to not only lurk. And... well... that's all I have to say for introducing myself. Autographs and extra speeches will be given on demand ;).

If you look for it, you'd be suprised at how many times you can find '42' in real life. I put it on a collage in Health class to describe myself, but no one got it. Any classics should be read, they show up everywere The same applies to movies. Startide Rising makes reference to Iago- A character from Shakespear's play Othello. Can't understand every other word Shakespear writes, but Othello is better than Romeo and Juliet.  Come to think of it... My profile number is 42.

Weell... let's say that I belong to the group of Linux users who love tinkering but don't actually have a clue if something goes wrong, and even if things didn't work, don't know what's actually happening. A good example of this is that before I got a fixed 'net connection and finally got back to richer waters (as opposed to being stranded with a 2.2.19_rev3)  I didn't even know what my version of XFree was Gdk-ERROR ** I'd be interested to see that... In other parts of the 'net (micronations - where loyalty is nothing and humour is black)  I've been using a rather ugly, quickly cropped pic of a very generic dolphin with a little bit of (incorrectly made, I might add) colouring to make the dolphin swim in human blood   .

welcome Ari, i didn't think you would post but im glad you did you seem like an interesting person.A david brin fan, i have to say i didn't like the story if Defender of the future as much as the other Ecco's but...it's not to say i hated Defender of the Future, the game was still good, sometimes the fan base makes me want to choke the living crap out of them because they get the oldsckool ecco confused with the new school.i have to admit to you Ari im as shocked as you are just to how fanficts started booming on this site. I been wanting to push it but when it comes to the website i have so many projects the only time i can get out of a cycle of what to do is when people send stuff in and bug me about doing something. and to be honest im glad people do it.a linux user eh? you even suggested some good emu sites, alright i surrender i'll trie to get some more emulators up. tonight i don't relly have nothing to do so i might as well work on a different project, since i need a break from the flash movie im working on.anyhow glad you joined us and welcome!

*coughs* Well, the water tube that Ecco swam through, was the remainder of the vortex storm, and if you watch the movie more, when he's about to enter the city that the vortex have - the entrance is robotic and looks like the tube from the game - either, its the entrance to their ship. or they have one fucked up planet. Then again, the vortex can live in water - perhaps they've got dome citys, that hold in the liquids as they're planet it's self may be dry on the outside? Perhaps.. we should ask Ed.. about the planet, the kind.. etc.

Well... in Ecco2, in the vortex future, Ecco is on what I always assumed was a ship. But it could very well be some building. If it were a building, why wouldn't they have similar stuff of their planet.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I assumed that you where on a ship in ToT, It just didn't seem right to have a floating city when they feed apon life in the ocean...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
... it was a spaceship
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You are wrong. Me and Arkon discussed this. In the game it says that the vortex planet and earth form a link due to a strange gravitational pull between the two planets, which is how the vortex obtain there food. The link is the tube of water, stretching from planet to plant. It happens once every 500 years because that is when pegasus is closest to Sol. (our solar system) So, they don't use a ship.

Well... It's a cool book. You can't put it down. (Which was very good for me, seeing as how I got to read it for English class: "Alright class, you should have chosen you book by now and read it over the next three weeks. What? You're done already?"A pity the movie isn't working out though. I guess I'll just have to read the book again.

Link to the article you missed (with normal settings, I think it was this thread that pushed the Onion article thread off from page one)//www.theonion.com/onion3630/dolphins_evolve_thumbs.htmlI got the avatar, however, I didn't quite like it... No offense intended, but I'd rather not use an avatar at all than to use an avatar that doesn't fit my personality/character or is too bland...

Yeah Jader... you really beat me too it. I should have got up at 5roll: Anyways... it was cool. Of course I would say so... I love Spider-Man. But it WAS cool! I think the 2nd one will be much better though, because they wont have to spend half the movie on how he got his powers and all that stuff. I can't wait! And as we speak, I'm drawing a Spider-Man fanart! ^_^ Yeah! Spida' Man rulz!

Online ecco would be sweet (though I must admit the only online video game I've ever played is No One Lives Forever)- but if I were to play it it'd have to be a computer game- we can't hook up DC.  Well, extra characters worked for Spyro (3/Year of the Dragon).... If you were a whale you could be underwater longer...What if you got to be the giant shark/mutant sharks from Dolphin/Man's nightmares from DoF? :-D That'd be sweet... Unlimited underwater time, huge jaws. There isn't much action, but I like the puzzles (even the really hard ones). Not that I don't enjoy action- it just wouldn't seem right for a dolphin to go around slamming sharks in the gills and seeing blood pouring through the water like a tap. Personally, the foe were a challenge (the ones that look like snakes and shoot heat-seeking "missiles" especially) to me. But they didn't do much for being the conquerors of the world.  Sex appeal? I think it's stupid when people buy games just cuz they have hot/scantily clad people in them. Not to mention perverted. I mean, whadda you want ecco to do? Go out and have sex with every female dolphin (coughtrelliacough) he meets? Or, if I wanted to start talking wasted, he could wear big wax lips around ;) Okay okay not funny but still.... How could you even make ecco have any sex appeal? It works for some non-human characters, but I can't see it working for a dolphin, sorry. Multiplayer would be kick ass! Especially if the whole game were multi-player, so that one could be ecco, and the other be like an orca or whale or whatever, etc. I don't think adding one or more characters would hurt ecco's image much since he's had so many games already. As long as they don't get more screen time... *shrug* Mostly I liked ecco as it was... But maybe they could have ecco in space? I mean, in DoF they had all the people and dolphins floating off in them bubble thingies, so maybe they have Ecco landing on another planet and have lots of weird alien fish and stuff....  overall, I can't think of many ways to improve ecco. I actually loved DoF. For one, it's one of the only games I know of whose movie graphics match its  gameplay graphics. For another, it's a totally unique plot. There aren't really any completely underwater games. I certainly can't think of any. Finally, it had plot. Which is a thing a lot of games lack. I mean, you play ecco and maybe there's not a lot of action, but you have a purpose. There are many games today that don't fall under that category.and that's all I have to say about the subject. *_*

There are two kinds of Orca. Transients and Residents.  Residents have home ranges in which they remain most of the year, Transients move all over the place and don't live within a home range, they move up and down the coastline.Residents feed excusively on fish, while Transients feed on marine mammals such as seals, porpoises, whales, and other dolphin species.

This is frikkin outrageous. These people need to pull their heads out of their dirty, dirty, asses. I emailed the maker of the petition. THAT SHOULD SET HIM STRAIGHT! Here is the excerpt.Do you realize that the book the two towers was written 50 years ago, and that that's what the movie was named after? Or are you just an idiot? "Oh My god, save us, osama bin laden is going to come back through time, 50 years ago, because jrr tolkien knew that this would happen" My god you are stupid. If the movie's name has to be changed I hope they rename it "Kevin klerck is even more of a dumbass then JEFFK." Why would you rename it just because of that!? I feel just as bad about the trade towers as anyone, but changing the name of something as trivial as a movie over it? Are you off your frikkin nut? Sincerely Joel "Pissed off" PetersonI was pretty mad at the time, and probly said something that I shouldn't have. And the Osama Bin Laden time traveling sequence makes no sense, but....Oh Im in way over my head here...

8O Well... now that that has been said:Dolphins, other than humans, are the only species to have sex for fun.Another species has been discoverd. Living in only the waters of Antarctica, they are smaller than normal Orcas and have different markings. The National Geographic says its another species, I don't see the importance of saying it though. Actually, Most whales have different variants, one in the north, one in the south. They don't cross the equator and therefor do not interbreed.For anyone interested, www.cetacea.org has a bit of everything.

Well... That's... odd.Funny too.A 'politically correct' bible?Don't worry about your spelling, It looks like the one who wrote the thing can't spell either.Re-writing the bible? How many different views do we have about the current one?How do you find something like that anyway?

I had a new idea for a fanfic....Think of this. Ecco seemed to have lots of human traits, as well as his bretheren in the game, obviously. What if Someone, (meaning me, and artreus if he would agree) Could try to take the Ecco story line, and....Undolphinise it. Make some kind of fantasy world using humans, to slightly resemble eccos, and try to make the ecco storyline into a human story. The ideas I have are slim, but I need some opinions. Is this to Whack? or is it intriguing?I was thinking giving the world a rather oriental setting.....BAH my brain is about to explode!!

9-11 strikes again. If you kept a look out, about everthing has been blamed on the terrorist attacks. I hate to sound anti-national but, give it a rest. I better leave now before I start to take this seriesly.

<div id='container'>
NOTE: do not get the wrong idea. It would not be a human named Ecco, and would probly not be the vortex, or atlantis. It would be the same premise, as in alien life trying to purge earth. it would simply be based on minor parts of it, as in a big journey, and some kind of outside threat. It would give you a tinge that, "hey....ecco!" But would not scream it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ahh, true. And...thats all i hafta say.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
 no, I can't really picture it. Not that I would object to seeing it done, but what made Ecco's story unique was the fact that is was dolphins. Interestingly enough, I was toying with the idea of converting the play Othello into a dolphin story. Of course, that's probably just as hard, and I may upset some Shakeaspere fans. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes I see how you are right. But I need something to inspire a Human Related story. I have only written about dolphins for awhile, and I need some human influence. Can anyone help out!?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Alright. The ecco idea is closed down, that part of the thread, closed. It  Is apparent it can in no way be related to ecco. But, I am still going to work on a completely unrelated fantasy story. I have found some old stuff on my comp, actually about 11 pages, of timelines, and ideas and such. Sorry about the pointless thread

This isn't about the book. This is about the upcoming movie. These people don't even know the book even exists.  Someone even thought Tolkien was the one producing the movie.Somebody even suggested that "the fascist police" change their number from 911 to something else. Another person even knocked the name of the next Star Wars movie Attack of the Clones as being a statement that cloning is evil. Hardly relevant but just as stupid. And what's up that person who said he won't even let his twin kids stand next to each other? What next? Ban every title with the number two or the number eleven or every single representation of two objects standing next to each other?

loldolphin factdunt males have prehincile...weeniners or somthing?Sorta. Its a sigmoid muscle, simlar to the penis of a bovine or cervine. Its not "prehensile" in the true sense, but it is rather flexible. Dolphins, other than humans, are the only species to have sex for fun.True enough. They also masturbate. Alot. Homoseuxal relationships with either gender isn't uncommon, either.Theres quite a debate over if antarctic orcas are part of the same taxinomy. Its an ongoing argument thats probably never going to really be resolved (much like "pacific" vs "atlantic" bottlenose)My person opinion is that when you have a species that has worldwide distribution, localized racial groups appear. (much like the human species)

Remember Eao, the vortex can sustain life in water and such - obviously why the vortex city bieng built in the oceans in ToT was able to run efficiently, they where able to make it possible for them to still use they're technology heavilly. There is a vast number of things you can make out of the story of the vortex, theyre kind, and how they depend on machines, like us.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hhhhmmmmm.......that reminds me of something. Ever notice that there were NO Orcas in DoF? To bad, it would have been cool. They had Humpback whales at the very beginning, and plenty of varieties of dolphins, but no Orcas...hmmm.....ya gotta wonder why.Well... At least they appear in "Sonic Adventure 1" and, (probabbly) in one of those "Crash Bandicoot" games (... think it's a Crash Bandicoot 3). But unfortunately... they are all baddies.

Doomtrain Please, at least have common decency and call me Tux instead of just any penguin. That would at least keep the associations correct - while I love Pokey the Penguin, I wouldn't like people to think that I have his personality... I use, as you might have noticed, Opera. It doesn't do many things right, it isn't free, and it isn't quite stable - but at least it's the fastest browser out there. If you've ever tried Mozilla, you know that speed, for browsers, is more essential than you would think... don't take it for granted.  True, IE would be the best browser I know without that one teeny detail - it's impossible to get to work in any other OS than MSWin. (well, I've heard that some people have tried - and trashed lots of data in their Wine data directories)Phosis: Unfortunately making a "good" OS is nigh impossible... However, I believe the newer versions of RedHat and Mandrake are slowly getting there. AFAIK they aren't confusing in the same way as older Linuxes used to be, but they still give the advanced user at least a part of the fun functionality of the holy terminal. Of course, if I was to decide, the One True OS would be based on Debian, but with a very much more polished and standardised base of programs inside X. I mean, think of the Windows clipboard - it can be used to transport and copy, well, anything. There's no such thing in Linux; you can barely hope that you can move pure text between different applications if they happen to use the same libraries. Too bad it's quite damn hard to actually make programmers write useful features instead of what they themselves want to add...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Opera seems really stable for me, but as usual, I'm not using the linux version of such. I stopped using unix as a general use workstation, its just not practical really. Hard to beat FVWM2 and focus-follows-mouse xterms for coding or irc stuff ;)I use lynx or w3m at times. If that doesn't scare you I don't know what will. :DThe mouse copy method works pretty consistantly in X11
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I don't think you can think up anything that will scare me, then, as I still use Lynx routinely 1) My home comp is pretty slow. Slow enough to make me prefer Lynx over even Opera in some situations - for example, posting to ezboards or checking the dictionaries. Too bad it's pretty slow to switch between X and terminals...2) Thanks to the high concentration of Linux zealotry in the admin team of my school's computer systems, most of the workstations there are text-only terminals. This means that Lynx is pretty much my only choice (I prefer it over Links because Lynx seems to understand cookies and some CGI stuff better. It might just be about configuration, though.)

Well Phosis... I do agree that Ecco is so unique because it has dolphins and such, but I actually think that your idea is a good one! Ecco is so unique because it's dolphins, and your idea would be very unique because your tossing it off of dolphins.I think it would present some very challanging, but interesting, character designs. They could be, like, water people, who can hold there breath like dolphins and swim really good and such! And kind of mid-evil, in the sence of little technology, but at the same time very different technology (like the movie Atlantis, is what I'm thinking).Ok... so maybe this isn't such a good idea. But I thought I'd just give my 2 cents worth. *shrug* I dunno... maybe?

do gay dolphins do the sodamy thing or just a lot of touching.dolphins and such I belive, sence all they can do otherwise is talk, it's not like a bird preening or another animal making faces.so thats why I think the have the sex thing, compared to wolves, primates, parrots, people, horses  they aren't inabled to do communicating things, so they have sex.there are no ticks to groom off, or sit and chew on eachother.

(you know in Ecco 1/2, in "the Machine" levels when you "Power Sonar" the Vortex Drones, their head pops of their bodies).....2. clawed Vortex Drone - (the one in "Ecco 2" - lunar bay) with moveable claws.3. Vortex Queen A - (Ecco 2) - retractable jaws.4. Vortex Queen B - (Ecco 2) - Durable Rubber, Squeezable (fill'er up with water, squeeze, she "vomits/throws up")............................

bah the pocket arcade has been in my reach in fact vantid owns it. its nothing great. my next search will be for ecco for sega saturn...that was the more complete version of ecco 32x cause they made it for 32x then ported it to saturn and worked on alot more. it was pretty wierd, but i want to trie to bring more pieces to this strasnge puzzle together.plus theres a rumor going around that yet another 32x rom exists for ecco thats more complete then the copy i have. i contacted a few people to shed some light who knows what they will say.

Maybe death isnt a good idea. But there are other ways. Something could have happened to him when he was lost in the tides of time maybe? And maybe it could also lead off into ed's Idea for a third game, where ecco goes back to atlantis or whatever? Maybe it could be that back then, when atlantis existed, humans were also around, cause they obviously arent in ecco 1 and 2. Hmm...It is something to ponder about.

I don't think anything happened to my computer that would make it go all funny, but it has.The built in eraser on the back doesn't work anymore, and it's generally just acting funny (moving around funny).I was thinking that maybe I could just unplug it from the USB port and plug it back in, but I wasn't sure if I should do that (being not to computer smart).

Puh i think arkons joking.  Wow isnt it convenient that the part that "only works till it freezes" is the same intro movie that i have on realplayer.  i could have faked those screenshots easy with even paintbrush, and all i'd need is a picture from te movie and a picture of the emulator's window.  Not to mention if someone really had this bitchass find i think they would fucking share it.  And isnt it just atad odd that arkon cant give it to us for undefined reasons?Well arkon it was pretty funny but i think we should get back to more important things like ecco 2 beta ;)

God created the Christain/Jewish/Cathloic/spin offs of those/religon where those were stolen from's world and sunk it, cuz he didn't like the Greeks and there Gods and Goddesses.Whoever said the people of Atlantis were Greek?  Nobody knows where it actually was, if it existed.  I saw this show on it and one guy speculated it may have actually been this one spot in South America, but I dunno about that.  But, anyway, I wasn't talking about that.  All I said was that I assumed that the Atlantis in the Ecco games was supposed to be the same as the legend or at least based on it, and that the Atlanteans were humans and not dolphins, like some people seem to think.

Okay, while I still have it on my mind, I must set one thing straight.  What's the deal with this whole Ecco/Trellia romance thing?  The first time Trellia appears in ToT, she says "I am Trellia and you are my ancestor."  She is saying that Ecco is her ancestor, that she is his descendant.  In other words, Ecco is like Trellia's great, great, great, etc...grandfather!  I get the impression some people seem to think there should be some sort of romantic connection between them.  They are relatives! Trellia even says so herself!Okay I'm done.

Creatures/Varieties1.white/black Vortex Drone - (the one with 4 hands) has a reatachable head. (you know in Ecco 1/2, in "the Machine" levels when you "Power Sonar" the Vortex Drones, their head pops of their bodies).....2. clawed Vortex Drone - (the one in "Ecco 2" - lunar bay) with moveable claws.3. Vortex Queen A - (Ecco 2) - retractable jaws.4. Vortex Queen B - (Ecco 2) - Durable Rubber, Squeezable (fill'er up with water, squeeze, she "vomits/throws up")Okay, but what about Ecco?  What could a dolphin action figure possibly do, besides having movable fins?  And then they wouldn't even be able to move that much, not like arms.

Ecco 2: Some dolphin tells you that 'Blackfin and Tara are down below.' There are no Orcas in this level. Therefore, Tara is a dolphin.When was THAT??  I sure as hell don't remember that even in the slightest bit.  I don't remember any Blackfin and I don't remember Tara being in any game except for Ecco Jr.  I know that I would remember it if I saw it.  I probably just somehow missed that part.In Ecco Jr.  Tara WAS the Orca, and Kitnee was the dolphin.  I remember.  It said so in the instruction manuel.  I never actually owned the game, but I remember very well that Tara was the orca in that game.  And I also still have an old picture I drew of the three characters from Ecco Jr. and wrote the names above each one, and I labeled the orca as Tara and the dolphin as Kitnee.  And I know I didn't label them wrong, I distinctly remember reading the instruction manual and that it said that Tara is an orca and Kitnee is an Atlantic bottle-nosed dolphin or whatever.  That's in Ecco Jr.

Yeah. there has always really been a debate about that. So, I wanted to see what people thought. Then, i found the eco 2 video, and it became apparent that there was no ship, as it showed that wierd water tube thing that ecco was going through. Then, the string just kinda continued, in a diff direction. Making it apparent that I do not post things without a reason, once more.

Yeah, and as far as what an Ecco action figure could "do".....you could have ones that are poseable, and make sounds like Sonar said, which is a really cool idea. How about this? Ya could have 'em where they could come as battle sets or something...Ecco and a figure of a Clan dolphin in one pack...where ecco could have that mark on his flank, and another package where Ecco could come with the Labour Harness and a figure of a Mover, Circle, or Crimson dolphin.....or one of all three in a jumbo pack. Maybe have a pack with a regular Ecco and say....another 'phin of some kind and a turtle? Or maybe a ray or shark? I'd buy toys like THAT in a heartbeat! And how about ornate stands? Where you could stick the figures to display 'em? Something maybe that is molded to look like water, or the ocean floor, or coral reef. There could be slots or something where you could sit your figures to display 'em...that would be cool....*keeps on dreamin'* sigh...........

I intend to challenge your Cousteau post.  Man hasn't always gotten the best of the sperm whales as an incident from 1820 shows: The whaling ship Essex was in the South Pacific on November 20th of that year. She was three months out of Nantucket Island and the voyage had so far been very successful. A thousand barrels of oil had been collected from whales already and the ship was half-filled. The crew was beginning to anticipate a quick trip home with high profits. They were very wrong. By eight o'clock that morning spouts had been spotted on the horizon. The captain brought the Essex, a 238-ton ship to a stop and 18 of the crew took to three long boats to start the attack. The steward and cabin boy were left on board. The captain, George Pollard, took charge of one boat; the first mate, Owen Chase, took charge of the second; and the second mate, Matthew Joy, handled the final boat. Each boat rowed toward the school of sperm whales and picked out a target. Chase's boat attacked first. The boat carefully came in beside the prey. After the harpoon was thrown, the boat was turned quickly away to try and avoid the thrashing tail of the injured creature. The whale unexpectedly changed course and its flukes hit the boat, knocking a hole in it. The crew let the whale go, and rowed back to the Essex to make repairs. After hoisting the boat aboard, Chase noticed a large sperm whale had left the school and was lying off the bow of the ship. Chase was amazed when the animal suddenly started swimming toward the vessel at full speed. The whale struck the Essex with its head just behind the bow. "The ship brought up as suddenly and violently as if she had struck a rock and trembled for a few minutes like a leaf," recalled Chase. "We looked at each other with perfect amazement, deprived almost of the power of speech." The whale had smashed through the bulkhead and the ship was leaking badly. Chase set the crew to work on the pumps and signaled the other boats to return immediately. The whale, meanwhile, had moved off some distance and was apparently badly injured. It was leaping and twisting in convulsions, beating the water around it to foam. Then suddenly the animal was racing toward the ship again, its head high above the water like a battering ram. It hit, stoving in the port side of the ship. The Essex was doomed. The whale disappeared, probably fatally wounded. The crew threw all the supplies it could into the remaining long boats and abandoned ship. A few minutes later the Essex rolled on its side. The other two boats had successfully killed and secured two whales when they noticed that the ship had disappeared. Cutting the whales free, the boats rowed back to where they'd left the ship. The captain was speechless as Chase told him what had happened. The situation was desperate. They were thousands of miles away from land in three light boats. The captain ordered that the masts of the ship be chopped away so they could right the vessel long enough to get some food off her. After salvaging everything they could, the boats headed east. Several of the crew starved during the trip. Two were left on Henderson Island, an isolated and barren piece of land, in order to raise the chances of the others surviving to reach civilization. The boats got separated in a storm and on February 15th Chase's group was rescued by the ship Indian of London. Captain Pollard's boat reached the Island of Santa Maria off of Chile on February 23rd. The third boat disappeared and was never heard from again. A ship was sent to Henderson Island and the two crew left there were rescued on April 5th. It is assumed the surviving crewmembers had learned a healthy respect for the power of the sperm whale.

According to Clive Cussler in Atlantis Found Atlantis is Antarctica. Of course, this book also includes a Neo-Nazi take over of Argentina, The retirement (is that right?) of Queen Elizabeth II, and a very different Antlantean civilization.   Not to mention Hitler's ashes being flushed down a toilet :)I have also seen (an animated) movie where Atlantis is reffered to as 'The-City-That-Man-Built,' which has the Statue of Liberty in it, and the colloseum, I believe.

Tethys you need to get out more, your "romance" novel probably wasn't even romance, it was probably fantasy or whatever, which always includes sex because everyone wishes they could get some and everyone likes hearing about how other fake people fare in the bedroom or wherever their choice place is...It wasn't fantasy.  It took place in the medieval times or something, I'm not sure, it didn't say, but that's how it seemed.  But it wasn't fantasy, it didn't have any fantasy elements in it.  And it was more about the two characters falling in love and stuff than anything else.Like I said, that's the only romance novel I ever read.  I didn't even know it was a romance novel when I bought it, I can't remember what section it was in.  In fact, before reading that book, I didn't even know romance novels were graphic like that.  I never had any desire to read one before.

Well, I never read that book, but I knew it exsisted and I knew it was called The Two Towers.  Even if it weren't for the fact that my best friend is a huge Tolkien fan, you still see the books in stores all the time.  Before and after the movie came out, bookstores, or at least Waldenbooks, had all the Lord of the Rings books right out front.  It seems whoever wrote this petition didn't know the book was titled The Two Towers.  He/she said the director decided to name the movie The Two Towers.  But I can't imagine that there would be anyone who's never heard of the Lord of the Rings before the movie came out, but I guess there must have been, and they apparantly don't realize it's based off of 4 books (there's 4, right?).  They recently released versians of the books have pictures from the movie on the covers, so even if they saw them they probably think the book is based off the movie.  But even if these people are so naive, they shouldn't be provoked by a title that doesn't even have any negative connotations.  It's called the Two Towers, not the Twin Towers.  And even so, even if there was a movie with a name like that which was actually a reference to the WTC, it shouldn't automatically be considered a bad thing.  It could be a tribute, an honor.  And what happens when they make a movie that's actually based off 9-11?  Will morons such as these attack it?

So them vortexies are freaking you out, huh? Well I have the TOT genesis game and the vortex queen has her hive in the water instead of space as in the first one. So I just thought that might explain why the New Machine and the Vortex Queen are in the water and not in a building. (well maybe a mechanical building of foil and steel

How does a dolphin masturbate? x.O;; On the other hand...maybe that's best left unanswered...Well, dolphins are similar to humans in many respects.  First of all, there's the intelligence, which we all know.  Then there's the...sex thing..But they also beat each other up and stuff.  Older dolphins pick on younger dolphins, sometimes they'll surround a dolphin that's a different species and beat it up...And males will kidnap females so that no other males can mate with her.  I saw all of this on some show that was about the "darker side" of dolphins.  They can be just as cruel as humans.

There's two major problems with the Bible.1) It was written in Arabic, and when it was translated they messed up a lot of things.  For example, the part where Moses had horns, but it was actually supposed to be a halo, and they messed it up because the Arabic word for "horns" and "halo" are similar.  2) Most of the stuff in the Bible don't apply to today's world.  And yet people try to make it work for present times, but it just doesn't because it's so old.3) (Okay I lied when I said 2 problems) Because a lot was mistranslated and because a lot of it doesn't apply to the present, everything the Bible says can be interpreted in any one ofhundreds of thousands of ways, which is why there's so many branches of Christianity.  I think it's quite ironic that there should be conflict between Christians and Jews when Christianity is based off Judaeism (however it's spelled).  And then Islam is based off both.  And yet each one says the others are wrong.  Even different branches accuse each other of being wrong, even tho they beleive the same thing.  If you ask me, it's all very messed up.  We should just go back to the Olympians gods.  Or maybe we should all convert to Confucionism, then we wouldn't even have to worry about a god.Organized religion is overrated, but it's still important to beleive in something.

One more thing...In the X-Files, that alien space craft has all the original words from every single holy book in existance written on it in the original languages.  It had the Bible in Arabic, and I think in English, too, for example, along with the Quran and other such writings.  They didn't say this, but I get the idea they're implying that the aliens actually wrote all these things originally and that what we think of as God is actually the aliens.  It was probably some sort of experiment, or their idea of a big joke.  I figure, assuming this is true (and I'm not saying I actually believe this, but you never know, and it's interesting to think about it either way), that when all those prophets heard "the voice of God" it was probably some alien telling them all that stuff.  This goes along quite well with the theory, also supported by the X-Files to an extent (tho it's also another thing they never actually said), that the human race was really created by aliens as some sort of expirement.  Makes sense to me.  I'm not sure I really beleive all that, but as my signature says "anything is possible." I like to keep my mind open.That brings another point to mind.  Organized religions, especially the major monotheistic religions (Christianity most of all, as far as I'm concerned), generally cause people to be very closed minded.  They refuse to think in any other way.  They won't accept any other ideas.Obviously this is one subject I always have a lot to say about, so I better shutup at this point before I think of more to say.

they couldnt change the game anyways the guy incharge of ecco for genesis was ed annuziatta and he doesnt work for sega or appaloosa anymore. all i can say was the only reaosn why the sega cd was different from the genesis or stuff like that was cause ed wanted to add in the things he left out.and the guy i talked to who was working with sega on releasing the smash pack had nothing to do with the older ecco's most of those people have moved on to other things.rumor has it though ed annuziattas gonna get rights back to ecco but thats only my guess ;)

naw i think this topics fine. i will be flat out i don't belive in god or the bible. i agree that the bible is an important book of stories you can learn from as much as i believe spiderman is a series of comics with new adventures and follys.but i'll be flat out and everyone read! i kinda think if i remember the bible was nothing more of a collection of stories from different cultures but the stories were modified and changed. like the story of noah is mentioned in the story of gilgamesh but in that story hes known as utapistim an immortal who the "gods" chose to survive the great flood.i heard big stories that noahs ark was modified and changed to instead of being a story with mans gods it became a story of one god to help probably convert the people whos culture had that story.i don't belive in heaven or hell eithier. theres no such thing as a placefilled with everlasting peace. people learn more form there own miseries and losses and  with that it teaches them to become better.i dont think theres nothing wrong with the ways of "evil" and dont believe in a world without it. good and evil have a balance and if ones taken away we will cease to exist. im kinda tired right now but trie to udnerstand what im saying ;)

(Note: This is the OT forum after all. So far this topic hasn't degenerated into a massive flamewar, so far people seem to be sticking to supported opinions rather than disolving into ad hominim attacks like most religious discussions.)Its been said that if you don't belive in something, you'll fall for anything. Personally, I pick to belive in myself. I'm not really interested in things that happened before about 13-15 million years ago. ;)  Doubt I'll be too interested in what happens after I rejoin the carbon/nitrogen cycle either.

Actually, Atlantis is mentioned in almost every known religeous culture around the world, all depicting a story of it from they're point of view. The greeks warped it the most, saying that Possidon created Atlantis for (one of) his wives, they city had an endless supply of water and food. When Possidons wife bore him sons, they where all given a kingdom and a part of the island to rule over. Then the city became corrupt with greed and power. The gods became jealous of this, and had enough. Some say that a great tidal wave swallowed the island, others say that it was a raging storm that split the island in two and caused it to sink, whilst the most believed was that it was a volcano that covered the island's city with its hot lava and encased it beneath. It's location, however, was never known - hence the reason people from around the world think that it's in different places (ie. Antarctica, A bridge between Europe and North America, etc.) And yes, during the time of the Nazi's, they went looking for the lost city - hoping to find it and use it to take over. There are enough stories to make one's head spin and fall to the ground. However, there is one story to atlantis that I think is the most accurate. They where the mother race of all our earth, like a tower of babal and culture thrown into one. *yawns* Historian signing off ^_^ ~Cally

I don't believe in god. I'm a pagan - so I believe in many gods. I still enjoy reading the bible though, as I think its nice that people can have something to preech about, and to believe in :) I don't discriminate against other religions luckily. But I wish that it could be the same around the world with everyone else. The middle east violence currently going on is one example that people, whom are almost of the same skin, and yet are both the same religion are fighting against eachother? It's confusing to think that such a thing could happen. And now they've even attacked the church of the nativity. *tsktsk*

They also have a lowest common form of communication; biting (raking)do lesiban dolphins 'lick the carpet" eh?lol. No. Dolphins cant exactally extend their tongues or really lick anything anyway.

Yes, it has taken me years after years of research, of wandering sometimes aimlessly and sometimes not even knowing where I am. It has taken countless searches through the greatest databases, it has taken reading the strangest and most poorly designed webpages, by God, it has even forced me to learn Swedish, but... it is done.Here starts the Web//www.comHere ends not only the Web, but the Internet//www.jante.org (här slutar Internet means here ends the Internet)However, my search is not done yet...

well, since all you n00bs are writing fan fics, i thought i would write one that has been floating in my mind for awhile nowits about trellias past as a dolphin. waaaaay back when she was a regular phin in the regualr ocean. basically the story is about how the waters rach the sky and how trellia copes with the change an such. yep, if i told anymore id give it allllll away ;)this is just the 1st chapter, id apriciate some constructive critisism   FYI, this is still a pretty ruff draft, so dont worry about anyspelling mistakes or anything ^^;;;Chapter 1Trellias BeginningTrellia rested on the surface of the water..her body warming in the sunlight. She inhaled deeply and cleared her blowhole. She gazed into the sky, watching small gulls overhead circle in giant loops. Deciding to see what else could amuse her on this hot afternoon she filled her lungs with air, and dove under the waves once more. Slowly, she swam up to a tidal pool close to the waters edge. She sighed and looked blankly into the small puddle...today is going to be a slow one she thought. Her pod had gone out hunting and she had stayed behind. Now she had to entertain herself in the inlet till they got back. She didnt care for hunting that much, usually her pod mates would bring her back something...but shed much rather hunt alone anyways.Trellia was a spirited young dolphin. She was just exiting the stages of calfhood, and learning to become an adult. She wanted to do everything by herself, follow her own rules. No one listened to her, no one understood the true extent of her intellegence. Trellia smiled smugly. She thought about her gift and what her pod leader Celocee had said to her. You have a gift trellia, I have not seen this for a long time. Focus your sonar Trellia, and things will happen. Trellia remeber the first time she tried this....concentrating on a small shell. Her eyes narrowed onto only the shell, harder and harder until she had blocked everythig else from her vison. To her amazement, the shell wabbled and fliped over. She floated, dumfounded by what had just happened. She had first thought it was the tide, but Celocee was just to the left of her, and eyeing this site, she said Well done Trellia and swam off. Celocee was quite a mysterious dolphin. Trellia let out a large bubble and swam towards the surface.A gull called over head. Trellia poked her head out of the water to look at it. The sun glistened off her smooth melon and with a quick pump of her tail, she jumped out of the water towards the gull. She had no intenention of catching it, only scaring the stupid bird. Maybe that would shut it up. With a loud squak, the bird fly backward and almost flipped over and flew away as fast as possible, trying to avoid the delphine body that was so close to its own. Trellias body re-entered the waters and she chuckled ot herself. A stern, yet familiar voice called out. Trellia! she flinched, it was the voice of her father, Dakom. Trellia, how many times have I told you? Do not harras the gulls! Theyre cranky creatures and the will dive bomb the water, in flocks they are dangerous to a young dolphin! Dakoms large sillhoutte emerged from the murky depths and soon she was face-to-face with her father, who stared at her in an angered, yet concerend manner. Trellia had heard this speach a thousand and one times, she siged Yes dad, I know She rolled her eyes, making sure her father didnt see this. Dakom let go a fish he held in his mouth Here, I brought you back a small tuna, your favorite. I think your mother brought you a squid as well.*****Trellia ravenously ate her meal. Her father was right, she did love tuna. She loved the sweet taste of it, she only wished that the pod would go after a full grown one. Her mouth watered in the idea of such a large meal. She took another bite, savouring the soft flesh. Genferna, her mother, ate beside her. She chewed on a flounder. Trellia watched her mother as she tore through the tough skin. Trellia couldnt understand how her mother could enojoy such a bitter fish. Trellia shrugged and started on her squid.So I hear you were tormenting the birds today said her mother. Trellias face grew red Umm...no, I just wanted to see how high I could jump and the bird was in the way Genferna laughed. Trellia, dont feel ashamed. When I was your age, I would take the birds right out of the air and drag them under water just to watch them sqwirm as the swam with thier awkward wings to the surface! Genferna laughed. Trellias eyes widenened You-...you did? Really? Genferna nodded, and Trellia began to laugh as well. Trellia preferred the company of her mother. She was much more laid back and was a bit of a trouble maker. Being a lone swimmer as a younger dolphin, she had always been a bit rebelious. Though, her father also was a lone swimmer, he had clung to the rules his pod had taught him before he had been exiled.After she had finished eating, she watched as the adults went off to the cavern as the children liked to call it. Every everning, the older dolphins would go to a small rock face where they discussed the days work and helped each other solve problems. Trellia was old enough to attend, but she didnt want to. The idea bored her. Instead, she decided to go rest in the clear waters of the sea grass shallows.She slowly swam to reach her favortie spot, unknown by most others. Past the rock cliff where she pod lived, to the patch of sandy beach. There, she gently pumped her tail and jumped over a small sand bar into a shallow area of water that had been in the sun all day. As soon as the warm water touched her rubbery skin, Trellia felt as if she was in a dream like state. Her eyes drooped and her breathing slowed. She rested on the bottom, with only her blowhole above the water. The stubby seagrass tickled her flukes and she inhaled the salty air. She rested her eyes and dreamed...dreamed of where her pod was taking her on the next full moon. Her mothers words melted through her mind and she made a mental picture of it...We are going to the warm seas. The tide is always high enough to stay inland and there is a bay there, the most beautiful bay of all. There, our pod will live in perfect life in the clear waters untouched by man. The sharks stay away and the mens machines cant funcition in the sandy waters. The fish there, they are more beautiful than sunsets and have more colours pakced in one little scale than the iridesnse of a deep sea jellyfish. The trees shade us in the heat, and the sun warms us in the coolness of the morning. Everything will be perfect.Trellia sighed and immereced herself in this dreamland. She opened her eyes to watch the sun set...Fish more beutiful than this? she thought. She couldnt wait to see theese incredible animals.Trellia felt a tiny pinch in her tail. She whistled softly and whirred around to see a small crab was walking on her, a cleaning off some algea on her back. Silly crab she thought. She shook it off gently and nudged it under a rock with her nose. Now stay there she said with a smile. She turned and watched the last of the sunset, then with a small leap, she headed home.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~what do ya think? :D

ill give you more XD 2nd chapter fo y'all =) i warn you, the end of the chapter ends abruplty, im working on chpt 3 &gt;:]Chapter 2The LightAs Trellia returned home, the sun set. She poked her head out above the calm waves to look at the large moon. Almost full moon, she said with a smile. She knew that any day now, her and the pod would swim to those oh-so-beautiful warm waters. As she reached closer and closer to her family, she head a faint moan behind her. She turned around quickly and using her sonar, scanned the area for movements. Nothing, not even a school of fish or a moray eel hidden in the rock face. Her mind raced. What if it was a shark? she thought. Her heart quickened in thought of a sharp-toothed predator. Her mind strayed. Maybe she should look around...after all, what if it was a dolphin in trouble? That would make more sense, sharks dont moan. Her eyes raced and her sonar checked the area all around her. She sent out a few clicks. Still, nothing. Maybe she had imagined it. She shook her head and flailed her flukes to turn around, and she went home without further interuption.When she got back, her mother greeted her. With a warm smile, they greeted each other and rubbed thier melons together. She said Only a few more tides, then we are off to paradise she said with a tilt of her head. Trellia looked up and thought pensively. She thought I wonder if we will still be able to see the moon for paradise. She wondered where this place was, none of the dolphins spoke of where it was located... maybe we would swim into the sky, and stay by the moon and enjoy its warmth all day she said, laughing at her own sillyness. She stared at the round, glowing orb in the sky. She imagined the myths of swimmers who swam among the stars. She closed her eyes and imagined herself swimming effortlessly in the sky. Its beautiful isnt it? Said Genferna. Trellia opened her eyes quickly and nodded, noticing only for a second that her mother also had her eyes closed and was probably imagining the same thing as Trellia. She looked back up at the moon, mezmorized by it.Two young calves played close to thier mothers under the moon light. Thier small bodies broke the surface of the water and the light from the moon brought out the tones of green blue in thier skin. They let out high pitched whistles of joy as the lept, and trails of bubbles folowed as they chased each other in a child-like manner. Trellia remembered the day when she was a calf, so young and foolish. Yet she longed for theese times again. She looked up again as the dolphins leapt in the air. The moon. She loved it so. She could not take her eyes off of it. Its sheer beauty brought shiveres up her spine. She could not beleive how much light it gave off. She wished she could swim among the stars like the dolphins in the myths. Staring at the moon, and listeneing to the giggles of the small calfs, she noticed a chage. She blinked. No, it could not be true. She stared harder into the moon and turned her head one way to focus on it more clearly. What was this? Was it-..yes! It was hapenning! This was not an illusion! There was a small beam of light comming from the sky, it was passing through the middle of the moon. But what was this? She sqwaked loudly. What if this was another one fo the human air crafts? What if it was using its large light to capture more of her pod? Only a few tides ago, man had come close to the inlet and had stolen a few of her pod mates, using a giant machine that hummed like a winged insect. A bright light came from it, it followed the dolphins in the water, like a giant eye. And when the light was fixed on a dolphin, they were snatched out of the ocean like fish in a pelicans beak. She never saw those dolphins again, they did not return from the hunt.She let out a whistle of distress and stared, gaping at the light that seemed to be growing bigger and aproaching the ocean water. Her mother swam to her side, followed closely by Dakom. Genferna squinted. What is it Trellia? she asked soothingly. Trellia pointed her beack at the moon, being unable to speak. She gasped What is this? Genferna said, distress rising in her voice. Trellia screamed Mother! its another one of the human flying contraptions! Theyre coming after us again! Dakom spoke slowly No, the humans cannot make lights so bright. And the light has not reached the water yet. You know what the light on thier mechanical birds look like? No, thats not it, its something...else. Trellia looked wide-eyed at him. Dakom called out in a low-picthced squwak again and again for the rest of the pod to come to the waters surface. The pod members swam up. Celocee stuck her rounded melon out of the waters. Dakom, what is this? She said. Dakom just stayed frozen. Look! cried one of the children Its reaching the water! several dolphins whisteled in amamzement, some older dolphins called out It is Dolphinus! She is taking us home! Trellia turned from looking at them, just in time to see the light spread over the vast ocean. The moan she had heard earylier, it reached her ears and filled her senses. It became louder as the light reached closer and closer to where he pod were watching.~~~~~~BUWHAHAHA! XD

They used to fly these nap-of-the-earth (less than 400 feet above ground) near where I grew up. Theres few things more neat that a huge strategic bomber cruising down a canyon at 500MPH a few hundred feet off the ground.http//www.dolphinparadise.net/dolphin/05_10_2002-20_58_38.jpg(odd enough, the flight profile feels alot like what a swing-wing boeing 747 would feel like, though in this case the 30,000 pounds in the plane's midsection happens to be a mix of SRAM/ALCM rather than passengers.  )

Ok, this is more or less a gigantic spoiler of book 2 of the whitefin trilogy. This is the very last part of the second book. Its only things about the past, so you don't have to panic about the main storyline being ruined. This also isn't the finalized version, things will undoutably change.The Destruction of AtlantisThe streets where flooded with people, running and screaming to get to the shelters. The Vortex had began to attack the great city, they're ships filling the sky and covering the city in darkness. Atlantean soldiers flew up into the skies on they're own ships, bolts of blue lightening being fired at the vortex ships. The vortex where winning...The royal palace shook heavily as blasts cascaded along the ancient building. "Your highnesses, this way! Quickly!" The guards beckoned, trying to move the large family to the royal shelters. "Children! Run ahead, quickly!" Genferna muttered hoarsly as people pushed and shoved around them. Avenirana shook her head "Qwam, Mahtihm!" she shrieked, clinging to one of Genferna's arms. Thirakaga whimpered, looking to the sky, a large blue light hoving above the city with stones around it being her current focus. Dakom gazed over to little Thira and followed her gaze, a sudden feeling of dread forming in the pit of his stomach. "What is it brother-Dakom?" Loreleia asked, looking up at him whilst holding kneeling down and picking up Thira. "The crystal" Dakom uttered. His half blood brother, Cryos, gazed up with him. "It is time.." Cryos said quickly.  Genferna looked horrified. "No! We can't abandon the children like this!" She paled. Loreleia whimpered and gazed down at her beautiful child. Thira was ust like her father, with deep black hair, and his fair skin. Thira got her mother's eyes however, a deep purple with hints of blue. Loreleia could barely stand the thought of leaving her only child, or her niece. Genferna felt the same about her little Aveirana. "We have little time.. The Vortex long to strike us down for good.. we can't afford to not do this" Cryos knelt down and gave his little girl a cuddle. "Take care Thira.." He whispered. "Tabtob?" Thira murmured, looking confused. Avenirana moved away from her mother and to her half-sister, knowing what they where going to do. "They're leaving us Thira!" Avi whimpered. "No!" Thira yealed as her parents, along with her aunt and uncle moved away from them, and into the center of the city square. Around them the city was falling apart, explosions from Atlantean ships smashing into the ground littered the area with blue flashes and hordes of smoke. Avi rushed away from Thira and the city center, heading towards a great machine outside the palace. Thira cried out as she watched the crystal focus a beam of light upon they're loved ones, all of them floating into the skies above and into the great crystal - a mightly shield of blue encasing the inner city. "Mahtihm! Tabtob!" Thira shrieked, as tears fell down her cheeks. Avi saw what had happened too, she let out an almighty wail. The wail echoed off one of the great golden shields of the machine, before bounding onto the other in a repeated process. Avi began to feel the world around her turn into liquid as he body was sucked into the time stream. "Avi!" Thira cried, running to the machine, but it was too late. Thira curled up, an even brighter light erupting from the sky above the city as the mothership of the vortex attacked. Two great beams hit the Northern and Southern parts of the city, a great explosion followed. The shockwave from the attack sent ripples of energy and fire across the outer city, heading towards the inner city and the forcefield. The blast hit the shield and the inner city shook heavilly. The vortex attacked again, but not directly onto the city this time. The beams thrust into the water, creating a massive tidal wave that engulfed everything. The ocean became calm again, and the city was no more.

while i am not that versed in the history of atlantis, nor do i feel i may have any plausible information to give out here... and to avoid the topic dolphin brought up entirely *lol*... i do, however, have the answer to the source of "The-City-That-Man-Built" that artreus mentioned earlier.the animated film was entitled Sampson and Sally, featuring an albino sperm whale seeking out the great Moby Dick in The-City-Man-Built, located under "the waters that burn." this city was almost reminiscent of the ending to the planet of the apes (the old one, of course) with the entire dilapidated city of new york at the bottom of the ocean. this version of atlantis was basically a human city we all know of currently, thereby suggesting that this movie is taking place many, many years from now. ... pretty interesting idea there, too bad it was kind of done already.

Allright, let's get serious... I've read quite a bif of the fiction around here by now, I can give at least a few hints on things you should avoid and on things you should strive for Succinct phrases that sometimes try to sound glorious but usually fail miserably. Think of what would sound natural, or even better, imagine those scenes and the characters in them, and then imagine what they would say. It's a given that a good storywriter needs good imagination.4) Grammar, spelling. They're things that are loathed by every writer since the only impression that can be given through spelling and grammar is negative - if your language is quite correctly formed, it's only what people expected, and you make no impression. Just settle with "no news is good news", or "no impression is a good impression".5) (partly included in point #4) Check what you write. I have (when I have written stories - not to be published here) checked every single paragraph and disciplinedly rewritten each one that I wasn't happy with. This is, again, a matter of personal style - some people might well be able to write a whole story without ever reading back, but don't count on that you would be one of them. Of course, the most important hint is that before you can write, you must be able to read. If you haven't yet done so, read all of vantid's work on this site. Experience from reading novels in English is also a good thing to have, just to be sure.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Something I try to avoid is over using words. For instance, I try to avoid writing "Said so-and-so" or "so-and-so said." On the other hand, I find it annoying trying to find five different words that mean basically the same thing. This is why I don't like using casual dialogues. As said before, you have to give the reader some impression on what the scene is like, they can't see what you see. And Ari makes a good point, you should try reading what's already here to find out what has worked, and what hasn't.

<br />

<div id='container'>
As an example of what Artreus pointed in that last post, saying "I try to avoid" twice in a row is acceptable but should be avoided whenever possible anyway.On the issue of finding five different words for the same thing... Even masters use synonym dictionaries. In the writing project that I have "underway" (it's progressing at about the speed of half a paragraph per day, meaning that it will probably be published within the next few years - and it's a short story...) I use just a normal Finnish-English dictionary, and it's working finely for me. However, thanks to the marvels of the great amount of dialectical variation and homonyms of Finnish, I have to be very careful if I'm not completely sure of the meaning of the words I use...

The Song of the Rising... (one of the better pieces of fanfic on this site)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
OK, well almost. One of the problems I have encountered in the Final Part is the addition of a new character. Her character is not in question, just the name. Most of the other characters had names before they were even written in. This new character is a she and is described in Part2 as 'an unknown singer in the shadows.' This character has caused me problems, because any name I chose didn't fit her, or (in some cases) became a pain to write.In the pre-draft (Written on paper, in school because I was bored) I gave her the name Pyana (Pay-anna)When typed out it became Tendira (Ten-Deera) and was later changed to Araleena, which is, (as mentioned) a pain to type over and over and as the story went on really didn't suit her.You do not need any knowledge of the events in the story because her description in Part2 (as seen above) is all that is written about her.Just thought I'd throw this out there.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
... and just one thing I noticed when letting my critic's eye float over the fanfics of this site. Forgetting it is an unforgivable error, although when it is done correctly it is yet again only a thing that is expected from every writer. It's quite simple to do and doesn't require much more effort than a few presses of the enter key when you move on to some other place or time in your story.Paragraphs.Personally, I simply won't read stories - or, in fact, any texts - that don't have paragraphs or in which paragraphs are grossly misused. It's simply too exhausting. You have to keep a finger (or a browser window's top)  on the line you last read if you only want to do something so little as to move your eyes away from the text without forgetting which line you were on. With a simple division of paragraphs it's much easier to orient and take pauses every once in a while. Besides, paragraphs are a very simple way of dividing information into little packets, and in fact make writing easier since you don't have to keep big amounts of state in your head at the same time.

In relation to the Atlantis thing, i have another fictional version.  Well, they're all fictional, even if it was real I doubt any of the ideas people have aboutit are correct.  But, I mean, it's from a book.  Actually, I just remembered one from a movie, too.I think the movie was called "Escape from Atlantis" or something like that.  I thought it was kind of a cool movie, but not great.  Anyway, two kids and their father get sucked up into the Bermuda Triangle and end up in Atlantis.  They had medieval type weapons, there was one short scene with a unicorn...I can't remember much aout it.  But it was kinda weird.  And in the end when they finally got out they ended up in Stonehenge, so they were saying those were both portals or something.In the first book of The Pendragon Cycle, Taliesin, it talked about Atlantis.  According to the author, Merlin's mother was Charis, a princess of Atlantis (it's called Taliesin because that's his father's name in these books).  They worshipped gods similar to the Celtic gods.  And Atlantis was not a city, it was an island that was seperated into different nations, I think.  I can't remember if there was more than one nation, or if it was just one country.  In the book, a huge volcano erupted caused the island to crumble and sink slowly into the ocean.  They tried to escape on boats, but only two boats made it to Britian, and they landed in different parts of the island so neither one knew the other survived.  After they established themselves there, the Britons started calling them Fair Folk, and they thought they had special powers.  They were called that because they were more beutiful than anyone else.  And they lived really long lives and never aged, which is why the Britons thought they had magical powers.  I had heard of Fair Folk before, but all I know about the legends is that they were thought to have special powers and that that's where the word Faery comes from.  So Stephen R. Lawhead just kinda combined the Fair Folk legends with the Atlantis legend.Yeah...so...what was this topic about again?  Oh yeah, Ecco as a human.  Ummm...I have no comment on that idea.

About the "said" thing.  One thing I do is something that can probably only be pulled off if you have only two people talking.  First, I start off where one character says one thing, and I have to establish who said it.  Then the next character speaks and I establish who said the second thing.  then, after that, you can just alternate between characters in a dialouge without saying who said what.  After you've established who said something, then if there's only one other character it's obviouse that the next line of dialouge was not the same as the person who spoke previously.  example:"Hey there," Jane said."What's up?" asked Joe."Nothin' much.  You?""Same here."In the third line you know that Jane is talking because there are only two characters and Joe just spoke.Wow, I sound like a text book or something.Another thing about dialouge, and I hate it when people don't do this.  Always make a new paragraph whenever a different character talks, even if they say just one sentance or one word.  It makes it a lot easier to distinguish who's talking.  Oh, and just one more thing I want to say.  Make the dialouge sound natuaral.  Don't apply the same rules that you use when writing a report or something.  The only rules you have for dialouge is punctuation.  People don't use perfect english when they talk.  For example, you won't hear anybody say "I do not know."  Instead you could just write "Dunno."

<div id='container'>
I try to alternate dialouge, but sometimes I feel it's gone on too long to remember who's saying what. (How many books have I read where I get the two mixed up) It also makes it appear quick. Short phrases are OK, but if they get to long, and there is little in between, it greatly reduces the implied amount of time between the two phrases. Maybe that's just me oopsevil:

Eveyone can beleive what they want.  What I should have said is that in my experience a lot of Christians tend to be pretty close-minded, but that is just what I've observed even from people I know, but I admit my opinion might be a bit biased.Well, here's what I beleive.  I beleive there is a god or something like it, and I beleive their is an afterlife.  But I think that all religions are really just versians of the same thing, that all the different gods are really just various aspects of the same one god, or that maybe there are many gods but monotheistic religions just take all of them and put them togetehr as one being.  And it's not necessarily how most people think of god, it may just simply be a powerful entity which created the universe and the life in it.  And heaven and hell are whatever you make them out to be--heaven is whatever you want it to be and hell is whatever you fear most.  And that where you end up or if you even experience an after life depends on yourself, on what you beleive.  It's pretty complicated.  Basically I think everyone is partially right in one way or another.Either that or the human race was created by aliens.

Actually dolphins and whales can make squeaks in different pitches and tones, and they all mean something different.  I saw a show where they were studying the "language" of dolphins and whales and trying to interpret it.And I think that they actually use some gestures, such as rolling over and whatever.  I can't remember if I actually heard that somewhere, maybe I'm just making it up.They only animals that can really use facial expressions are apes, monkeys, and humans.  So you can't really use that as an example to say they can't communicate the same way other animals do.And think about it.  Humans do a lot of touching, too.  Touching is a really big part of communicating for us, even if we don't think about it that way.  Dolphins probably don't use touch any more than we do, I'm speculating.  We're a very touchy-feely species.  And we don't lack other means of communication.  So that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it.

Now, what I want to know, is why the college board, who writes the Euro exam, thinks we need to know that in the 50's, France tried to ban Coca-Cola, I'm I missing something here?lol, that's funnyHmm...German and French?  I took oly one language for a good reason.  I'd probably mix them up all the time if I took two languages, or more.  But I wouldn't mind learning French.  It will probably be pretty easy for me now, because it's very similar to Spanish.  At least in writing.  That's another thing, learning one language gives you an advantage when you want to learn another language in the future, especially if it's in the same class, like French and Spanish.  They're both Latin-based.  English and German are both Germanic languages, but as far as I can tell they're nothing alike except for the way things are pronounced.

Tu-160 "Blackjack" Neat. Wonder what the RCS is like on one of those. for some reason the RCS on the Lancer is really low, though it kinda makes sense for a 12 or 6 aspect with full swept-back.I have the unique opertunity of being sandwiched between atleast 5 active militarty aerodromes. Closest is a USMC training center, so lots of rotortrash, though they used to have a few AV-8Bs out here as well. March has been converted down to an ARB, so its mostly just galaxy transports and other things like that.  Miramar is still active but its nearly all F/A-18 flights these days.  Nellis/China Lake/Barstow/Edwards I dunno what they're up to, they don't do low flights over this area anymore, atleast not like they did in the cold war era.

Of course Linux is versatile. I have to say, though, that even I didn't know until yesterday that it runs on Playstation 2 ( http//www.m17n.org/linux-sh/dreamcast/distribution ). Of course, for me a higher priority would be to find an emulator that can run gaming consoles on Linux... (I have actually found several of them - look a bit back in this thread - but due to some problem that I can't quite understand they don't work. It might be a wrong graphics card. It might be an SDL version incompatibility. It might be... anything)Phosismrgreen Welcome to the Community. Enjoy your stay, and make us enjoy your stay :).

Phosis probably means that he was much happier with Ed Annunziata writing the game than with David Brin..Knowing his style, it could well be what we call job security. That is, dr. Brin tends to leave everything so open-ended that few of his stories really come to a real end. I know that after reading the three novels of the second Uplift trilogy and the novella of happenings after them... no end in sight   (...) The bright, bluish light of Garth's sun was disconcerting. (...)p.614:   Tension built as the armada advanced closer to the system's modest  yellow sun. (...)

In the Nauticus Museum in Norfolk, VA, they have a jukebox containing various whale songs, including the Blue Whale.

Italian too. The're all romance languages (Or Latin-based, take your pick) Listening to someone speaking Italian, I can pick out the meaning of about half the words based on my knowlegde of Spanish, and from about the 20 French words I picked up along the way.The German and French thing are true, however. There are a few people in my Spanish class who get confused occasionally because they're still thinking German.  Where did I put my fanfic?  :|

Eao, you're already in there, I renamed you Surina.  Naw, just kidding, the ideas that went into her character are at least two years old, before I even knew of this site's existance. (And actually maybe even before its existance)What I needed help on was naming the new character. If a name is sugested that I feel fits her, it would be used in SoR and therefore the contributer would be a part of writing the trilogy (Or is it now a tetralogy with a prelude?   whatever)I would not object to the idea of crossing over between the forum and my fanfics, just not in this one. Your character is very unique, Eao, and would do well in a story. So I'll add that to my to-do list.  -SoR: Part3 (priorty)  -Tides of Time Fanfic (second priority)  -Part2 Calvin vs Artreus (comic)  -SoR comic  -Another fanfic  -another comic against D12(maybe)  -Orca sketch  -'Magic' cards for hoax section  -Anciet's Song (sonnet(poem))  -Star Dagger (Fanfic, not for here)*-Cross over forum characters in fanfic* 8O I better start working.*Scribbles frantically on arm*

Dunno about the Tu-180. Its certainly posible.I figure the head-on/tail-on RCS for the Lancer/Blackjack/Backfire is all about the same, most blended wing aircraft have about the same RCS.the part where RCS gets you in deep trouble is what your RCS looks like in a look-up slant range, rather than the head-on, since thats what IADS sees.  Dunno about side-on RCS either, though in an A/A situation, you'd be notching.

Never mind that the GBA isn't anything special. Nor is GameCube, dreamcast, or any other system that sega or nintendo put out in the last two years.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i can't relly understand the question your asking but i'll trie to answer.First the question - Why are the Dolphin's prasing Ecco when they had no idea what his quest was. Ecco traveled to alternate versions of time and through them met alternate versions of his friends from his normal time. what probably happened was when time collided they had knowledge of what happened and how ecco saved them.for example it seemd when ecco found traits in mans nightmare they felt the traits and began to think. what that probably did was help them udnerstand more of themselves.each time ecco saved time a time vortex wouild happen and a vortex you can picture is a whirlpool of everything changing around him. each time ecco would saved one world he caused a vortex to open changing everything aroundf him and transforming it. so as it trasnformed every creature had probably a memory of it but when there world was restored they knew it was ecco as he helped change the many alternate worlds.hard to expalin but trie to picturte what i mean.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
welcome back cerebro havent seen you in a while! kinda wodnered what happened to you since you been talking about all the choas thats been gonig on in your country anyhow welcome back./
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Woah! That's really interesting, Tethys. Ummm...about the Ecco as a human idea...I was thinking it might be spiffy if you sort of made Ecco not really like, ALL human. Sort of like human/dolphin. That way, it wouldn't be too far-fetched. Like it was mentioned before, sort of like a human with dolphin traits. And maybe make them have dolphin features, too. I don't know, just an idea.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was thinking of it a bit more. Ecco could have been altered somehow from his stranding in time, and thrown back, millions of years to atlantis. He would be human, but still retain his powers from the asterite. It would be about him adapting to human ways, and he would have a strange link to singers, without actually being able to communicate with them.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That would be good! Cuz I always wondered if Ecco would have suffered some kind of...uh...'change' from being constantly tossed through time. Would he be, like, trying to save the Atlanteans from being destroyed by the Vortex? (did you have an idea for an alternate alien race?)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes! It would be a strictly for fun fanfic, as I know it would receive High critisism. But, I had many plot twists in mind, with the vortex involved.

Yep, paragraphs are always good. Here's a rule that I go byBla bla bla.Bla.I just prefer to do it that way instead of I tend to keep mine casual. If anyone here has read the first bits of my story, Chronicles of the Keeper (members.shaw.ca/the_abyss/site_writingintro.html), you'll prob'ly notice that Eclipse has a tendency to 'talk slang', but that's only because her character basically demands that I do that. It depends on your character. You can have a character that 'speaks prose' (IE- "Have you noticed that the sun is like a rosy ball that seems to have been caught in the sky right now?" *or somethin'. I'm not good at writing like that*), but something in that character's personality should make it seem like they should speak that way (like they're very proper, very poetic, and so on). I tend to write casual because most people talk casually. I don't want my characters to sound fake, either.And my big tips?1) Avoid long passages of prose. Like, describing the sunset for about a page using tons of metaphors and similes and so on. After a bit, it starts to sound like you're just showing off. Describe it, yeah, but don't overdo it. It becomes cheesy and usually turns me off of a story. Maybe I'm being single minded here, but it just sounds stupid after a while.2) Don't make anything happen at random. Think of a good reason for something to occur in your story, or don't put it down at all. I don't know if anyone else here has read the Redwall books, but in my opinion Mr. Jacques, for example (while he's a great writer otherwise) has a tendency to overdo this. 3) 'This is going to happen just because I can't think of anything else to happen right now'. Don't write something in that frame of mind. Parts of stories written like that are usually forced, and, if I may be completely honest, usually suck. If you can't think of anything else to happen at the moment, SKIP AHEAD A FEW SCENES and write that. Eventually, you'll think of your filler material. Then you can go back and put it in, and it won't suck.Hmm... that's my two cents!

Ok, so here's the deal...I am looking to open one of those online stores that would put my designs on t-shirts, mugs, mouse pads, hat, ect... Of course, I don't want to open one, if no one is going to buy anything.So I was wondering what kind of things you would want on t-shirts, or mouse pads and stuff? What would you like to be seen on such items? Any ideas, or requests? I just need a get go, to start myself up. So it would be nice if any of you could help out. I'll get a bunch of desings drawn up, then if you guys would like to buy one (on whatever), we could take it from there!So please, let me know! So I can get some stuff started!

I agree with Shadow on that Debian is the best distro... However, as far as I know, it also has the hardest installation. I believe it would make things tad easier for you if you have someone knowledgeable on Linux helping when you are doing the install. Fortunately, after the install, Debian gets very simple and quick to maintain (save the occasional fights with configurations when you're trying to access more features). The only way to actually use Linux powerfully is to know how to use it, and Debian is the distro that teaches you the quickest... It's just that it's a harsh teacher.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I passed it, thanks to having competed in this area before... (the intricacies of Finnish high school culture are infinite)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
dpkg/dselect isn't particularly hard to use. In fact I think theres an option in the new floppies that tells the installer to set up deselect to download a "workstation" set. You do have to know what hardware is in your box but this applies to every distro under the sun.

I really wondered why I was getting a phpBB installation screen when I tried coming here a few hours ago...

I can access www.arkonviox.com without problems from my school's computers but not at all from home...

Provided that they have a clue of what is going on, I might even someday be able to be here with some other browser than Lynx again...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think the problem is related to the e2fs filesystem becoming unservicable.That or CVS isn't being used here. Either way.Its hard to "duplicate" the database since this site doesn't have that much control over the MySQL database stuff.

Well, have it your way, then. Even the best tech support people sometimes have to give in and tell the customers what they want instead of what they need, although I never believed I would find someone who is actually interested in Linux being so hard-headed to not go all the way to real Linux power...In any case, since you're going to install Linux and you have apparently really made your decision on what you want... I'm not really sure on how to do a cd-less install of any kind of Linux, but this is how I think you should begin Throw us all your hardware information. All cards, their model names, CPU information, HD and memory sizes, everything that might be relevant. Device manager is your friend here. This part is included because we really, really do not want you to install wrong drivers and trash everything...4. Tell us what kind of 'net connection you have. If it's a fixed connection through an easily supported network card, you can congratulate yourself since that means I will have to guess less things. If it isn't one, then I don't really know why you are going to install without CDs anyway. I'll elaborate on what to do when you have got to this part...

naw the only reason you had the installation screen was because i was installing it at the time and had some problems. i'm not using my cvs for upgradig like most people should since i don't relly understand it. Anyhow i should have as much as possible restored in the next hour.
</div>

*Glares at Noriko*  What are you doing here? :) naw, J/kYeah, just posting where you can helps let people know who you are... how you think. What also helps is forced commitment. I believe you mentioned earlier that you came to post pics. I came to post my fanfic, in parts. What keeps me working on them is that I post each part as soon as I can, so I don't let them sit around and I lose interest, and the knowledge that at least someone has read them and wants more (At least, that's what I tell myself)

heh i tried to get everyones avatar back up. some of the avatars are old. And poor shadow's avatar i couldnt find so i gavfe him the kitten. there was an easyier way to upgrade but i fucked up the process.Anyhow please mind that alot of the dates on the posts have been fucked up but the posts remain intact.something corrupted the date and time stamps during the process.

<div id='container'>
Interestingly enough, for me Shadow's avatar shows as the correct one, even after a reload...I'd really like to see the kitten ;).

Kinda late for that. I already eradicated it from my profile.

I have some new information out of a new walktrhough i recieved in the mail by luke barret and hopefully this will help you.Level 12 Medium/HardInstrutions:Go through a tunnel or two and talk to the dolphin that is behind the glass, he will start the belt and crushers. Go back and talk to the other dolphins, they will now help you to push your cart further up the track. The cart will be tipped over and rocks will fall onto the belt. Use the switches on the mini rooms to open crushers when rocks go through until you get to the next area.    This next bit kinda sucks, as it's a bit glitchy. Firstly you can use the safety harness to pick up rocks by double tapping and holding and then you put them in a line in the middle of the crusher. Eventually if done right the floor will open up revealing an exit. (Even I didn't know what was happening at this point)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well if your interestedin helping you could help find new information on new ecco games coming out. maybe look for old magazine articles about the ecco the dolphin for 32x. there were plenty of screenshots for that game that don't exist anywhere on the internet.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
next upgrade i'll just save over everything thats old and we won't be forced to have a fucked up forum.What happened was i acidently messed this up then i had to delete everything then i fucked up the upgrade then i erased it all and did the upgrade again then after a long day of trying to get the forum colors back i noticed the dates are all mesed up but thats when i got to the point of not caring =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
man upgrading the forum seemed to just be a watse of time. theres nothing different. anyhow noriko when i upgraded the forum it made your avatar go bye bye. just reuplaod it

the only thing i can say to you its that linux is very very different to windows... (i dunno mac), better to have knowledge about that os; i tryed it on my computer many times, but there is very difficult to use if you dont have idea of programming and that kind of stuff (ex:you have to mount all the disks one by one, like the floppy, the cd, etc.). so be careful and think that its the best os, but if u dont know how to use it, can be a headhache...oh! and remember that there isnt much software for linux, this capitalist word is owned by bill gates and his fucking windows.

So the reasons why you want to migrate to Linux are simply that you're having problems with stability and virii? In that case, I'm not even sure if it's worth trying... Windows can be made and kept pretty stable if you are just careful with your hardware configurations and keep your DLLs straight. Virii can be stopped with proper software (i.e. use a good firewall, an e-mail client that is not Microsoft made, and a virus scanner, and you'll be fine). Then again, the reason why I went to Linux was purely the instability of Windows (though the reason why I'm staying with Linux is different) so maybe you will want to keep on going towards Linux.Since you apparently know a bit less about OSes than I believed, I'll be more basic this time... So, first, a few random snippets of information that is not what makes it hard)-  I really need to know through what media you are going to get Linux. If it's the 'net, then you should really have a flat rate connection - and you should really find out how well your network card/other connection media is supported in Linux. The easy way of doing this is just going to the device manager and extracting the required information for us. If the media you're going to use is not the 'net and not a CD, then things will be tad difficult...

the only thing i can say to you its that linux is very very different to windows... (i dunno mac), better to have knowledge about that os; i tryed it on my computer many times, but there is very difficult to use if you dont have idea of programming and that kind of stuff (exroll all software that can be compiled to work under Linux and is either open-source or has intelligent developers) is also diverse. In any case, there is still less of software for Linux than for Windows, and if you're (* refers to Phosis*) going to install Linux only because you want to go on doing whatever you do with your computer but get rid of the crashes, it's not a good idea. You will have to abdicate.

Nice dragon Trell'! Much better than MY first attempts all those years ago. X3Here's a tip....use anatomy of existing animals as a guide. I used lots of pictures of dinosaur skeletons, birds, bats, and even mammals like the big cats and even dogs as refferences. Just rememeber....each artist draws dragons differently. No two artists see dragons quite the same way. Find a style you like and stick with it. I see way to many ppl force themselves to draw dragons in someone elses style...and it never really works. Once you find a style that you like, expand on it....that's how I learned.  :)

I saw a special on Atlantis a long time ago. But I do remember they were debating on whether or not it was a small island, or a whole continent. Linked to this debate was evidence supporting it was in the Atlantic Ocean, or the Mediteranean Sea.And, correct me if I'm wrong, the Disney movie decided it was near Iceland.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The disney movie of Atlantis aid that there was an illuminated text called the shappards journal, it was a fictional addition they made that was said to be on the southern most continent of iceland, the city however I have no idea where they placed it in the movie. However, In alot of stories about atlantis, its normally reffered to as an Island.. if you dun believe me, take a real good look at Australia :D We're the largest ISLAND in the world.

Though I'm ONCE AGAIN coming into this conversation at the end, I must say a couple things. I haven't played DoF just because I am in love with Ecco and Ecco 2. After what I've heard from people about David Brin fucking it up, I haven't really felt the urge to play DoF. Except...maybe that the graphics are better than the early genesis games.. But for me, I don't really care about graphics too much. I like the first Ecco games...and for some strange and some not-so-strange reasons, too! But we won't get into that. Anyways, sorry if that was random, I just wanted to say that!!! ^__^;;;;;

everytime i add a new page to the site like a new page to fanfare and so on i'm adding a new piece to enigma.Right now i'm working on new sections i want to get a new reviews section up that supports enigma. have you noticed some of the sections that use enigma urls like enigma.php?id=soemthing//arkonviox.com/objects/preview.jpgi'm working slow on progress but i'm trying. this site has alot of sections. and the new developement of sections involves less sections so there wont be alot for peopleto go through.i hope it makes it easier what you can expect is articles-newsreviewsecco the dolphin-ecco the dolphinecco 2 tides of timeecco jr.ecco defender of the futurefeatures-blundercavesall in the familyand so on and so on and so on.basically im making it easier to find something based on the game. if you want information only on ecco one you go to the ecco one section and you will find it. you will find cheats guides and so on for that patucular game.also i hope to make the reviews section more popular since i want more people submitting reviews and i plan on making rewards for it but not yet.i'm trying to gather stuff for my personal life too, i want a new job i met a new girl at work and so on and so on and so on. anyways i want to get it done, i also want to do some more programming work on enigma, noticed some troubled areas i wanted to fix. but as long as the sections are converted to ehtm i'll be closer to finishing.

I'm sorry, I have to agree with Trellia on this. I realise that there are some things in the Bible that may upset some people or whatnot, but that doesn't mean that you can start badmouthing what some people truly believe is real. I don't mean to sound like there's a stick up my ass or anything, but that's just the way it is. If we went around badmouthing everything we didn't whole-heartedly agree with, the world would be a sad, scary place. (Well, even more sick and sad and scary than it already is) There are some things that everyone can agree on and some things that everyone can disagree on,  but when you start bashing religions, that's where I get offended. I'm not saying that you can't have your opinions about things, but please don't express them too strongly if it's at the expense of others. *shushes herself*I'm sorry. Sometimes I...lash out. =pI'm done with my little ranting now. ... I still love you.

Update It's being scraped. Even the name is beind redone. All 10 pages are being torn apart and canibalized. Araleena will still be an important character in the story but, for the time being, will be called Pirra (Peer-a) because it fits better than the last name and is shorter. This could easily change during the re-write, as she becomes more developed, or yet another name is recomended. There that's it. It may take awhile, but this will be completed.

Isn't Greenland bigger than Australia? Or am i just confused?Things that actually sank?  I dunno that there really is anything.  The landbridge between Asia and North America didn't actually sink.  It was only there during the ice age, and the glaciers eroded it away.  The "Atlantis" in South America didn't sink, either.  It's still there.  On the one show where they were talking about it, they showed arial views of it from a helicopter.  It's just some mysterious part of South America where an ancient civilization dissappeared or something, I can't remember what they said about it.  It's not an island, it's part of the mainland.The versian I mentioned from those books, well they didn't actually say where it was but it must have been near Britian somewhere.  But that was a fictional versian.I can't remember where else they were looking for Atlantis on that show, it aired a long time ago.  There was some place in Europe I think that they thought might be it, but it wasn't an island either, and it's still there.  I'm not even sure it was Europe, I might be remembering it wrong.

Hey guys! Been wanting to write somethin' for a long while, but unfortunately, Chronicles of the Keeper just isn't cutting it for me anymore. I don't know if I'll finish it, but for now, it's on hold while I work on a new idea. Since I played the first Ecco and went through the level 'The Library', I've wanted to write a story that sort of told the story of just exactly what happened during the time Atlantis was being attacked by the Vortex. I started it once before and didn't continue it, and now I think I just might. Anyway, this is a little snippet (IE-just to see if I could get you hooked!) I just finished, I wanted to see what you guys might think of the idea. Tentatively, the whole thing'll be called 'Descent'. But anyway, if you have a few minutes, read this and see what you think. I know it isn't much to go on, but don't be afraid to speak up about it.Just for clarification, yes of course, if the thing here was completed, you'd know who all the characters are. For now, just know that the whole thing would center around the dolphin named Esper and the girl Cassandra (since I read the post where Ed A. said Cassandra would have been the person who made the Glyphs for Ecco, I decided to put her in as a crutch for one of the original ideas I had a long time ago!).Enjoy...-----"We have to face it," Auriphus stated grimly. "We're losing this war. If this keeps up, Atlantis will fall very soon. Two or three days, perhaps."His words caused a significant break of silence, a pause in which those in the chamber stared around at each other uncertainly, each waiting for the next to say something to break the quiet. The dolphins in the water flicked their fins for lack of anything else to do, the humans tapped their feet and twiddled their thumbs. Esper glanced up at Cassandra nervously. She smiled back at him, and though he was sure she meant it to be a reassuring gesture, it looked extremely forced, breakable, even. "What d'you expect us to do, then?" The question came from Taluka, whose normally thunderous voice was raised an octave louder in incredulity. "If we don't have Atlantis, we don't have a home!""That I know," Auriphus answered, his deep grey eyes troubled. "But we have no other choice than this: we have to leave Atlantis." He paused for breath and was instantly interrupted by hundreds of voices, both human and dolphin, shouting at him in anger and disbelief."We can't leave!""What'll we do? Where'll we go?""Are you crazy?""This is our home!""Pardon me, council!" Auriphus's voice barely rose above those in the room with him, and he held his hands up for quiet."QUIET!" Taluka's voice produced the required effect; the room was noiseless instantly. He glanced up at Auriphus with a nod. "Continue, Master.""Thank you," the grey haired man said to the big bottlenose with a grateful nod. He turned to address the group in front of him then, his voice level. "It's come to this, Atlanteans. We can not defeat the Vortex on our own. Already we've lost hundreds to those monsters, human and dolphin alike. The odds are stacked heavily against us. Don't you see? If we don't leave, Atlantis falls, and its populace falls with it.""There has to be some other way," came the voice of a middle-aged woman, her black hair tied up in a graceful bun. "Where will we go if we leave?""We'll reach the mainland," Auriphus replied simply. "And from there we'll go anywhere we can survive. The point is, we must go together or not at all.""Unacceptable!" Odessa yelled from where she was settled next to Esper. She thrashed her tail viciously, sending droplets of seawater feet into the air. "We can't let the scum drive us out of our home, Auriphus! They'll have won! And if they win, they take Atlantis, and then they can do what they like with it! This is our home, it took our ancestors their lifetimes to build it, and here we are deserting it like a bunch of craven sea worms!"Voices were raised in agreement with the fierce female dolphin's words, and Auriphus shook his head desperately."Odessa, you're a fighter, that much I know. But some of us are not, and not all of us can defend ourselves. You dolphins already lost your settlement to the east and what, fifty with it?" He shrugged simply. "We send wave after wave of defenders at the Vortex and time after time we lose. They'e machines! They can go on forever, and we cannot. I say what I say now with just as much anger and misery as you receive it with, but the truth remains; Atlantis is losing, and I believe it's time to cut the losses and just... live.""But Sir?" Cassandra's voice cut, surprisingly, across the room. Esper looked up at her in astonishment, amazed she'd chosen to speak. "If we're the last defense against the Vortex then... what happens now that we've lost?"Auriphus sighed audibly. "Perhaps, if we're able to reach our land relatives, we can enlist their help. We can return to Atlantis and finish this. For now, we must concentrate on staying alive so that we can finish this."He fell silent, as did the chamber, for a moment. "We have to retreat to come back," Auriphus finished. "It's as simple as that. But I only have the right to make this decision if you all let me. If you choose to stay then I will, as well." He shrugged again. "I leave it in your hands."Esper looked at the faces of the humans and dolphins around him anxiously, his stomach fluttering. His eye caught Cassandra's, and they stared at each other helplessly."Wait, wait just a minute," came the clipped tone of Antimony from the back of the dolphin pool. She shoved forward through the water, pushing dolphins to her left and right, until she was within seeing distance of Auriphus. "Sir, if I may, might I suggest a... perhaps, a different way of going about this?""By all means," Auriphus answered."What about the Time Machine?"

Aww.... do you know how HARD I looked to find the Seaquest Darwin figure? There was an entire wall of those god damned 'Captain Seaquest' or whatever the frig his name was, but not one Darwin! I was SO PISSED OFF! And I wanted him so much... *sobs*Ecco toys. Ah, that would be the most kick ass thing to come along since Sonic Adventure toys.

Ok here are some facts so we can gey off of the    ual subjects... The Humpback whale differ in the atlantic than they do in the pacific. In the atlantic, thier pectoral flippers are completely white, while in the pacific they are dark blue or gray on the outside, and white in the on the "palm" side of the flipper. Also the Humpback's flipper is 1/3 the length of its entire body! No two Humpbacks are the same, the whites on thier flippers are like the fingerprints that us humans have. Therefore, scientists have been able to record thousands of humpacks in the wild! Male humpbacks are well known to make the most long and complex songs during the mating season! The most complex whale cries known! :o *Why did I have to end it on a    ual note?*

I don't buy stuff online.I would feel weird wearing a t-shirt with someone's art on it.  Unless it was proffessional and they printed it on thousands of t-shirts and sold them in stores and catalogs, like some of the shirts I actually have. Then it doesn't seem so much like artwork.I would feel even weirder wearing a shirt with my own artwork on it.I dunno.  I have no ideas.  Well, you could make shirts with the name of your site on it, using your banner logo or something.Some people can make billions of dollars just by slapping their names on a shirt.

The songs of Humpback whales remain the same all year. Though the song sung by Hawaiian humpbacks is a different song than that of the Carribean Humpbacks, all Humpbacks in the same region are singing the same thing, just at different paces. The song changes every year, thus two songs will sound different, but not as different as two consecutive years. The fact that the songs are so long and complex, and are remembered and modified, proves the immence brain capacity of these giant singers.

I wasn't bashing anything.  It didn't seem to me like anyone was bashing anything here.  The only bashing going on was that stupid petition.  I don't see any reason for anybody to be offended here.  As for me, I was just stating my opinion based on what I've observed.  And when I listed those things that are wrong with the Bible, all that was true.  A lot that's in it simply doesn't apply to today's world, civilization has changed drastically since the time it was originally written.  I had no intention of offending anyone.And I think that people already do go about badmouthing everything.

Having just listened to a record released by National Geographic in its January 1979 issue, I can now say this:When played at 14x its speed, the songs of a Humpback sound remarkably like the songs sung by birds. The whale's abbility to modify the song is unique to Humpbacks and humans.

Like I said, they didn't seem to even KNOW about the book.  They probably never even heard of it.  Whoever wrote that said the DIRECTOR was planning on naming it The Two Towers.  So they don't even realize it's based on a book. Which is really sad, because it's one of the most well-known series of all time and it's been around for ages.

What's ual?Anyway, about what Sonar said, I heard somewhere something like all dolphins and whales, or at least most, have different varieties in the northern oceans than in the southern oceans.  That is to say, for example, the bottlenose dolphins in the North Atlantic are different than those in the South Atlantic.Or, maybe it was the Pacific vs. the Atlantic, rather than North vs. South...I can't really remember.  I'm probably just confused as usual.On some show on I think Discovery or National Geographic or something like that, they showed how whales actually respond to music that humans play.  People would go out on boats or just by the shore and start singing or playing music, and a bunch of whales would start showing up.  it was mostly orcas they were showing.  And sometimes they even started singing along!  At least that's what they were saying.  But they did actually show video tapes of the orcas appearing while a choir was singing or an orchestra was playing.  They think song is the key to communicating with whales, which I think is actually a pretty cool idea if we could figure out how to interpret it.But the stupid part is that they were actually singing songs about cities and other aspects of human civilazation (only the good things, of course).  The whales may enjoy the music and that may even be a way of communicating for them, but it's not like they understand English. Or any human language for that matter.

Aardwolf!  They're related to hyenas.Just a note, I have to say this.  Hyenas are NOT related to dogs.  They are their own family.  Hyenidae, or something, I might have spelled it wrong. It includes the various species of hyenas and aardwolves.Well, I'll give an easier one in case nobody can come up with something that has anything to do with aardwolves.Laughing, cuz, obviously, they sound like their laughing, thus the nickname "laughing hyena". (The real name is spotted hyena).

Okay, I need some ideas here.You see, here's the deal.  I have been working on this RPG thing.  It's really just a game idea, and I wanted to work out as much as I can on it even tho I can't make it into an actual game.  But, you never know, maybe it will be made into a real game someday and be a big hit and I'll make a lot of money.  Well, probably not.  But it's fun anyway, except for when I can't come up with ideas.  For example, I'm having a lot of problems with the story right now.  I can't figure out how to get from point A to point B.Oh, I have a website on it, just because I wanted to share my ideas//members.tripod.com/nueva_pazI'm in the middle of converting it to FrontPage now, but I'm almost done.Anyway, part of the plot is the characters have to go and gather the 6 Crystals of the Elements.  Each of the Crystals is supposed to be gaurded by something, except for the Crystal of Darkness because they have to fight somebody who already took it, and I'm not sure about the Crystal of Light.But here's my dilemma.  I need to figure out WHAT is gaurding each one.  I already know the Crystal of Wind is guarded by a Roc (a giant bird of prey).  And I'm thinking of a Chimaera for the Crystal of Earth--I dunno, somehow it seems to make sense to me.  But I can't think of any mythical creatures to correspond with the elements of water and fire.  Obviously for water it has to be some sort of sea creature, but the only things I can think of that would actually pose a strong threat are the Leviathon, which I don't really want to use because it's a Biblical thing and it's really just a big whale (on the other hand, the Roc is just a giant bird), and the Kracken.  But it would have to be something that can crawl onto land.  And for fire I thought of a dragon, but I already decided dragons would be something you'd come across just in the field and I want this to be something you only fight once.  I also thought of a Phoenix, which would have been perfect, except I already have the Roc and I don't want to use two birds if I can help it.I don't expect anyone to have any ideas of what sorts of creatures I could use, but if anybody knows of anything that might work, it would be helpful.

I really need some ideas from some of you guys! My 3rd chp. of the Darkness won't be in production until about June. 5. I broke my wrist about 9 days ago so i won't be able to write, just type, and even that's sorta hard. So if any of you can send me some ideas for the 3rd story that would be a really great help. If anyone does happen to post an idea that I like and use in my story, then I'll post their name along with mine around somewhere at the bottom. But, thanks to anyone who comes up with an idea for my story! June. 5 is when the cast comes off (Wow)!

i recall this flash from a while ago as well! and it is still as amusing as when i had first watched it... i think it is mainly funny to so many simply because they are doing what so many mario fans would do, try singing the level songs a capella... the dialog in the beginning also contributes to its hilarity as well XD"Yeah, you like that, idiot! I got it, you don't.""Shut up, God damn."... still have to give them credit, they did the water level pretty well. i'm beginning to think that a "mario man" game would actually be a little more likeable than the other one, though.

That is to say, for example, the bottlenose dolphins in the North Atlantic are different than those in the South Atlantic.Or, maybe it was the Pacific vs. the Atlantic, rather than North vs. South...I can't really remember.  I'm probably just confused as usual.Pacifics have some localization that differs from atlantics, mostly size and pigmentation. Same thing appears in most other global distributed species.On some show on I think Discovery or National Geographic or something like that, they showed how whales actually respond to music that humans play.  People would go out on boats or just by the shore and start singing or playing music, and a bunch of whales would start showing up.  it was mostly orcas they were showing.  And sometimes they even started singing along!  At least that's what they were saying.  But they did actually show video tapes of the orcas appearing while a choir was singing or an orchestra was playing.  They think song is the key to communicating with whales, which I think is actually a pretty cool idea if we could figure out how to interpret it.Orcas seem particularly interested in any kind of sounds really. Same for bright colors or any other sort of new and different enviromental. They don't know what it is, so they check it out.Be careful how much of cetacean "vocalizations" you consider to be communications; much of the tone patterns are very simlar to that of pulse or constant-wave ranging/guidance radar.But the stupid part is that they were actually singing songs about cities and other aspects of human civilazation (only the good things, of course).  Sumar likes jazz  :)The whales may enjoy the music and that may even be a way of communicating for them, but it's not like they understand English. Or any human language for that matter.Careful here again. Orcas, pilot whales, and to a lesser extent, bottlenose dolphins all support something called "sentencing"; They can take objects or places and abstract them with a symbol (noun) and an action (verb). These NVN or NNV type sentences can then be formed and executed on an arbitrary basis. Orcas can infact take several of these sentences and will perform them in order with a reasonable degree of accuracy. (dolphins are much more literal and often can only handle one thought at a time.)This is how auditory cueing works, and to my knowledge, most gesture based systems as well. Its also the core of present tense english ;)

Humpbacks will use contractions, They will take a song segment and sing the begining and end, but drop the middle.There are differences in some species between north and south because they don't migrate across the equator and, given enough time, will establish a different gene pool.Along with greetings in 55 different languages from 60 contries, the songs of Humpbacks have been sent into space on the Voyager 1&amp;2 probes. The record inside each has a billion year life expectancy. :? You can always tell on what whale I've learned about most recently.

Ah come on you guys! You don't need a date to go to the prom! And especialy if it's your last year, just go nuts!Prom has this image that you need a date to go, and a pretty dress with nice hair... well I say screw that! Life is hulla' short, so live it up. The model society can go to hell, because it isn't working for any of us anyways.  8)

I think I'll abuse this chance for voicing my opinion to everyone...I DO NOT LIKE THE SPRITES.I almost hate them. If I used IE regularly and spent a long time on the site with it, I would hate them.I generally tend to dislike everything that distracts my attention when I'm looking for information on a webpage... That's why I generally have pop-ups set to popping up on the background (HAIL Opera!) and GIF animation disabled (HAIL Opera!). Fortunately Opera (HAIL!) doesn't usually display those sprites, although when I set it to identify as IE it does try to render them (but does it incorrectly, still HAIL Opera!). All this means that Arkon won't really have to care about my opinion - after all, I don't normally even see those sprites. But still... they're not a sign of technical skill. They're not a sign of giving a good polish to a webpage. They're a sign of an immature webmaster. They give a bad impression. They're definitely not a positive thing for the webpage.

Do you mean, how much does it cost you? Nothing actually. The blank stuff costs about a $1.50-$2.00 less then what I have it at. I don't like a lot of that stuff, so as soon as I make some new things, a lot of those will go.

Thanks for the ideas everyone!I thought about Scylla, but I wasn't sure what she was supposed to look like.  I just know it was actually an island that was personified as a monster because sailors often lost men to its rocky shores, and that Scylla used to be a sea nymph but she was changed into a monster as a punishment of some sort.  There's also Charybdis, which was a whirlpool, but it was also personified as a monster.  They were both in the Odyssey.I've heard of RPGMaker and I would like to get it but I have never seen it in any store and I dunno where to get it.  And besides, even if I had that I could start making the game but I could never finish it as long as I don't know the whole story.  And I have been having the hardest time coming up with ideas.  I don't know if I'll ever finish it.But, did anybody even look at the site? I want to know what people think.

Never heard of anyone going to Prom in 10th grade...Well, I hung out with my best friend and her date and I had a blast!  I even got to dance with my friend's boyfriend.  Nobody else asked me to dance, but that's okay.  I had a lot of fun.  You don't need a date for Prom.  All you need is at least one good friend.  I was hesitant about going, but I figured this was my last chance to go to Prom and it's such a big event.  I loved the dress that I got and my hair turned out really good too.  My friends said I looked good, and they said they were surprised I didn't get a date.  There wasn't really anyone I wanted to go with anyway.  I wasn't the only single person there, but most people were at least with friends.  But none of that matters, because I had a really good time.  That's all that counts.And about money, the tickets were only $15.  Not $200.  My dress was under 100.  So it's not really so bad as far as prices.  I don't see that as a reason to skip out, unless you really can't afford it.  It's worth it.

That's the impression Ari tends to give off  they had the house of Atreus, Artemis, and a whole bunch of other ones that sounded similar.If my memory serves me (which at the moment, it doesn't) the Myceneans conquered the Greeks at one point in time, but that was before the Greeks had much of a civilization, so it doesn't count.

So, are you saying dolphins and whales can understand human languages?  I can't fathom how that could even be possible.  If we can't understand them, how should they be able to understand us?Or maybe that just proves they're smarter than us.A dolphin's brain has twice as many folds in it as a human's.  So that may be true.  Because the folds increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex, which is what seperates us from other animals.  It's what enables us to think as complexly as we do.  A lot of brain functions happens in the cerebral cortex.  I'm pretty sure humans and dolphins (or ceteceans in general I should probably say) are the only animals that have a cerebral cortex.  I know that most animals don't have it, so I'm pretty sure humans and ceteceans re the only animals that do.  I don't think even monkeys and apes have it, but I may be wrong.  I was thinking I heard that before but I tend to mix things up like that a lot.  They at least don't have the folds, I think.

I'll save everyone from the long, boring and really off-topic description of the often contrary female reproductive system of orcinus Orca, since the only other person around here thats interested is NeoEcco.Theres a reasonable posibility that the calf could be Splash's, but for purposes of discussion, its irrelevant for the next 7 to 10 years. (at which point it could become a rather sticky issue. I'll let you figure out why)In other news, I wonder how Shouka is recovering.

Artreus in a nutshell) Many names come to me that way. Artreus was originally used as the name of my Sci-Fi character, Artreus Hayson. Then I discovered this site and felt kinda bad that I didn't have a dolphin character. So I dropped the surname, Stuck a few stripes on my head and came up with the character at left.All of the characters with the title 'Rising' in my fanfic cross over between the two story lines, although Cassiopeia and Orion were developed for SoR first. Though I tied the two stories together nicely, the Sci-Fi fic will never see this site.The worst part about coming up with a good name is knowing the character is doomed to die, such as a few of mine that will remain nameless now.

It's the element of earth, which, at least in my opinion, refers to soil, rocks and minerals, and clay--the stuff that makes up the Earth's crust.  The Dawn of Light doesn't even take place on the planet Earth.  But of course they have...earth. LOL silly, you download it.Oh. ^_^; I didn't realize that.  But how could you download it on PSX?  Well I'd prefer a PC versian anyways.  But first I'll have to find it (I'll try that website later) and then I would have to have sufficient time to dl it, because I assume it will take a long time.  But as I said I could never finish making the game until I know the whole story.  I probably wouldn't be able to make it very good anyway.  And I would imagine it would be a lot of work.

Arty I thought you said you got your name from Greek Mythology or something.As I've said before I did get Tethys from Greek mythology.  Except I didn't know how it was supposed to be pronounced at the time and now that I know I decided that my character's name will continue to be pronounced the way I always thought it was.  When I was trying to come up with a name for her, before she was a Gaurdian, Tethys was the first thing that popped into my mind.  I kept trying to think of better names, and I thought of a few others, but Tethys just kept popping into my mind over and over again.  So I thought the hell with it, I guess she's meant to be called Tethys.A lot of times I'll come up with a name and I'm certain that I made it up. But then I discover it's a real name, or that it was already used somewhere.  So I know I must have heard it somewhere and it stuck in the back of my mind without me realizing it.  Or sometimes it's just something very similar. For example, one of my DoL characters (The Dawn of Light, my dream RPG project) is named Arwynn.  I thought I made it up but then I discovered Arwyn is a real name.  So I must have heard it somewhere.  I was gonna change his name but I realized most people wouldn't know it's a real name anyway and it just doesn't matter,.  And besides, I couldn't think of anything else.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The Greeks came up with 'Artreus' long before I did, but I'm certain I didn't here it before. Probably pronounced very differently though. I don't know anything on Greek prononciation, but my name is a mix of 2, maybe 3 languages. In Spanish, its 'Ar-tray-oos.' In English (At least in my neck of the woods) it wood be 'Ar-tree-us' I mix the two Celina. I havn't put her anywhere, but I found out today there's the name Selina.wink:

So, are you saying dolphins and whales can understand human languages?  I can't fathom how that could even be possible.  If we can't understand them, how should they be able to understand us?Or maybe that just proves they're smarter than us.Orcas are capable of artificial language communication both ways, implicit (same-different classification) and explicit (direct object/noun corolation)Theres also a form of cultural (observational) communication that occurs. Dolphins suffer from low attention spans, which is why most individuals cannot reliably sentence beyond generalized structures (like "repeat") and accuracy dramatically drops off when presented with multiple stimulii.

Bah... next time I will have to read the original post before I reply...

Good god! I have so many reasons why I love Ecco! Where shall I start? Well, first off, I have this strange obsession with sea life.  8O  But that's okay...second, I love videogames! Ecco is both of my passions combined. &gt;.&gt; the next reason is that I think it has a great story plot, characters...everything! I mean....it's so original. Plus...it's practically the only dolphin game out there. (that I know of) another reason is...alright this is kind of a strange reason, but I'll tell you anyways. When I was little(er), I used to play Ecco with my big brother. We would take turns getting through levels and stuff, so whenever I play it, it reminds me of my brother, who isn't around anymore.  That's, like....one of the main reasons. There are a whole lot more, but I'm too lazy to type any more.  :D

Around 11am CDT, May 20th she was in medical quarintine at SFWoA (former SWO). She looks in good spirits despite the flight and having to spend time getting poked and prodded a little.Female orcas along with most other dolphins become mature as young as 6 or 7 years of age. Last thing I can imagine MLF wanting is her to breed with Kim 2. Not to say that it wasn't financially motivated either. I'm sure that Six Flags came up with a good bit of cash as well.I'm not supprised that the Brigitte Bardot Foundation didn't have any weight with the NMFS. While most people in this country knew that SFWoA had a transport permit application for Shouka and Kshamenk for over a year, I don't know how well that information was known outside of the united states. Its also been known that the permit was pretty much a go as of last june. Not to forget that NMFS/NOAA has a bad record of wanting to listen to ARA factions, due to the fact that most ARAs in the US are ill-informed or fronts for terrorist activities.Its likely true that you won't see her again, unless you feel like traveling to Aurora, Ohio. Various federal/international regulations make this as they say, alea iacta est.

I don't know what the APHIS required quarintine time is on an animal with known medical background, but I know its not very long. They'll wanna have her learn the gate order and be able to make transitions before they bring Kshamenk in. (basically because he will spend the full medical quarintine, up to 6 weeks.)*gives Stenellya a pacific whiteside plush and a big hug* roll:

You're nice...I'm lucky to have friends like you...But, Shouka is too young for Kshamenk...You know Shadow, the female orcas begin to have calves between 14 and 15 years. "Shouky" isn't ready to take care of a baby....And, if she has too many stillbirths, she can have problems...Remember Corky...Six dead babies (after, before or duroing the birth)...She stoped ovulating at 25...I love my Shouka so much...

As you might remember, I have spent a good part of my time on this forum wondering what is the actual reason behind that I can't get any of those console emulators to work on my computer. I figured it could have been an SDL (multi-OS almost-equivalent of DirectX) version incompatibility, so I spent some time tinkering with that. No results. I tinkered also a bit with X extensions, and with GTK. No luck. Later then, as a completely unrelated check, I happened to look at the output of my X server when I run it. The installed version appeared to be 3.3.6a.What the flamin' hell?After some consideration, I replaced it by downloading the standard binary installation of XFree86 4.2.0. What fun even that was - fortunately ftp)). The only meaningful keys I have found yet are the cursor keys, A (sonars/maps), Z (pauses) and S (does interesting stuff, apparently). What was the Genesis controller like? Are there other keys of "importance"?And, of course... What else is there that I should know in advance? Any interesting pointers? Or is this one of those games that are best enjoyed if you are just thrown into the world without really much knowledge (save the whole plot, thanks to reading some comics)?

<div id='container'>
Hmm.. Quick research that I could come up without resorting to having to find my binder...  Gudrun (11), Kasatka (12), Kalina (6), Taima (9), Takara (10)You make the presumption that Shouka will cycle this year, and even if she cycles and becomes pregnant immediatly, she won't calve until december 2003/january 2004.Corky2 is a somber reminder that experince is a hard teacher; one recives the test and then the lesson.  Keep in mind that Corky was the first orca to ever have live birth, back in the dark ages when we really didn't know anything about cetacean husbandry, things like the fact that orcas can't nurse for those critical first 48 hours if they have to swim in a tight circle, as was the case with Marineland of the Pacific's round pool.Corky had a total of 7 pregnancies. Interesting to think what things would be like had time been rolled forward 15-20 years eh? She'll be 36 or 38 this year (I don't rember right now)Its been interesting to watch her over the years. Shes quite pair-bonded with Orkid (after all shes genetically related to Orkid and Kayla) and shes been more of a mother for Sumar than Taima ever was.

<br />

<div id='container'>
0o;; Even though I run a macintosh, I use the same setup I used to have on Genecyst when I used a PC. z = a (sonar/map), x = b (super charge), c = c (swim), shift = start.Now if Mac emu's had 6 button controler support, i'd also havea = x, s = y, and d = z (all these buttons have no use in the Ecco games (thankfully).So yeah, like Artreus said, you can simply use 3 fingers, and your other hand on the 'd-pad' (keyb. arrows) for direction :D However, do not be like me, and zoom around at super sonic speed in the game, it hurts your fingers 0o;

I always knew Celina was pronounced with an S sound.  It's also spelled Selena or Selene, and I think there's a couple other spellings, too.As for how Artreus is pronounced, it actually depends.  Greek names almost always have a modern pronunciation and an old pronunciation.  I can guess pretty close the modern pronunciation of Greek names based on the ones I already know.  I would imagine Artreus is pronounced ahr-tray-uss.  As for Tethys, I think the pronunciation given in the Encyclopedia Mythica is probably the Old Greek versian.  There's a star in Bootes called Arcteus, or something really close to that.  I might have messed up one letter.

Ecco isn't my favorite game, but it's up there.  I almost tend to like Sonic better.  But I like Ecco just about as much.  I was drawn to Ecco simply because I love dolphins.  I have tons of favorite animals, but dolphins are near the top of my list.  Not first, but close.  I rented the game and thought it was really fun, even if I couldn't get past the Undercaves.  I rented it a couple more times before I finally bought it.  And I was so excited when I found out there was another one coming out.  I loved just jumping around.  I never actually beat either one.  I only got about half way thru both.  I only beat ToT with the level select code.  I didn't know the one for Ecco 1, and now that I have it I haven't had the chance to play it.  I never got past the level with the orcas right after Asterite's Cave, only because there must be some bug because the exit is blocked off and there's no way to get thru, nothing I can use.  I've searched the whole level thoroughly.  I guess I just kinda gave up in Ecco 1 and even when I started playing it again, I didn't play it very much and never got around to getting thru the one level, it was one of the ice levels.  I think I got to the Big Blue once, but then I never got any farther.Before ToT even came out, I made up several characters.  I came up with the members of Ecco's family, along with a dolphin named Bubbles, who was supposed to be his girlfriend, and her family.  And a few other non-related characters, too.I rented Ecco Jr, and that was really fun even tho it was a game for little kids.I've barely played DotF.  Even now that I have the level select code I only played it once recently just to try it out.  And I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do in the 3rd level.  I didn't play any of the other ones. I never did beat that big shark.

I never got past the level with the orcas right after Asterite's Cave, only because there must be some bug because the exit is blocked off and there's no way to get thru, nothing I can use.  I've searched the whole level thoroughly.Hang around the orcas and one of the calfs will swim away, follow it.Took awhile for me to figure that one out. (That's the night I stayed up too late and dreamt Captive's Vow)I must have rented Ecco1 once, and Ecco2 twice. Then the rental store went out of buisness and Blockbuster gave up on Sega in favor of N64.Ecco Jr. was the first ROM I mangaged to find that worked on my computer. Then Ecco2. I was absolutly crushed when I beat Ecco2 and knew I couldn't play Ecco1. About 50 sites later, I finally found a working Ecco1 ROM. Shortly after, this site, I bit too late to help me out though.I really liked the Ecco games. I guess it's the only game I can keep coming back to. I remember declaring a long time ago that dolphins were my favorite animal. Then I guess I forgot. Ecco kinda helped me remember. One bad thing kinda detach me from the world. Most recently I think it was one of the Atlantis levels.

You know what Phosis? I used to have a dolphin plushie named Ecco too! It was originally my brothers but I guess back when I was like 4 or 5 my mom made him give it to me. I still have it, in fact. It's like 14 or 15 years old, and its still in great shape. It's a little too big to fit in my scanner though. I have dolphin stuff scattered all over my basement, including the two Ecco games for Genesis (sucks I can't hear the music anymore on the games because of my old Sega).

How can you people actually KNOW these orcas personally?  How do you know their names unless you work there?Just how long do they live anyway?  And how long does it take for a baby to be born?Easy. Use powers of observation. All the orcas (and all the dolphins for that matter) all have names, histories, personal quirks, etc. After a while telling them apart becomes second nature.lifespan.. good question. About 35-50 years, females longer than males.Gestation is about 17-18 months.Takara's calf is unnamed at this point.

I think, I remember the movie called "Solaris" long time ago..... when I was very young, that is... but, all I remember of it (I think)is that, It was ??ANIMATED??.. and I remember seing the White-haired (green skin) woman riding kinda "Dragon type" creature (with wings). she has twin swords as her weapons. I also remember there was a battle between her and this evil humanoid (also: green skin) who had a sewer replacement for one hand. She killed him with his own sewer O-o, and there was blood all over. After that, she flew away.Has nothing to do with Lem's book. The word "Solaris" has many meanings; The one you will see the most on the 'net is a version of UNIX by Sun Microsystems. You could probably find the word in still different contexts with a little searching.. (for example, just connect it with the word "Greek" and you get a  cruise ship)

The males orcas live between 50 and 60 years, and the females can live until 90 years.They keep their baby in their stomach during 18 months.

thank you all once again for the kind compliments on that poor dolphin drawing of mine i had done a while back ^_^ it is odd how that dolphin and eao's are quite similar in name, since i had based scyfin's after the word "siphon", i just wanted to make it seem a little different... i have been asked, though, if his name was based after "sci-fi", but i try to refuse that, especially since eao's deserves that a little more than i in her dolphin's look. eaoD

Well, NeoEcco, you could...- reroute nerves so that the control of some irrelevant  area of your body is changed to control of those arms (human equivalent) )- let them control themselves. A good choice would be to install pretty damn advanced AIs in their controlling computers :). The 'fin could then just give them generic orders ("pick that rock up while I swim over it") and ignore the actual working of the hands- have somebody else (a human?) control them. Lag times would be a big problem, besides, it wouldn't be very reliable...

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Good, good, I have the keys I want now :).Just a hint for those who own a Compaq Armada laptop... Don't try emulating Ecco on it. At least in Windows it can handle only two keys being down at the same time. Since, for example, jumping over an island already takes three keys, I won't really have chances for playing the game during this weekend...Hmm...I wonder if using a real keyboard in the PS/2 port would help? Or maybe I should use DOS mode... * wanders off tinkering ways to run Ecco *

Yeah, the name's Marée stéllaire. I would actually recommend reading it in English, though - books tend to be more enjoyable in the language they're written in than in a language they're translated to. Or at least I believe they are. I haven't yet read any book both in Finnish and in English...

I have did a revamp of the reviews section and hope people will make some damned reviews!http://arkonviox.com/enigma.php?id=reviewsAnyhow thats the new improved reviews section powered by enigma. and just you wait as soon as every page on my sites converted to enigma html i will be able to release the "metamorphosis" feature which will allow my site to transform into what ever look you might want up.so tell me what you think.
</div>

<div id='container'>
which is something they should do with creatures like pandas and what ever else is gonig extinct.but the worse that could happen with a dolphin being insiminated is it rejects the baby and possibly kills it.

<div id='container'>
why don't you get a game pad and use that o.o

heh somethig like that could make my life easier, kinda makes you think though, one day we will all be linked to computers in a network and contorl these computers with owr minds. it will be like the matrix and a programmer will be more like a god. and playing video games will be alot like you know through the mind.heh i can vurtually kick anyones ass problem is like in the matrix i could get hurt. still it would be cool.

Hey miana it took me a while to find this post i been wondering what happened and kinda worried you left.yeah me and dolphin were just talking about you i'm glad your still around and havent left. it seems like alot of people have left these days and new people have taken there places. any how welcome back i guessi can let you in on whats up.I'm working on a new enigma...and have been kinda slow on work over the site.heh NOTHING has been happening? theres been alot happening. i guess i got to make soemthing happen eh?

Holy standards violation. PC specs say that all keyboard controlers have to support *atleast* three keys down at once. (for ctrl-alt-del)A PS/2 keyboard shouldn't matter since its the same controler onboard (i think), probably the winner solution is a cheapo gamepad if you have USB on that thing.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Arkon go watch Tron :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm... interestingly enough, ctrl+alt+del does work. Maybe I should try reconfiguring keys inside dgen? IIRC it helped with at least some computers... About ten years ago...And since I'll be using this laptop only on maybe every other weekend, I don't think I really care... This far I've lived without it, so I think I can take a few days of Ecco deprivation every now and then ;).

... linked? You mean we'd still have biological - decaying, short-lived, limited bodies that are only a result of what would be best for each little vermin of Earth that we have been on the way to transcendence?How primitive.Real progress is uploading your mind into a computer... And then imprinting yourself into the fundamental structure of the Universe as a demi-god  . But at the very least getting out of your biological body is a must. Even with direct mind/machine-interfaces, for a person to stay in his/her biological body for his/her whole life in the future would be like us always staying in the place we were born in even though we could be travelling to the stars...

Back to the arms: Startide Rising Brin had the dolphins were a harness, and they could control arms on the harness through a neural link.I guess with practice it would be as simple as moving a real arm.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah! surely the best of the ecco games is the music... its makes me feel very happy. but midis sucks! i wonder if theres a posibility of making mp3 or something...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
thank you kindly for all of the ideas there! i personally like the suggestions made by Ari Rahikkala and Artreus concerning a cyberlink or neural link control of the mechanical limbs, that seems most fitting for the character himself. those arms he has on are not permanent, he can remove them and the plate harness he has on under his chest when he has completed something, so it would make sense that he would only really need to control them when he has them on. very few star-gazer dolphins use that type of device anyway, only the highly scientific are permitted to use them in their experiments and studies. but it is nice to know people are actually interested in that old drawing of mine ^_^...... oh, and sorry about taking attention away from your post here, eao   ...

I said this elsewhere, I forget where at the moment.I can do it. No, not really, but I know a way I could do it. Step 1 Plug cord into microphone jack on back of comp. Step 2 Play sound file while recording with computer. (Note Unplug all. (Not the comp.) Step 5 -Sound recorder cuts out after about 30secs, creating a break in the sound. -It's been done before, but now the quality is very bad, possibly because of a bad cable/adapter. -I don't have a PS2 or Dreamcast to play the game fromI do have a Genesis that I've pulled sound from, but the other two problems still apply. Maybe I'll play around w/it and see if I can get anything more than static. :?

You can rip the actual FM Music from the rom as far as genesis goes, but you're not going to get better audio than FM is capable of.For dreamcast try ripping the redbook audio tracks from the CD itself, they should be visible on the outer edge of the second ISO track.I don't know how PS2 disks are composed.

Tethys, there is a way to exit the Asterite's Cave in Ecco 2. It's kind of hard to explain, but you have to swim above the Asterite and wait for the space between his two...freaky looking dna strand things to appear when they separate. (what are those anyways?) Then you just swim down inside that open space (but be careful to stay inside it) and exit through the bottom.  :D

Hmm.. my version is 1.22, and since I downloaded it from the official homepage, it should be the newest. The problem is that while the user interface of DGen in Windows (the one I use at weekends) is very intuitive and nicely menu-driven, while the interface of the same program in Linux (the one I usually use) required checking two man pages, README file and finally the source to just figure out how to save the memory state. However, now that I've read them, I should be able to customize everything I need to.

So I've decided that I'm going to make a comic about 4 close buddies just... well, hanging out!I'm calling it "Ctrl+Alt+Delete"! Why I called it that? I have no clue. Delphi said it, and I thought it sounded cool.It's going to be a series of short comics, based on my friends and stories, and your's if I can!

Hey! Those are some pretty cute orcas. Wish I had an aquarium in my backyard *laughs and sighs*. those pictures look great also! Better than any I've taken so far! I wonder what they'll name the calf?!Hope it's something nice and not a hard-to-pronounce name.

What got me into ecco was because my aunt was an art colelctor and she knew i just got a gmaegear but had no game so she got my ecco the dolphin because the artist who did the pict on the front was borris a famous artist.After playing that game i was drawn to ecco 2 which made me a fan for keeps.

if i could explain my story i have one type of cyberfins which is the alphadolphins and then theres evar reave a biological machine.i havent seen tron yet although i hear its interesting.thats funny you mention minds getting transferred to a machine. One day this interenet i belive will beome a virtual world, and will find information much like we did in the old days but finding it would be easier as going to some virtual library and getting it.We'd be able to fight each other too and see everything as if it were real and hackers would be gods cause they could hack into this new internet and make it so they can manpulate everything around to how they saw fit.the funyyier part is we'd all be hook up through owr minds. in a world that would be like soemthnig out of the matrix but not a world that controlled us but rather a world to go into for entertainment and stuff much like a holodeck on star treck but since were not that far it would be a dreamworld that would link to us with a machine that can communicate with owr brains.just a thought but when people say this is just the internet possiblities are it could become more then that. what we have no is just as bad if is just the internet why do we encounter so many people in owr lives who become owr friends, new loves and so forth. i don't belive in internet relations but there are people here who im close to. some people take the internet seriously others don't. the way i see it i take it both serious and not serious. i know i can play with the heads of those who take it serious and show the people who dont take it serious that it can be a serious place to descuss things and understand things better. the internet is the ultimate collection of information but in my opinion it still needs to be further developed.

The standard procedure for opening an image on Geocities is copypasting the URL to the address field of a new browser window...You can also use Proxomitron, which can be got (with luck) from http field from your outgoing HTTP headers. The biggest problem with installing Proxomitron tends to be getting to download it at a time when the site has neither been DoSed or taken down because of too high traffic, after that you should be able to figure out how to make it work...

Star Trek was Gene Roddenbury's ideal future. People (mostly) get along and they build cool gadgets. On the other hand, he made Andromeda (kinda hard, seeing as how he's been dead for a few years) Things aren't so happy in Andromeda and they have a harsher outlook on life. What they have there is a cyberlink (I forget what they call it) It's an implant on your neck that you can plug yourself into computers/AIs with. The thing is, inside the AI has complete power. Not unlike the matrix, but this view is apparently shared by many.One day the universe will end and there will be only three survivors: Me, the cockroaches, and Dylan trying to save the cockroaches from me.

One day this interenet i belive will beome a virtual world, and will find information much like we did in the old days but finding it would be easier as going to some virtual library and getting it.This is already reality, in a way.

(In fact, my theory of socialty states that in such a state no man would ever actually see another man since only dangerous thing left in that world would be the human mind (I can elaborate if you want)) But maybe you just were a viking in your last life and are now yearning for Valhalla :).

Hope it's something nice and not a hard-to-pronounce name. I've heard of lot's of dolphins with strange names that even the person who named it couldn't pronounce it!  Erm, Where was this?

I don't know if being active in mornings is blessing or a curse. In any case, there's usually a very clear limit "alertness limit" for me: If I'm even one bit more drowsy then where the limit is, sleeping is no problem for me. If, on the other hand, I'm even one bit less drowsy, it means no sleep for me until the next night. And the area between the limit and sleep is very thin for me; Only a few minutes of being up inevitably means going over.

I don't think confusing Shadow and me would really be that hard... I strive for it ;).Re: Why I use Linux... I've already explained this on the General Forum in the thread "The Obligatory Newbie Introduction Thread" (actually several times) but it's a pleasure to answer anyway. I'm a rather playful person in general, but there are few games that I actually like. I'm not playful like "I want to play games" - it's more like "I like playing around with ideas and frobnicating every knob I can find". That's why I prefer jumping through hoops and reading endless amounts of documentation to do anything with my computer... (now this was the reason why I still use Linux, the original reason why I migrated to Linux was the sheer crappiness of Windows)

I want to know if anyone can help me.Okay, I have two accounts on Tripod.  And recently I started using FrontPage for one of my sites. It works perfectly fine, no problems.But I also wanted to use FrontPage for my other site, too, and I have everything done.  But I can't publish it.  It works just fine with my first site as I said.  Sometimes it says it can't find tripod, or something like that.  But most of the time it will start to conect and then I will get "The server could not complete your request." Along with some other jargon.  I only had this problem once with my other website, but with this one it's every time.  I can either click on "okay" or "details" and when I click on "details" it says "Couldn't open /web/sites/us/frontpage/htdocs/error404.html"I guess that means I'm getting a 404 error all the time, but I have no idea what that is.  And it's very peculiar because, as I stressed several times, it's perfectly fine with my other website on my other account.  I tried Tripod's help page but it didn't tell me anything that helped.Does anybody have any clue what the problem might be and if there is anything I can do??

And the Vortex kinda sucks life out of the sea.Aw, heck, let's just ask him where all the names came from, except those that are obviouse, like Blackfin (even tho I still have no clue where he appears in the games).I suck.

i cant explain how to do html but i can say if you want to contribute a skin you can make it an imagine or anyhting if you know html thats fine and i can use my skills to add it to enigma.the best way to do html is to have a thing like dreamweaver or frontpage to help you build sites. with tools like those you just drag and drop things where you want them to go.

who are you analizing me for? when your on my site you should keep one rule in mind have fun and don't get involved in the politics.

<div id='container'>
well enigma is gonna have some built in things that make it simliar to php nuke but since enigma is in its begining developement there isnt relly much it can do right now.plus you have to have an equiped server to use it and it be nice to see other sites powered by enigma but, thats why alot of those site have enigma equivilants like php nuke and stuff.

they couldnt change the game anyways the guy incharge of ecco for genesis was ed annuziatta and he doesnt work for sega or appaloosa anymore. all i can say was the only reaosn why the sega cd was different from the genesis or stuff like that was cause ed wanted to add in the things he left out.and the guy i talked to who was working with sega on releasing the smash pack had nothing to do with the older ecco's most of those people have moved on to other things.rumor has it though ed annuziattas gonna get rights back to ecco but thats only my guess ;)well, where does he work now?

I'm not well versed in the art of finding information on the game or discussing about it, and the off-topic of this site is certainly not enough for the amount of fun my mind requires for working. This all means that I have to get involved in the politics a bit, too, since otherwise I would be just too damn bored around here to even post anything. What's so bad with a bit of politics in my life every now and then :) ?Besides, I have to say that even though you are the webmaster or this place, you aren't the best person to represent this community outside (all claims of that I claim the title of the best representative to myself are hereby rudely laughed and farted at). Many people have been able to keep a reasonably good relationship with you even when they have been posting to sites which are officially against you.

Yep, announcement.As of now, I'm officially closing The Abyss and it ain't gonna be opened up again.Anyone who had me linked (I know there were a few, at least), thanks a lot for your support, and I did appreciate it. But take the link down  8) Yeah, yeah, I know. I never updated the damn place and all that so it's not like it's a big letdown or anything. I don't know why I even bother with websites, because I don't have the want/dedication to keep one up and running for any length of time. I'll leave that to Arkon. I'm retiring from the website business   With that said, I'm gonna send Arkon the chapters of Chronicles of the Keeper that I had completed in case I ever feel like finishing bits of it. Ditto with the art from it, because I'd like to know that's around when I want it to be. If that's all right with Arkon, anyway. And I'm still keeping the music I had (thanks a lot for that song if you're still around, EccoChick! I still have it, and I still love it!)So! I've decided that I'll work on little things here and there for this place. I've got some comic ideas in mind (Ecco Kids! Joy) and I still want to finish that Atlantis story I started a bit back. But no website. Yeah.Well, that's about it. Just a little announcement, more for the people who had The Abyss linked than anyone else. Talk to yers later!

Ari i would like for you to stay on my site you seem cool enough, i'm sorry you got involved with the politics but the politics here coems in two flavors. one flavor is whats going on withen this site the other is -the cover up- people are aware of both but there here for this website and for ecco.lets you and i make a truces and forget about the caverns cause we aint there. and lets forget your psycological profile ever existed and forget we ever got into topic about this crap and continue on.I don't care what you do but i'm not sharing anything more about my personal fueds with you anymore. they are irrelevant to you, but for me they are issues that need to be dealt with one way or another.to be honest to solve this problem one key element plays a role -time- and all this is, is a race. who can last the longest?and who are you to judge weather or not im good at representing my site? everything people can relly say about me is this is childish that is childish. oh shut the fuck up.ari this descussion will never be brought up on my site again. and no one will see it alright? good.

Hey, that sounds cool, what Arkon said about us being ina  virtual world...It sounds a lot like that whole Cyberpunk thing, about people hooking their minds up to computers, and hacking the net, (and sometimes having their brains fried) I want to write a story about that now....

Tethys, there is a way to exit the Asterite's Cave in Ecco 2. It's kind of hard to explain, but you have to swim above the Asterite and wait for the space between his two...freaky looking dna strand things to appear when they separate. (what are those anyways?) Then you just swim down inside that open space (but be careful to stay inside it) and exit through the bottom.  :DNo, I wasn't talking about that.  I was talking about the part after that, in the second part of the level when you go back to the present and you have to find the baby orcas.I was at our cottage over the weekend, which is where I have my Genesis, and so I played that level to see if there was anything I missed, even tho I knew I already searched it thouroughly several times. Well, after not finding anything, I went back to talk to the orca mother to see if that would do anything, and of course she just said the same thing as before.  So I started swimming away when I noticed a baby orca was straying quite a distance from the others.  At first I thought it was a glitch, but then I noticed it seemed to be going towards the end and then I remembered someone said that a baby orca leads you to the end.  But how do they expect anyone to figure that out? Especially those like me who are less observant.And, when I said I didn't get past the level after you find the Big Blue, I was wrong.  I dunno why I was thinking that.  I think it was because I lost my instruction manual where I'd written all the passwords down and I had to start over to get the passwords again and I couldn't get as far as before. Actually the level I couldn't get past was one of the prehistoric levels.  The one where you run into the Asterite at the end and you have to steal one of his globes.  I never figured out how to do that.  I thought maybe you have to attack whichever one is flashing, but that didn't work.I guess I'm just a lot slower than everyone else here because I seem to be the only one who never beat any of the games, except for ToT which I only beat with the cheat code.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The little orca screams after it leaves the screen   Yeah, I know the're just its sonar return, but the're so high.I got through Ecco 2 with lots o' help from the ROM save feature, as said, very helpful in levels such as skyway and such.Ecco 1, I cheated. I turned on the invincible code and pummeled the Asterite. It didn't seem to take very long, but I couldn't do it w/out the code. That's the only time I cheated to beat an Ecco game. Ecco Jr.'s fun though. ? Can't think straight right now... mind keeps drifting... Good thing schools closing up, I probably wouldn't be able to keep track in another month. Wrote a new poem last night, and then I was sad, 'cause its true  roll: I did not come to this site to be a poet, but when life gives you lemons...

the honest truth is i don't know anything about tripod or front page. all i know is you upload things through a script. i graduated from that long time ago and use ftp's to upload my work so all i can say is it could be a script problem.

Actually I think I explained that, too, somewhere in my introductory thread but there's no chance in PRH anyone but a genius would remember it... My avatar picture simply used to be (on other forums) a rather generic dolphin with the background shaded to blood red. I just told everyone that he was grinning an insane grin in a pool of human blood and it was so popular that I got into an online 'zine (not a particularly known one, though) by saying that...

Where the heck is Shadow? He always has answers for everything.Well now it's not working for either site.  I did find something on Tripod.  Most of what it said didn't apply to me, I checked everything and I didn't have any of the problems it mentioned.  But it also said it could be a slow connection, and that certain ISP servers, including AOL and some others, usually have that problem.  Well, in that case, how in the hell am I ever supposed to publish it??!   Well, if it worked before, I guess I'll just have to keep trying and see if it will work again.I wonder if it would do any good if I used something other than Tripod that supports FrontPage.  I really don't want to have to stop using FrontPage if I can help it, it's better than Trellix.  But at least with Trellix I didn't have this problem.  Does anyone know of any other hosts that support FrontPage, that's better than Tripod?  Or at least one where I don't have to use HTML that doesn't suck? It has to be free.  Otherwise I'd use Homestead, which I used to use until they decided to start charging. Homestead was great.  If I wasn't so lazy and if I had more time I'd learn HTML...and if it were a lot simpler...If we ever get Charter, like we've been thinking about doing, then I wouldn't have to worry about anything being too slow.

The little orca screams after it leaves the screenI noticed the squeak, but I thought the baby orcas were squeaking as kind of a response to Ecco when you talk to the mother or something.  I didn't realize that it was just one squeaking to get you to follow it.I printed out the codes from this site but I forgot to bring the paper with me when we went to the cottage.  If I can remember to bring it next time, than I can use the cheat code for Ecco 1.Oh, and when I said I never beat any of them, I forgot about Ecco Jr.  But that doesn't count because it's impossible not to beat it.  I've only rented it a few times, but it's really fun despite being a children's game.  I just liked to play around in the explore mode.

<div id='container'>
If it's ported directly from the Genesis version does that mean it will still have 16bit graphics rather than 32? Well actually I might still get it because I have my Genesis at our cottage and then I could play it at home and without having to mess with the stupid old system to try to get it to actually work.  The only thing is the old passwords might not work for it, and the codes might not work either but I haven't used any codes for it mostly because I didn't know any.  And I lost all my passwords anyway and had to start over, so it's no big deal.  It would be nice to be able to play that game again without a fuzzy screen and having to keep jostling the machine before it will work and adjusting the cable connecter and still not being able to get a clear image no matter what.

Those sprites that float around in front of everything aren't just on the front page, they're everywhere.At first I thought that was the coolest thing, because I had never seen anything like that before.  I didn't know it was possible to do anything like that.But they do get in the way a lot, but I mostly just visit the forum anyway and the only other part of the site I ever look at is the fanfare, which is only worth visiting if there's something new on it.And the sprites we were originally talking about here that Doomtrain made, those are just for fun.  it has nothing to do with anything.I don't think sprites are a bad thing.  It doesn't say anything about the webmaster at all, not even a little bit.  Only if that's the only thing they ever use or if they use them constantly in everything, then it's cheap.  But I couldn't say they're easy to edit or anything considering I myself have absolutely no clue how to do it.

Nah, Arkon's just thinking about a discussion we had on IRC a while back where I had a long conversation about the aspects of CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions..Besides, I probably know more about the delivery of cased submunitions than Friecco does. Enough to know you don't drop them on houses. Use a Paveway or some other general purpose bomb for that. Have the armory set tail fuzzing only.As for sending stuff, I'd be up for sending birthday cards to whoever wants one. Anything else is kinda dependant on whatever financial state I'm in at the current moment.*pokes Sonar* I hope you know theres a reason to keep a shotgun in condition 3 up until the point where you're going to use it; the safety on a shotgun isn't great and might not pass being dropped or jostled in condition 1. Besides, if you were really paranoid you'd own a rifle :)

Client error 404 is "Resource could not be found" - The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable. (from RFC 2616, Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1)You have something misconfigured in frontpage that its attempting to upload its stuff to a location not permitted by Tripod. I doubt it has anything to do with slow connection. It could be misconfigured FP extensions on the tripod side, but i doubt that too. Doublecheck your site config on your site that doesn't work and retry.

The problem with that picture was that I had originally done it in pencil and tried to scan it. but...my scanner is a piece of shit, so it didn't scan too well. Only the really dark lines showed up, and all the shading didn't show. So I just went into paint and coloured it in with the mouse and stuff.

The bunnehs are the void, a hole in the fabric of the universe.Taking away some of them only results in the widening of the hole, which manifests to our perception as more bunnehs. Take care, for every time you take away a bunneh, you are risking your own existence...

Staying awake for long periods of time is not fun and doesn't make sense. Sleep is good. Normal diurnal rhytms are even better. They're an useful tool for making the world forget the differences between itself and you.

Staying awake a long time is fearable. Its fun because after about 30 hours you get stoned for free    And making sense, who said it did :)As for the whole diurnal thing, I've been primarly nocturnal for the last 3-4 years. Its very easy for me work all night and then go to sleep at 8 am, wake up around 4pm and repeat.

.... well, I'm not exactly so sure of the evilness... but it has got a "spirit" of its own. The problem is, even though I'm an old-timer there, having been posting almost ever since the initial creation of the forum, I haven't quite been able to grasp its actual nature. I can explain a little bit of it, but certainly not enough to warrant anyone's continued posting there - and while I could give an explanation of why the place was created, this explanation would already be enough mind-blowing to turn away all but the most curious souls... And further journeys into the complex reasons behind the spirit of the forum are impossible even for me. That's why I'm asking for your help...

Would that have to do with non-photo blue? Copy machines don't copy most shades of light blue, we used this to our advantage in Art Class.My scanner's worthless too, which is why I havn't sent in any pics.

Gdk-ERROR ** The original install of Debian on my comp was Potato rev3 (stable). When I got a 'net connection, I switched pretty immediately to Woody (testing) and had all packages upgraded. However, apparently my experiments with apt-spy (a program that makes FTP connections to Debian's mirrors and writes a sources.list according to the speeds of the connections) ended up in that I had the sources.list of Potato (apt-spy seems to write sources.lists for stable as the default) on Woody. Since I didn't know how often programs were upgraded in the testing distribution and didn't run apt-get update/upgrade often, I didn't notice anything being wrong. I might have done a reinstall of some part of X (can't remember anymore) with that configuration, which could have lead to those problems.After tinkering with a lot of different stuff (like the installing of XFree86 4.2.0 from their own binary distribution, bypassing apt) I finally noticed the problem - today. After fixing the sources.list I had some 266 packages to upgrade :D - thank Higher Powers for the existence of broadband... X also runs now just as it should, save some weird glitches like that backspace doesn't work under xterm (more properly, it does work when I'm running vi or the bash command line, but not when I'm writing to a file with cat). Now I'll just need to reconfigure dosemu to work and find a way to stop dgen from being uninstalled every time I use apt (I can only install it with  dpkg --force-depends because it wants libsdl version 1.1 and I have version 1.2, and apt always want to remove it due to unmet dependencies)... * happily runs off to continue configuring Linux *

Hmm, Perpetual Fluidity... If that was the one where you have to adjust the water levels to get outta those god damn tanks, then that was the hardest for me. Two days I spent on that level... Nearly killed me, non stop action, no food, no drink.I got so sick of it that I dived out of the water into an open tube above. I landed inside, rolled a bit, found I was stuck one way, so I decided to roll deeper inside.My health bar shockingly low, I was almost resigned to my fate. Nevertheless, I kept rolling on.Then the screen went black, and I saw the loading screen for the next level.Screwed up, but I'm not complaining!

Yeah...I have been gone an awfully long time eh?! I think it started the last 2 weeks of April...went back to Colorado to see my family...then caught up a bit when I came back...then...seemed to dissapear for what...almost a month now? I guess I just went through a phase of not wanting to be on the computer. That, combined with the fact that not many people here seemed to care one way or another about my existance here. This site sure has grown...lots and lots of new people...everyone contributing...tons of fan fics...I'm happy for your site's success Arkon... :D ...though, I have to admit me being not much of a reader at all...there for a while everything dealt with the fan fics, so my interest wasn't very high. Don't get me wrong...I think it's cool how many of you are writing them...and from what I've heard, they're good...so keep up the great work all you writers out there... ;)This past month though, while I've been gone I've spent lots of time watching the hockey playoffs...as you can see I'm a huge Av's fan...so that takes up at the very least 3 hours a night...3 times a week. I've been working on Cross Stitch (a form of needle work) a whole bunch lately...hoping it'll be good hand therapy (for those of you who don't know I injured them in a car accident a year ago). I'm going to start an ocean scene with dolphins, fish, and coral...so I'm excited about that. For now I'm working on one for a friend's birthday. I've also started getting out more...which has been real nice. I plan to go lots of places here in California when summer hits. I started by going to Yosemite for my birthday on the 19th of this month...turned 24...yipee...but it sure was cool seeing those waterfalls, and just plain being in the mountains. That was my second visit...and I plan to go a lot here soon...go hiking...all that outdoorsey stuff...heh!Anyway, that catches you all up to what I've been doing durring my long absence from this place. Sorry I've been gone so long...but hopefully I'll return on a regular basis. I've missed all my friends here...'specially you Arkon... ;) ...it's good to be back! Well, take care guys...maybe I'll see you around more!

That's a cool idea, and I like the look of the characters.  I like the style.  It looks kinda familiar, actually, but I dunno why.  Kinda reminds me of something you might see on MTV or something.I have a couple quick stories but I dunno if you could use them.At Prom they played Shout, and so a bunch of us were dancing around in a circle and raising our arms whenever they said "Shout!" (Cuz, you know, you're supposed to do that).  Well I didn't realize my best friend was bending over for some reason or another (probably to adjust her skirt or her stockings or something) and like I said I wasn't paying attention, and the song said "Shout!" and I raised my arms and smacked her in the face in the process.  I was like "Oh my god! Are you okay?!" But we were both laughing.And, this I think is funnier.  My dad was putting the dock out at our cottage (which is by a lake, of course, explaining why we have a dock), and my sister had convinced one of her guy friends to come up and help him.  My sister and my mom and I were inside, and all the sudden we heard this howl.  It was the funniest sound I ever heard, almost inhuman.  We looked out and all I saw was my sister's friend standing in the water with the waders on, and I thought he fell into a hole or something because that happened to another one of her friends once before.  It turned out that the water had rushed over the waders, and it was really cold because it was a cool spring and the water hadn't warmed up yet.It was really funny if you were there, you shoulda heard him howl.That's all I can think of.  I dunno how you could fit in those stories but maybe you'll be able to come up with something.  If not, just...don't use them..

Well like I said it was my opinion. I didn't want to offend you or make you mad or anything.  I shoulda added that everything else about them looks good, which it really does.  And those latest two that you posted look good, too.  Even tho the echidna's eyes are pretty creepy...but cool at the same time. I probably couldn't do something like that, after all.In truth, I can't even draw lips.  Maybe that has something to do with why I don't like them...they annoy me when I try to draw them.  At least you can draw lips...so..yeah...I'm just kinda babbling now.

I think it looks really good.  I've had no problems veiwing it. I like the pose.  I have no ideas on how to improve it, I could never even draw something that good.  Well, except that the lines should be smoothed out if possible.Um, I dunno if you originally intended to color it, or if you had it shaded in black and white and just decided to color it because the lines didn't come out...So I'll adress both, to the best of my ability.  Also I dunno what kind of scanner you have, but with mine it always likes to set black and white images as a b&amp;w photograph.  I just change the settings to color photograph, and it comes out a lot clearer.  And if it doesn't come out the way you want it the first time, you could try scanning it again.  I have had to do that before, and it usually comes out better the second time.If you were gonna color it anyway, what I always do is first go over the image with pen and erase all pencil lines, and then scan it as a b&amp;w drawing, and then it comes out as line art. Most of the lines come out and they're all dark. It makes it a lot easier to color, because then you can just use the fill tool.  But I always end up having to fix lines and smooth things out. But I could never do it any other way for the same reason I can't draw with a mouse.  I just can't be precise enough, it would just end up looking messy.

Thanks for the tip, Tethys! But, I have tried SO many times with my scanner and NOTHING works. I think I just need a new one.    Unfortunately for me, I am completely broke. But oh well. I think I'm pretty much just gonna work on it here and there...maybe touching some things up...adding new things...blah. I have a bunch of other pics I drew that I want to scan, but...THE DAMNED SCANNER IS NOT DOING IT'S JOB CORRECTLY!  Why is it not fulfilling it's purpose? *sob*  8O  Teehee.

BWAHAHAHA! I like Dawn's quote. hehe. Alright, here's a rather embarrassing excerpt from my life:Me and my best friend Megan were standing on the stairs, where we usually hang out, before school started. Being the weird people we are, Megan turned to me and pulled one of those super bouncy balls out of her purse. We started bouncing it back and forth, I don't know why. We were really bored. Soon we started bouncing it higher and higher and higher, and after Megan bounced it as hard as she could, it hit the bottom of the stairs and started bouncing like mad down the hallway! We chased after it, but by the time we had reached where it was, someone had picked it up and thrown it out of the hall and out onto the open campus.  We tried to find out where it went, and jogged around the quad until we saw a small crowd of people gathered on one end. We walked over to see what they were looking at (we were curious) and we saw Megan's crush sitting at a table with a thingie of clam chowder on his shirt. His friends and him were trying to sponge it out. Megan apologised again and again, and he turns to her and says; "Keep your balls off of me!" and shoves the bouncy ball in her hand. Needless to say, she never pursued a relationship.  8O

It's Thursday and I still haven't caught up to all the posts. o.o;  Of course, I was kinda busy and I missed a couple more days.  So I finally got back to this post.About the sleep thing, any time I don't have to go to school the next day, which includes weekends, vacations, and anything else, and if I don't have to get up early for any other reason, like when I had to take the ACT or when I had to get up to go to Orientation on a Saturday morning, then I always stay up till 2, sometimes later (but I get off the computer at 12 and pretend to go to bed because otherwise I could get yelled at..and then I just draw usually), and then I sleep until anywhere from 10-12, usually about 1130 or once I even slept till 2.  But now my mom wakes me up usually if I'm not up by 12.  The latest I ever stayed up was years ago, the only time I went to the yearly New Year's Eve party that they have at the Roll Arena that goes from 7pm to 7am.  I was falling asleep towards the end.And actually at the cottage I tend to sleep more during the day because they're isn't a lot to do.  But I like it because it's nice and relaxing and the lake is nice and the stars are a whole lot clearer.  And sometimes the theater, which is about 20 minutes or so away, has a good movie playing.  And there's an ice cream parlor that we go to in the summer. And there's the pontoon, the jetski (which I refuse to go on), the sailboat which we never use cuz nobody knows how to sail, and the paddle boat.

I stay at a cottage up in Maine, We'll be going there sometime this summer. We like it there because it's on a lake, so we can put in our kayak. We can canoe too, but why? A couple sea-planes land on the lake, which is kinda neat. Nothing to do in town though.You should try the Jetski some time. My last birthday (this Easter) we were down in Florida and someone gave me a ride in the gulf. The worst thing that can happen is you fall off, which is what happend to me )

Todo el mundo parecia somos locos.Having just finished my fifth year of Spanish, I can tell you that sentance is messed up.  You're saying "everyone (or literally "all the world") it seemed we're crazy."  Actually, without the accent, I don't think "parecia" is even a verb form, unless there's one I never learned.Depending on exactly what you're trying to say, I can think of several different ways to say it correctly.  But I won't go through them all unless you really want me to.I'm sorry, I just had to say something.  It's just how I am.  But you're other sentances were correct.  Except that you need an exlamation point at the beginning of sentances, too, it's not just question marks. And it's "viva."  "Vive" is subjunctive...or something..That's one thing I always get mixed up...and it's also the formal command form.Heh, imagine using that as a command.  "I command you to live!"And, btw,just for further reference, to make accents and upside-down question marks/exclamation points, just use the character map and it gives you the keystrokes for all of them.  It's under Start--&gt;Programs--&gt;Accesories--&gt;System Tools (or it might just be under Accessories).  For example, an upside-down question mark ¿ is alt+0191.Oh, and, hope you do well on your Spanish exam!

I don't send stuff to people I don't KNOW.  I don't know any of you guys beyond this forum.  And I don't know what anybody likes.  Who sends presents to a bunch of people they never actually met?  Hell, I don't even exchange presents or even cards with my best friend.  And how do you shop for someone when you have no clue what sorts of things they like?  how can you buy a card for someone when you're not sure what they'll think is funny, or if they'd prefer something serious?And there's the issue of cost that's been mentioned already.And then there's also the issue of privacy and giving out your address to a bunch of people when youmay never know their true identities especially since they could easily be lying about who they are and they might actually be a serial killer for all you know! er...Well not that I don't trust you guys (except maybe for some) but anybody could come in here and look at what your posting and if everyone's posting their address they'll see it and who knows what could happen!But mostly I just don't like sending stuff.

Our lake is a small one, and it's less than an hour from here.I'm not worried about getting wet.  I went on the jetski once with my sister.  She was going slower than normal and I didn't like it.  I don't like things that go really fast like that.  Unless it's a car or a plane or even a speedboat.  Jetskis and motorcycles and other such things scare me.  It doesn't matter how many times I'm told I won't fall off.  I'm not even really sure that's the whole problem, I a lot of it is just the speed and the bumpiness.  Once I was on a scooter and I was scared to death.  Of course that's even worse cuz if you fall off you land on the hard pavement.  With a jetski, you just land in water.  You might drown, if you're too stupid to wear a lifejacket (like some people on the lake), but at least then you lose all thought and feeling before you actually die so you don't feel any pain.No, I'm not scared of that.  I just don't like falling, and pain.  I guess it's mostly an irrational fear.  But not as much as my fear of heights or nearly as much as my fear of spiders.Oh no, now they all know my fears. o.o; Now they can get me! x.O;;

"All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less."

Hey, even the developer of mutt has confessed that he prefers fetchmail. Or at least I remember reading something to that effect several years ago.... Very vaguely...And for a vi vs. emacs thread...

Four weeks. It works like this; I take my exams, but not all simultaneously, day after day. Rather I take maybe one or two exams one day, then do one the next. There is the odd day when I'm  not at school at all.For about 15 exams (at least one for each subject-sometimes more than one. eg. french speaking, listening and reading). But you may still think that doesn't add up to four weeks.Well, it doesn't.This coming week, I'm fortunate enough to have my half term (one week holiday, which, as a coincidence, coincides with the Queens Golden Jubilee ie. she has been 'ruling' for fifty years).So I'm free for ths week, then back to my last rotten exams.Once they are over, I can enjoy freedom.Right until college...

I learned more grammer from Spanish than I ever did in English.Vivir is an ir verb, therefore conjugated in the present tense aso      imoses    (I forget)e      enSo, I believe 'vive' (He lives) is correct. Though (in meaning, not directly) it means 'long live Arkonviox' 8) I thought that first line was messed up, I pulled it from a book describing Pamplona's running of the bulls.

An "emulator" is really not much more than a simulation of a CPU and related chipsets. Anyone thats done work on a simulation of a complex device that is less than fully documented (and even if it was, it still wouldn't be trivial) knows this is more of a guessing game than pure science.I've got extreme respect for people like the developers of Zsnes or Dgen, these are not simple or half-assed programs, unlike the common PC application these days.

The tube = wormhole-like passage to the Machine back on Planet vortex.  This was not the original intention of the machine, it was modified to do this as a last resort for food as the vortex were starving after the War with their sister planet.  The Machine ("The Pinnacle of Light" being its true name) was originally designed to be a weapon of mass destruction to destroy the sister planet.  While it was firing, a stray missile from a nearby battle hit the control tower and knocked it into the machine, causing it to lose control and gain power until it ripped itself apart in its doing.  This destroyed the city and planet quite badly, and the vortex were forced to rebuild the machine and modify it to reel in life forms from planets in its path.  This is What the Machine is and the tube is.   (oops, gave away a bit of the vortex history there   )

Haven't you guys ever heard of saunas   ?  Oolong's a fun rabbit, indeed, although I never understood the humour part in it... I mean, there are so many of those pictures that it isn't something funny anymore, it's just something... very... Japanese. Yeah, Japanese. I guess the reason we find it funny is just that we don't quite understand it... http://www.syberpunk.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?page=oolong

<div id='container'>
* reads Oolong's owner's message *Well... allright, the Japanese think it's cute and funny, too. Oh well.About the Choco Krispies... it's just the context they're put in that makes the picture weird. Not that it would not be the point, of course. For all that I know, choco krispies must be tasty while the picture itself definitely has a bit less taste :).

I laughed at my fear of heights. We hike a lot, and it's boring. So, we went up a cliff somewhere and I walked right up to the edge and looked at the several hundred foot drop to prove I could. Scared the hell outta my mother. So I don't care how high I am as long as it's stable. Then there are ladders. We painted out house last summer, and we have a two story house w/an attic. Needless to say, that fear had to go. There is one thing left: The Big Wheel at Six Flags Darien Lake. Go all the way to the top and let the cart sway back and forth, back and forth... I may have killed that fear too. I had it the other way, though. I was afraid I'll fall, so proving to myself that I'm the one that needs to make it happen is probably what killed it.

Ignore arkon. as shadow says...navel brain.i like the drawing and the emotions that are converyed, and i feel for you when it comes to scanner BS. what kind of scanner do you have anyhow?my beef w. the pic is the anatomy. the outline is good, but it needs more solidity...where ae the muscle lines? The lower leg is very slender, however, thats a style preference. i also agree about the compostition...neg space is okay to have in abundence but it must be wll spaced. the chic should be moved more to the lower corner, i think.okay im done. i still like it.

Astra 1220? I've got that model scanner. I don't see why you have problems with it, its a pretty high quality unit, as are most of the UMAX products. Check your Vistascan settings out and maybe turn off auto adjustment. I might be able to send you some settings for vistascan, though I dunno how well they'd work, I've reciently updated my main desktop scaner to an Astra 6450. Slide scanning is sexy :D

Azure Horizon, my 'inner sanctum'From my forbidden fanfics (ie. those unable to be posted on this site)Litterally, it is a coastal city built on the ruins of the town of Hayson, birthplace of Artreus.

I may have already mentioned this, but every summer I go with my family each weekend to our cottage, from Saturday to Monday, and sometimes we leave Friday.  Sometimes we don't go up, but it's almost every week during the summer.  So I just wanted to let everyone know I won't be around during the weekends from now on up till the end of August when I start college.And we'll be in Alaska for almost two weeks in July, including the week of the 4th.

Pause when you're facing the screen in a turn.(its been stuffed into my longterm memory.)Oy...I SAID I printed it out, but I just forgot to bring the paper that I printed it out on with me to the cottage, where I have my Genesis.  But I did bring it when we went yesterday.

Also don't forget to select "load game".  I forgot about that when I tried it the first time...I hadn't played DotF in so long that I forgot you could select all the levels you played previously.You also get all the songs and powers when you do that code, so if you're starting a new game then you have them from the start.Now the only thing we need is a code for invincibility.  In the other games that came along with the level select.  Maybe there's another code out there that will do about the same thing as the level select codes in the original two games, where you select a level number, x and y coordinates, and all that other stuff, along with unlimited life.  Who knows.

I didn't understand any of that....I don't like downloading stuff that takes half a day to download.  And I don't want to download anything that's gonna take up a ton of room on my computer because this computer is crap.  I almost never play games on the computer, and I can't play them anytime I want because other people want to use the computer.  The last time I downloaded an emulator and some ROMs they all disappeared somehow so somebody must have deleted them and I suspect my mom did it because they took up too much room.  Anytime something big like that is downloaded onto this computer, it screws up everything else because, like I said, this computer is crap.All reasons for me not to get an emulator.Plus, I don't know what happened to the game controller we used to have for the computer, and I probably could never get used to playing Ecco with a keyboard, if it would even work.  I don't like playing games by punching keys on a keyboard anyway. Unless it's like the old King's Quest games where you type commands and move around by clicking the mouse.And anyways, being an Ecco fan, I wouldn't mind getting it anyway just because it's Ecco.  And it would be portable so I could bring it anywhere and play it anytime I want.

That sounds really cool, BigBlu5!Hm, I never thought of the Vortex speaking.  For some reason they kinda remind me of really ugly bugs.  And the fact that they have a queen that's a lot bigger than the rest of them is very much like bees and ants.  I also never thought of them as having much intelligence, at least not like dolphins and humans.  Actually I never thought about it much at all.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was at the cottage this weekend again, and like I said that's where I have my Genesis. So I played Ecco 1, and I noticed some things...well, I already noticed them long ago, and I didn't forget about them, I just never thought about it and therefore never mentioned them here.  Just a few things I wanted to talk about, and I'm sure most of you have also noticed these.In Home Bay, by the left wall, there's a group of three fish.  The fish change every time you leave that area and come back.  And most of the time they're all different kinds, or two of them might be the same.  I just thought that was weird.Also in Home Bay, on the right wall under the rocks that block the exit, there's a shell embedded in the wall.  In the sonar map it's shown as a rock.  But it has no purpose.  If I remember correctly, I think it's still there even after the storm.  I thought that was kinda weird, but not as much as the fish.And then in the City of Forever there's a glyph by the area where you have to jump over the columns that doesn't seem to do anything.  I wondered if it opened up the area with the tide so you could get into the first pool easier, but I never checked it before hitting the glyph with sonar so I dunno.  I was wondering if anyone knows what it does.And then, I finally got the chance to use the level select code.  Well the first thing I noticed is that the levels are all out of order, except for a few of them.  That's no big deal.But then some numbers go to areas you could never normally get to, except with a password. That's what I really wanted to talk about.0 goes to the title screen, but then it gets stuck.Also, if you do the code while in the Home Bay or in the first level, it doesn't do anything.9 goes to the beginning part before you start where you choose to start the game or enter a password, and the health and air meters are there and it can be paused.  But if you exit either way it goes to the title screen and gets stuck.  Oh, and the password is SGJEJNCJ.10 goes to the opening animation, but it's playable with the health and air meters. And at the end you can't go anywhere.  I kind of remember doing this once before when I was just putting in random letters to try to find an actual password.  The password is SQEIMYMQ.11 goes to Home Bay, and I never actually beat the game, but it must be the end part because the music is different and all the dolphins say stuff about Ecco being a hero and everything.  But you can go thru the rocks and if you go too far to the right, before you even get to the other end of the bay, it gets stuck.  The password for this is IPXLMYMB.  It might work correctly if you use the password, but I didn't try it.I didn't get a chance to try all the numbers so I dunno if there's anything else like that.

This place is always really crazy. I notice nothing can stay on topic. Heh heh.There is no forum where threads would even tend to stay on topic. There are, however, some forums where going off-topic is not only a common effect, but an inevitable rule. Such as the Istvanistani Off-topic... http//www.arkonviox.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=336 ). In the Istvanistani Off-Topic there is no such thing as a "thread topic" because there is usually no link between messages that are more than two posts apart...

from this on"And then in the City of Forever there's a glyph by the area where you have to jump over the columns that doesn't seem to do anything. I wondered if it opened up the area with the tide so you could get into the first pool easier, but I never checked it before hitting the glyph with sonar so I dunno. I was wondering if anyone knows what it does. "is for the japanese version.  That glyph make that current accessable,and when you do the cheat code in the J version you get to CoF 1 (brings for into the past) and CoF 2 (before the storm).it won't freeze in any area....because there is a second open oceanbut you get virtually no freezing screens.

i thought it turned out pretty good, sorry it took so long to get it up. the reason the art contest isnt relly up is cause im reogranizing how fanfare is gonna be setup. Right now i'm trying to decide how to organize the fan ficts and poetry. as you can see with artwork i don't have them by name but rather there organized by name of the artist and entrie number. if anyones got anyhting against that let me know. i'm trying to figure out a better way to set this up and not use so many folders. i've almost reached a certain limit on my server but im not there yet.

I'm not going to Alaska until July.  I just thought I'd mention it while I was talking about how I'll be gone on the weekends.why Alaska!  it costs 7 bucks for a gallon of milk in some parts!Its cold and polar bears may get peckish!owiks.....Why Alaska?? Well, why not?  It may be cold, but a winter there isn't much worse than a winter in Michigan, and in the summer it's not really any worse than fall here.  We're going for the scenery and the wildlife.  And I just happen to love remote places, it's nice and peaceful.  We've signed up for a tour so we can be sure to see everything we want to see, and even tho we might see polar bears (I hope we will) it's not like we'd get close to them at all.  We might even see some whales and orcas.  The only problems are the time change (about four hours I think--going from one end of the continent to the other, and Alaska has its own time zone) and the fact that the sun stays out for half the night, which is why we want to make sure we have a room with curtains.

Well, my other web was there but not the one I was having trouble with.

Don't worry about the time difference, it's coming back when its a problem. Couple years ago went from New York to Arizona. We went by car (van, actually) so that helps. Hot in Arizona. Doesn't get so hot in NY. And if anyone says 'but its only a dry heat' I shall unleash the rath of Smorf upon you!  *gasp*I think there is a 1 hour difference between Arizona and Alaska, but it may be 2.*Looks it up*Naw, only one.

Oh, well, one of my friends suggested creating a new account, so I did, and it works just fine.And I finally figured out what the exact problem was, too.  There were files missing on my Tripod account.  I disabled FrontPage, and then re-enabled it, because in the help section it said that's what you should do if you deleted one of those files.  Well the ones that were missing were never there in the first place.  And when I re-enabled FrontPage, they still weren't there.  So there was nothing I could do.But now that I created a new account, it works just fine.  So what if the last part if the url is different now.

<div id='container'>
Still no cigar. &gt;_&lt; I did exactly that - I selected "New Game," put in GYU. It went to "END" but I put GYU in again, then I put in XXX. Created the game, looked in level select, still nothing. So I'm gonna try one more thing, and that is to remove the VMU that has the other saved game on it. Maybe they're conflicting with each other. I'll edit the post once I do that.EDIT - Nope. Nada. Nothing. Ziltch. &gt;_&lt;

when you put in that code your not suppose to make a new game.you enter the code extatly how it saysTo do the level select code create a new game and enter in GYU. Instead of hitting the 'end' button enter in GYU one more time then enter XXX (note: XXX can be any letter). Once you finished this hit the yellow button on your dreamcast controller - the 'x' button. Select a game or use your current one and all the levels will be open.after you enter gyu gyu xxx then hit the yellow x button then select a game.

CAUTIONevil)  Don't laugh,but I found four ways of mystery to be hard! first,I couldn't find the stingray in the red cave. I thought that you were supposed to lead the dolphin's ray through the tunnle,and it took me forever to figure out that I was dealing with the wrong stupid manta ray! Then when I finally found the right one,it took an eternity to get past the moray.(told ya it'll go on forever)  And then,I got totally stuck on the part where you have to pass the current,because I didn't knoe i was even pushing the rock down the hole until one day,when I finally saw it! Then the jelly fish kept killin me in the blue cave and when I accually finished the level,I realized it took me like,a month to get through!!!!!!!  Geez,I got a little touchy there! *takes deep breaths,in through her nose and out through her mouth* Okay. Okay. I'm cool. 8)

Well, I would tell you I'm a newbie, but with my post count, I don't think I can anymore (and Arkon told me to stop) This is the first site I visit regularly, and the only one I interact with.

Heh, I remember I very bad apptitude test I took a few years ago. it only had three answers for each question. We didn't figure out until after the test that choosing the middle answer would give you at least 50% apttitude for any job in the database.The report cards at my school spelled apptitude wrong on our report card comments. It's funny, beacuse in all the years they use the comments, they havn't noticed it yet.

Two weeks isn't so bad, as long as you have something to do. (and remember to do it) I think Arizona was a three weeker, Florida was two, and Kentucky was two.

To set up a sig, just click 'profile' up top, you can find the part that says signature and type in, then click submit at the bottom. It will be updated automatically and you don't need to worry about anything else, including re-registering. This (down below) is my forth sig in under 2 months.

Hahaha *laughs at Atrues's quote* Cool,you've been to FLA? I want to go to the Sea World their! The longest I've been away,was when we traveled to Alaska for a month to visit some old friends!

For an avatar, just find a pic somewhere and shrink it (or have someone do it for you) You can scan one too, if you are able. My avatar came from a poster above my bed, and I was trown into a trance when I saw the poster on the back of a reference book in my school's library. To find a pic, just type in 'dolphin' or something in a search engine, you're bound to find 'em somewhere. www.cetacea.org is a great place to look, but you may want to give them credit. You can also have someone draw on for you.To submit your avatar, start the same way as sig, but go all the way to the bottom. click 'upload from machine' (or something similar) and find it on your computer. After you're done, wait a few minutes for it to be uploaded. If it doesn't come up, you didn't wait long enough, If you have problems, you can always email it to Arkon, and have him deal with it.

Didn't go to Sea World in FLA. (too bad 'cause I wanna se an Orca!

I'll send it to fanfare one of these days.That was me who said that, it was on video and I masked my voice a bit.My brother was doing a reporter skit, and the guy jumped over a small chair. His shorts were covered by his suit, and my brother wanted me to say something to that effect. What my brother and I have said on film for various english projects can fill a forum of its own.

Clear!*-ZORT!-*  *hurls topic to the top of the forum*Ok, I've heard this at least twice now, but the last time I heard it it was from someone from Sea Grant New York who actually knew the guy this happened toThis one dolphin trainer trained his dolphin to collect the trash that blew into its pool over night, every morning he would go to the dolphin, give the signal, and she would go around collecting trash. For each piece of trash she brought up, she would get a fish (simple enough.) One day, the guy comes in, and the dolphin is very excited. He gives the signal, and she dives down on her treasure hunt. When she comes back, she has a piece of brown paper in her mouth. A small one, but hey another small piece of brown paper. Becoming suspicious, the trainer puts on a dive suit and finds out he's been conned.A brown paper bag blew into the pool overnight, and the dolphin realized its great potential. She pulled it underwater and stuck it into a pipe. Whenever she dove down, she would tear of a small piece to conserve the bag, and win more fish.As brought up by Sea Grant, how many young children would have figured this out, if you told them you'd give them a dime for each peice of trash they picked up?

I found this in my older forum but this explains who Arkonviox is:St. Gabriel was an arkangel of god, a messanger. And the highest of the angels as a human man. As a messanger of god, he would tell the earth of god and his wishes. He defied god by lieng and forging the messages of him into Gabriels own wishes. God punished him by banishing him into the sea and turning him into a dolphin. The dolphins face was scorhed of his human face, meaning that his dolphin face features were similar to his human. The dolphin attempted to fight god, but lost as half his face was ripped from his head and a golden mask which pleagued his face like a flesh eating poisong covered in its place.The dolphin, once a human, wore cloths like a man. wearing a dark purple cloak, resembling a human without arms, but moved through the water like a spirit. The dolphin gabriel vowed the destruction of god. For many centuries, the dolphin was able to stay alive, driven by anger and his never ending fight to destroy god. He was known as an earth god, but evil. Although gabirel could never win, he continued until god finally put him to his end by burdening his soul into his own hatred and banishing it into the earth. until the time of atlantis, a dolphinade of the old world was born into the very same hatred the dolphins name was Akren. unlike his fellow blood, the dolphin was a tan with red eyes, and his fin was miss shaped backwards, and his tail fin ressembled the bone structure of bird wings, and the burdened face of him from the scars made my his mask. Akrens originial desires were to dominate atlantis, until he was layed into dorment by Atla Akren would be recreated... with a mask like gabriels which poisoned his face This recreation was called "The project Arkonviox" and gabriel was reborn for the 3rd time. And that as they say is that. Thats is who gariel is. That is who Akren is, and that is who Arkonviox was. Arkons armor he wears is called "Wings" The Wings are an armor created by atla. Basicly, the stronger the wearer gets, the more the armor starts to take shape when it does. Arkonviox too, also changed. But on a normal dolphin, it doesnt. Arkons form changes when he gets stronger, so does his armor. A normal dolphin will get stronger but the dolphin will remain. The armor will still grow.3 types of Wings wre createdthe wings of burden, the wings of intervention, and the wings of timeThe 3 horned beasts.Intervention, Sitna's internal armor.4 awakening demons.Burden, Arkonviox's armor.and the wings of time. The ultimate power.

That's pretty freakish.  But it's also very well drawn.  And the cat -is- anthro, any animal with human-like features like that is considered anthro which is the same as furry.

I finally got around to drawing the last of my Ocean Gaurdian characters.  His name is Tangaroa, which I got from a Polynesian sea god (I think it was Polynesian).  His appearance is pretty much a cross between a shark and a whale.  And I swear I did NOT get that from LeviathonShark. I actually had that idea in my head for quite some time, but I was trying to think of something better. Obviously I couldn't come up with anything else, but I think it looks pretty cool anyway.http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/DisplayImg.pl?INO=150130All that's left now is Llyr, the original Gaurdian and parent to Tethys, Salacia, Alignak, and Tangaroa.  That is if I can figure out how he looked.  But it's not that important because he/she (I'm thinking it will probably be genderless) no longer exists, having "split", so-to-speak, into the current four Gaurdians.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, I forgot to mention.  I couldn't fit in all of Tangaroa's tail.  The tailfins are actually about twice that length.  I was originally going to make the tailfins more like a shark's, but wasn't sure how to do it with the position of his tail.

Hrm.I guess it depends on what they were using dolphins for, but most dolphins are not trained for general object retrevial (infact, the oposite exists, they're purposfully desensitized to foreign object in the enclosure, to prevent the mouthing of and potential swallowing of objects, which can prove fatal, I can think of two dolphins that I knew that died reciently as a result of complications from foreign object ingestion.)This is not to say that its not posible to do so. The RPP dolphins retrive stuff all the time, and can do so rather specifically. I wouldn't think the use of a primary reinforcment (food) would be a good idea here, as it develops an weak association with eatting the object.

Dolphin fact ? Hum...Dolphins can stay without breathing in really deep waters thanks to the "myoglobine". This substance serves for storing oxygene in the organs. When dolphins go in deep waters for a long time, they store a lot of oxygene in their organs, irrigent in blood only the heart and the brain.

do gay dolphins do the sodamy thing or just a lot of touching.do lesiban dolphins 'lick the carpet" eh? YUCK !!!! How can you say those things, Eao ?!?! Shame on you !   Animals can't be gay or lesbian ! The only homosexual dolphins are captive individuals, who suffer of psychological problems !

How does a dolphin masturbate? x.O;; On the other hand...maybe that's best left unanswered...They can caress or rub each other. Their skin is very sensitive, so they love to be touched by the other members of the group. Sometimes, they caress the members of the same gender, but it isn't homosexuality: it's a way to affirm the hierarchy.And males will kidnap females so that no other males can mate with her.  I saw all of this on some show that was about the "darker side" of dolphins.  They can be just as cruel as humans.Then, it's dipends...Most of the males who kidnap and violate the females are coalitions of males who live without any females, and take advantage of the passage of some alone females or females with a group for mating. They're the same who try to violate the young adolescent females. The males who live in a family don't have this comportement.

They can caress or rub each other. Their skin is very sensitive, so they love to be touched by the other members of the group. Sometimes, they caress the members of the same gender, but it isn't homosexuality: it's a way to affirm the hierarchy.Finning and other forms of direct homosexuality are common observances among cetaceans even as large as california grey whales. Its probably even more common in bottlenose dolphins due to their social structure.Then, it's dipends...Most of the males who kidnap and violate the females are coalitions of males who live without any females, and take advantage of the passage of some alone females or females with a group for mating. They're the same who try to violate the young adolescent females. The males who live in a family don't have this comportement.Bottlenose dolphins are a fluid social group, and outside of mating periods generally form three groups; Maternity with females with calves 0-2 years old, Juviniles consisting of mixed gender group 3-8, bulls which are mature males in groups of 2-10 in number. These are usually quite distinct and don't interact.These are not orcas; there's no real consistant famililal structure outside of mother-calf ties.

My mother keeps pestering me about that. "Do you think you can do this for a living?""Why are you just giving it away?"She's asking me to talk to my lawyer friend about it :? I've got plenty to write about, maybe I'll get something published someday too. Only time will tell...

If you follow your nose, you can do anything. Terry pratchett had two books published at age 16....and look at where he is today (author of Good Omens, and the Discworld series, which is EXTREMELY popular)

That's right...I do remember that... ;) ...back in the Undercave days. Come to think of it, that was only the second forum I had posted on...let's see...that was way back in...October of 2000...?! Yea...I think that's right. Anyway, so I've been around this community pretty much ever since. It's a great place to be... ;) ...welcome to the forum Lizza! From the looks of things...you've already had plenty of practice at posting...heh...almost more than any other newbie I've seen?! Seeya around... :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, have fun on your trip Lizza (when it gets here that is...heh)! Nah...2 weeks can be a breeze sometimes...and others...it can turn into what seems like ages! It all depends on what you're doing. So, my advice would be to keep busy... ;)

Shadow might have the experience, but I have on my side the support of Istvanistan  . I've shown my worth by already becoming a deity of the B0O0//ists and I don't expect problems finding a base of supporters here, either. Fortunately I didn't claim that Sid Meier would be the one true god :).Shadow, although that Gadsen flag might have appeared appropriate for the situation, I think the rattlesnake is really better suited for staying as a symbol of the American colonies than being in your use...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
As always Arkon...great story telling! But, like any of us who've been around for a while will sometimes hear these stories often times more than once. But that's cool...cus I find there's always something ya miss...or something that becomes more noticible the second time through... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah i told this story before but there was alot of people who didn't hear it and hey look even ari has taken it upon himself to fix it for me so...whats my point here? 8O

Most of the time when I try to go the only people in there are like...Arkon. o_o and sometimes another person, but they don't really talk. Heh. &gt;.&gt;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe.  Which I somehow always manage to pull off.  8O  Well, maybe I don't learn EVERYTHING. And sometimes...I forget I learned it until I see it on the final. And then I'm like," Hey...I know how to do this! SCORE!!" o____oI've been known to talk to myself during tests.  But not like, insanely. More like, whispering the problem and then whispering what I'm thinking in my head as I write it down. But still, people look at me funny. *shuts up now, realising she's going off into a tangent*  :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

<div id='container'>
We're disturbed.  :D

<br />

<div id='container'>
I like cheese. Do you not like cheese? WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHEESE?! 8O I'm sorry. Sometimes I...lash out. *looks away, ashamed*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Probably has something to do with that I told that I'm homosexual on the stats post thread... though I did that just for kicks...

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hahahah...Artreus...I totally share the same thought about those damned people who say "well at least it's a dry heat"...as if it compensates for the frickin heat...heheh! I moved here to California one year ago...and that's all we'd hear people say when we'd complain of the long periods of triple digit weather! Like, right now the high for tomorrow is expected to be 104...and yet there will inevitibly be someone who says that dag-blasted saying..."at least it's a dry heat"...hahaha! Sorry, just had to share the feeling of understanding with Artreus... ;)Anyway, that sounds like a lot of fun Tethys...I hope when the time rolls around to you going to Alaska, that you have a great time! And...have fun over the weekends... :D ...seeya!

seems like everyone hates americans because of how arrogant we are.I get sick of hearing that crap to...i just call it jelousy. There are so many people i'd like to beat the living shit of just for saying that. why can't people keep ther emother fucking mouths shut  8OI don't hate the Americans. I pity them. And I find it rather hard to believe that I would pity a people because of jealousity... But note that I don't mean all of them. I mean those Americans (more properly inhabitants of the USA)  who barely even know about the world outside the US. Those are really arrogant people, and nothing better can really expected from them. The US, being pretty much a superpower, can afford that some of its citizens ignore the rest of the world - of course China and Russia can do the same (but I won't go into that). Us Europeans, who tend to live in much smaller countries, don't like that attitude, since remembering the existence of other countries is vital for us. As far as I know, Americans who travel abroad are quite nice people and usually know how to behave... The same applies for most Americans on the 'net: if they've been able to journey beyond the maddening masses of AOL users they usually know and care much enough to follow the rules of international etiquette. Usually.Hmm...* Ari wonders what the PRH he was rambling on about again *

This was good If you want it to be funny, you laugh. If you want it to be stupid, you don't.If creating your own country makes you insane, then I should get padding in my room, for not only have I created a country, but a race to populate it (Orcarael, see SoR) their own planet, government, psuedo-religion, history, colonies, enemies, wars, heros, villans, mythology, goals, science, geography, emblem, anatomy, politics, common beliefs, aspirations, law, and language. Language was hardest (Do they say 'blue ball,' or 'ball blue') I also tried to create their own time, and, but for the time being, I give up. (Ok, around their star once is a year.

I'm surprised by how much I apparently knew, or came close to. I toss in some stuff into the fan fic, sometimes without noticing (transient v resident Orcas,) I have 'phins rub against each other (mearly as a sign of affection) and maybe some other stuff. Of course, some was done intentionally, (the lone bull Sperm whale, the antarctic orcas) in fact, the blue whale in the begining was taken almost directly from the pages of a National Geographic. NG is my primary cetacean knowledge base, and those that talk about whales/'phins live next to my bed. I keep the one with Sylvia Earle and Sandy as a cover on top.

I'm sure most of us have been to www.anipike.com, am I right? Well for a while now I've been wanting to start something a little different... the ultimate art site directory!!! A site full of links to other peoples (submitted) personal art sites, tutorials, comics and so on! And my goal would be to make it the largest art site directory on the web!!! "Your #1 Guide to the Onine Art Internet World!" as they say. Full of millions of links!!!Now understand, that this would (if it got off it's feet good) most likely end up taking a lot of time. Of course staff would be an option (my only option if things were to go well). Also, where would I host it? Well I have my little corner at Shadows domain, and it's not like a tone of text-only pages would be much a problem. So yup...Anyways! Tell me what we all think alright!!! Vote in the poll... now!

(Wow! Great idea, Artreus! You are a true visionary. ^_- Bah, anyways, this sounds like it should be fun! Lemme give it a go!)Armagron gazes across the sunlit waves as Noriko walks up. Only feet behind him, she drops to the ground, the impact of her body making a soft 'puff' sound on the sand. She tosses herself on her back and stares up at the sky, making noises like a train. "choo...choo...choo...choo...choo...choo...chooooo...WOO WOOO...choo....choo..." One of her eyes twitches as she continues her train sounds.

Awww...you could write me in there somewhere! (just kidding)  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
She couldn't getpast the thought that her......boyfried,Armagron was going one his journey riding a train. Noriko was afraid of trains. Just then,Lizza's unknown mysterious human form(?) walk's up wondering how she can help. She hand a bag of goods to Armagron. but only moments after,she too,drops to the ground in a *puff* repeatedly chanting,"choo....choo...chuga chuga chooooooooooooo....chooo!" Aperiantly (spelling?) Armagron had a wierd force-field that whoever comes close,gets put under the spell of the,"hit the ground,train around" curse.               (I have absolutely no clue what I'm talking 'bout)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Noriko continues her train noises. As her eye twitches, she slowly turns her head to look at Lizza. Suddenly she stops.        "Hi Lizza! How are you faring on this wonderful day? SPOOT!"As she said "spoot" her eye twitched more violently, as if she couldn't control her outburst.    "Narf!"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*snickers*  Oh yeah? Noriko,I'd like to introduce you to Rien! (pronounced,Ryan)    Rien,this is Noriko and she is a good friend of Joe!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh nooo! gets the idea that the smorf has casted the evil curse. "Why yes," says Lizza "It is a wonderful da...da.....da...." As Lizza tries to makle out the word day, she is suddenly smacked upon by a dreadful,,,,,,,darkness that now is telling her to take Joe hostage! It was the........Smorf.....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*cuddles with Effen*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Noriko somehow senses Lizza's evil plot. her head snaps up from the sand and her body bolts upright. "JOOOOOOOOOE!!!" She screams in terror. She grabs Joe and sprints towards the ocean with him, Armagron watching with a puzzled expression on his face.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*remembers her Orca stuffed animal in her room and runs to get it* Awww....it's like a slumber partie!

<br />

<div id='container'>
Loitering around the local pub. I didn't want to add him for fear of embarrassment. He's a bit tipsy right now...&gt;_&gt;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Armagron runs after Noriko and Lizza as Lizza is swinging her lasso aiming for Joe. Out of nowhere,Lizza's sidekick Rien,tries to catch Noriko.*   is headed for  8O *
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Noriko bolts for the waves, with  8O  (Joe) neatly tucked under her right arm. Diving headfirst into the spray, she swims rapidly away from Lizza and her crazy sidekick. As she swims, she turns her head to looks for    (Rien) He is nowhere in sight. Satisfied, Noriko swims further out to sea, aiming for the depths.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(Lizza, is it just me, or are we the only ones participating in the fun over here?)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(yes) Just then,Noriko turns around to find Lizza and Rien swimming rapidly toward them! Noriko struggles but she is held by Lizza's force! Rien snatches up Joe and takes him to their secret hidout  .(what happened to Armagron?)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(he's...uh...standing on the shore watching the serene ocean waves roll in and out...) Noriko kicks and screams, wanting her Joe back. She tries desperately to escape, and only manages to do so some time after Joe is abducted. It is too late for her to try and figure out where Lizza's secret hideout is. Noriko swims into the safety of the shadows of the kelp. She weeps for the loss of Joe, knowing that she will need help to try and get him back. But who would help me find him? She wonders...

If creating your own country makes you insane, then I should get padding in my room, for not only have I created a country, but a race to populate it (Orcarael, see SoR) their own planet, government, psuedo-religion, history, colonies, enemies, wars, heros, villans, mythology, goals, science, geography, emblem, anatomy, politics, common beliefs, aspirations, law, and language. Language was hardest (Do they say 'blue ball,' or 'ball blue') I also tried to create their own time, and, but for the time being, I give up. (Ok, around their star once is a year. Divide that into segments, divide that into days, divide that into pieces, that into common measurement...)Creating your own country might be insane... living in that country is more insane, though.

AFAIK the rattlesnake was the symbol of the colonies because the only place in the world where rattlesnake was found was the American colonies (and it was quite abundant there).This part is true; However, the second part is that the rattlesnake avoids hostility, it would rather shy away from people than strike at them.

No thank you. Chatterbots aren't my forté. A version of ALICE that could (probably due to memory leaks or some other bugs) run only about 20 minutes before becoming too slow to use comfortably was enough for me. Being ALICE, it used AIML instead of Markov modelling, which meant that it usually sounded almost semi-coherent - and still my mind is forever scarred. A discussion with MegaHAL would probably not be a good thing for my sanity...

Yeah, Patrick Henry rings a bell, that's be his flag then, but I seem to recal a political cartoon with a diced-up snake (each piece named after a colony) saying 'united we stand, divided we fall,' I thought it was done by Franklin.Maybe he was a bad example, he was a busy guy.

(OMG, what have I created!)Meanwhile, on high cliffs overlooking the ocean lies the palace of Smorf. (who, apperently looks like  ) He glances up as Lizza enters the room. Without a word, she holds up  8O (Joe) "Excellent" he declares in a not-so-evil-evil-voice. He tosses 8O (Joe) into a little cage. Before returning to his seat, he grabs   (Rien) and tosses him into his own cage. "Wha?" Lizza mananges to say, coming out of her trance. "Enough of you." Smorf says, and has her thrown into the sea below. (luckily she's a 'phin) Smorf sits down, reassured that his plans are starting to come into focus, when he hears the voice of... The Dreaded One"I keep him in a cage, he represents all the evil thoughts and ideas within me." With this, a large stick comes through the window and pokes Smorf a couple times. "At least it's not the sock, again" snarled Smorf. Nothing could stop him now, except maybe that odd group a dolphins gathering around in a certain reef...

Ah, the tampering of time. So simple an idea, so complex a process. Time travel plays a big part in Part3 (as hinted at in 2A) I don't like the possibilities of time travel opens up (anyone ever see Seven Days?)

And while I'm thinking about that, I just wanted to point out one little thing, which most other people probably wouldn't care about,..but I just found it slightly annoying.  You can't "take a breathe", it doesn't make any sense because "breathe" is an action.  The noun is "breath."  It's a common mistake.Well, anyway, I wanted to finish that fic, or at least what's done so far, before reading any others.  But I have to actually get around to it.For a person who loves to read, I sure don't read much.  Not like I used to.I'd write a fic about Tethys and the Ocean Gaurdians if I had any ideas of what to write.  I love to write but I never have any decent ideas.  It would be hard to write a story about them, anyway.  They don't get directly involved much, mostly just work in the background helping things along.  So it would be hard to write a story where they were the main characters.  But I could write some short little thing about their origin and stuff, about the legend.

Yeah, Patrick Henry rings a bell, that's be his flag then, but I seem to recal a political cartoon with a diced-up snake (each piece named after a colony) saying 'united we stand, divided we fall,' I thought it was done by Franklin.I think I've seen that cartoon on KABA or some such. I'll try and find it later.The flag happens to belong to Colonel Christopher Gadsden, and was first flown aboard a Colonial Troop ship on January 4th, 1776.

Breath and breathe are common problems for me, I always use the wrong one, then catch it on the proof reading (not all the time, apparently) While writing the fic, ideas usually flow better than when planning. I assume about half of my fic came up spur of the moment. But, some planning is needed. Before I even began, I knew how part1 would end, and most of the events that would happen in 2A. Once you start going, it becomes much easier. Work is slow on Part3 because there was too much time between work on 2A and 3. An interesting fact is that Part1 took three months to complete, Part2 maybe three weeks, Prelude in about a day, Part2A in 2-3 days. It all depends on your mood and scedule. My exams start next Friday, and after that, I have nothing better to do than write, which is good because there is a lot for me to write about.

Well I just have a lot of trouble thinking of what to write in the first place.  I can't just start writing out of nowhere, I have to have some clue as to what I'm going to write about.  In order to write the first thing that comes to mind, I have to actually have a first thing come to my mind, and there usually isn't anything.  Even when I can come up with idea, I often have a hard time getting started.  A lot of times I'll know certain things that happen later on, but then I can't get from one point to the next.I used to be able to write and make up the story as I went along.  But I can't seem to do that anymore.I do consider myself a good writer, in fact anybody that reads anything I write always says it's really good.  But I hardly ever write because I have such a hard time coming up with ideas.

8O  o.@;Okay I dunno what it was the Ari did to the story and I dunno wtf that was that Shadow posted.Always wondered who St. Gabreil was... but yeah, what Eao said, any connection to the Songs of Time CD?WTF? What Songs of Time CD?? Never heard of it.And isn't St. Gabriel the name of an actual Saint?  I'm pretty sure that Gabriel was the name of the angel that came to Mary and Joseph.And what's PRH?In any case, I found that story pretty confusing.  I don't understand where this Akren or whatever came from.  Or even where Arkonviox came from.  This Gabriel guy died and then he was reborn but he was called Akren instead? Or something?  I don't get it.  I thought you said Arkon was just an ancient dolphin with special powers or something and there was some experiment involved or something like that.  I might be thinking of a different character.  Ugh, I dunno.  I'm too confused.  But I guess that's not anything new.

Alright folks i dont it! You don't it??  Hm, that's pretty weird.  Never heard of someone "don't-ing" something, but I guess it would be kinda like saying you didn't do it.hehe Well it looks really cool, tho.  I like it a lot.

Noriko wipes her eyes and looks around, wondering where to go to get Joe back. She wipes another tear away with her hand (she's not a 'phin) and swims towards Stenellya and the others (if there are any more besides Stenellya...) Noriko waves at her.    "Hello!" Noriko smiles at Stenellya, forgetting that her eyes are all puffy from crying. x_x A little rainbow coloured fish swims by. (that held absolutely no significance to the story @_o)

I'm sorry, Ari. *hangs her head in shame* But I get the impression that you don't like me too much. It hurts me right here. *puts her hand over her heart*

You're not getting away.Noriko!: No, I'm being called away... to France.Raising a hand to the skies, Noriko! is surrounded by horse and vanishes.

Noriko turns her haed to a loud."Waaaaah!!" Lizza was crying lika a baby! Norikonew that even though Lizza was her enemy,a cry,is a cry. Norikkko Jumped up immediatly and somehow managed to get into the hideout.   (smorf) was asleep,so Noriko had to be quiet. She turned to the corner of the room where she thought she heard the cries,and there was...Lizza!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(sorry 'bout the spelling errors in that last one) 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(quite all right  :D ) Noriko stayed in the safety of the shadows, not wanting to risk waking up the Smorf. She snuck quietly over to Lizza. Looking around nervously, Noriko tapped Lizza softly. Lizza turned around.   "Lizza! Why are you crying? And what happened to Joe?!"Lizza stared at her with a blank expression.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

<div id='container'>
"Shhhh." Replies Lizza. Trust me,you don't want to wake up smorf...Smorf has taken  8O  (Joe) and  (Rien) to a secret dungeon that I don't know 'bout. Quik! Get me outta here and I'll show you the way!(well,so much for making sense  )

<div id='container'>
Hahahaha!  Awsome!!

Noriko gasps at the news. "Lizza! Do you know what this means?!" Lizza shakes her head. Noriko snaps her fingers. "Damn. That really sucks, because I was hoping you could tell me. But I guess it can't be helped." Noriko looks around once more, paranoid that someone might be listening.She opens her mouth, but just before she has a chance to speak, a blood-curdling scream is heard from the next room!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*flicks the plushie dolphin and makes it swing back and forth*

</div>

<div id='container'>
Joooooooooooooe!!!!!!!! Noriko sreamed almost as loud as the scream from the other room. There,in the middle of the room,was Smorf! He had taken Joe and turned him into a clone like himself!  8O     .Noriko and Lizza held onto each other in terror wondering why Smorf had done this to poor little Joe. :(

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Noriko started dancing the Charleston. She looked at Lizza and stopped, realising that this was not the appropriate time. She slowly walked towards Joe, talking to him softly.    "Come on Joe...it's me...it's me...Noriko. You know Noriko, don't you? Remember? You know me...remember those hot, summer days in Czekoslovakia? Or was it Canada? Anyway, locations aren't important. Come on Joe, snap out of it...I love you, Joe. Please come back to me...I would never hurt you...please, Joe..."Noriko slowly put her out to Joe. Joe looked at her inquisitively. Lizza was quiet, watching them, wondering what Joe would do. Suddenly, Joe jumped up and bit Noriko's finger. Noriko jumped back, yelping in pain.    "YOU LITTLE BITCH!" She screamed. She turned to Lizza in rage. "DID YOU SEE WHAT THAT LITTLE MONSTER JUST DID?! HE BIT ME! YOU BASTARD!" Noriko turned to Joe and smacked him sharp across the face. He hit the floor hard. Noriko ran over to him and kicked him repeatedly, swearing at him. "Get up! What's wrong, JOSEPH?! Can't take a little hit?! HUH?! HUH?!?!?!?!" Noriko continued kicking Joe, occasionally spitting on him.

Noriko and Lizza stop when they spy black blook oozing out of Joe's unmentionables. "okay..that's not good." Noriko looks at Lizza. Lizza picks Joe up and brushes him off. "Good as new!" She says, standing him up. And what do you know! He was as good as new! But he was still evil, mind you. Noriko picked him up and squeezed him for no apparent reason. After setting him back down, Lizza and Noriko realised that they were going to need some help getting him back to normal. As they thought of what to do, (with Joe standing in front of them, conveniently asleep) Noriko remembered Armagron. "Oh my gawd! We just left him standing there on the beach! Lizza, what should we do?"But before Lizza had a chance to answer...

Armagron bursts through the door, draws his sword, and lunges for Smorf. He sails right passed him and falls out the window. Using this as a distraction, Artreus enters the room and draws his sword (He has arms at the moment) He looks around the room, trying to figure out who was the bad guy. "You!" he said, and charges for Noriko. "No, no. Him " She says (pointing at Smorf) "What? This little bugger?" Artreus picks up Smorf and pokes him with a finger. "I could not stain my sword with the blood of such a puny foe." He sets Smorf down and pulls out a flyswatter.

St. Gabriel was if im telling this right a Saint who betrayed god and punished.in my story i choose gods punishment as turning him into a dolphin since it seems god likes to turn people into animals anyways.gabriel wreacked alot of havok and god finally just destroyed him but his evil could not be destroyed and it lived in the earth for many years.until atlantis empire was born and a dolphin of the old world atlanteans was born and that dolphin was named akren. akren was killed by the atlanteans much later and it wasnt until an atlantean scientist named atla found akren and knew how powerful he was and decided to genetically alter him and combine him with a technology called the wings of burden.when atla was done with his exparament the dolphin named akren was gone replaced with a new creation who had no memory of his deep past and most of his evil ways were done away with. this dolphin was named after the project which brought him back to life. project Arkonviox.so thats te story. back in the atlanetean days there were many evil threats another one was a dolphin mage too who was killed and thanks to atla reborn as sitna - the mutaclone.gabirel was who akren was akren is who arkonviox was. when your reborn you forget your past and become a new person all that remains is what was incarnated into you. being reborn amkes you a new person and thats what happened to arkonviox.

Curses! Our plots cross again!  an Orcarael. When I created the dolphin persona, I merged it all into one story line, claimng that the Ancients created both the Rising and the Orcarael. Artreus, as a member of the Rising, would be continually reborn until the threat (Vasus) was gone. After it was destroyed, Artreus had no reason to be reborn on earth so was reborn as an Orcarael.The one glitch was: if the same group of seven keeps being reborn and staying together, that would get boring. So they don't remember their previous lives. This applies to all but the last (Orcarael) generation of the Rising, who figure it out eventually.The major advantage of this is I can create any character I want, name him Artreus, and work it into the chronology as another incarnation.

NOOOO! Noriko jumps back, frantically clawing at Joe. Screaming, she manages to pull Joe off of her. Grabbing hold of him firmly, she looks deep into his face. "Aww...Joe! You're back to normal! And I do love yew! But...you bit me." She held her scabbed finger in front of Joe's face. Tears appear in Joe's eyes as he looks at the wound he inflicted upon Noriko. "Noriiiiiiii! I'm so sorry!" Joe sobs as Noriko kneels down and hugs her big-eyed friend. "Aww...it's okay..." Suddenly remembering where she was, Noriko looks for Lizza and Artreus. She sees Artreus smacking Smorf with a flyswatter, with Lizza watching nearby. Noriko puts a hand up to her mouth, stifling her laughter.  "OH NO!" Lizza cries suddenly. "We forgot about Rien!" Joe looks at Lizza, his eyes wider than before.  8O  "Nuuuuuu! We have to save her!" Noriko continues watching Artreus smack Smorf.

(I dub it pure insanity)Artreus tires beating Smorf with a flyswatter. The thought crosses his mind to use a shoe instead. He looks around for a chair to sit on. As he walks across the room toward the chair, he trips over a bewildered Stenellya, who finds herself dragged into the story. Artreus slips out the window, and manages to sheathe the flyswatter before plunging into the waters below. He then forgets what he was doing and decides to swim away.

allowing Joe and Lizza to run around trying to find the place of Rien's imprisonment, Noriko walks over to Stenellya. She looks at Stenellya with a puzzled expression and walks over to the window where Artreus fell. Peering down into the water below, Stenellya comes up behind her and looks out the window as well. Noriko turns around and shrugs. They both start squaredancing.

Star Dagger is one of my 'forbidden fics' (I defined that somewhere) It occurs about halfway in the Artreus-Orcarael timeline. Its the only Orcarael fic I've started to write, but it describes the history of what's already happened and is a pivitol point, reshaping all upcoming events.The title 'Star Dagger' is the nickname of a type of starship I think Amerigo-Class (formerly America, but decided that was a bad idea) With a deadly arsenal and pointed hull, it looks like a dagger.'Death of a Hero' is the point where I blow up the Amerigo, which kills Artreus' fiance' (I realized Artreus of the Orcarael had better things to do than a marrage.)Star Dagger is the reason it took so long to finish Part1 of SoR, and I haven't gotten past the first two segments. (Which are about 1000 words each)Now that I've told you more than you needed to know, I shall..........something something.

Suddenly, the doors open, revealing the soaking and disarmed form of Armagron. With a look of purpose in his eyes, he walks across the room, carefully avoiding the window. He finds Smorf's computer and turns it on. After several minutes of waiting, it connects to the internet. He quickly browses through, takes a quick stop at a cyber pub, and enters an unmarked forum. Noriko and Stenellya try to see over Armagron's shoulder. All they manage to see iswinkarrow:)Ah! Inspiration!*quickly moves to another topic*He hits the print botton. He stands up and stretches, then walks for the door. He slips and falls out the window again.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Noriko runs to the window. She slams it shut. "OKAY! How many people are going to fall out of this god forsaken contraption?!" She turns and looks at Stenellya. After watching Stenellya stare at her for a minute, Noriko goes and looks at the printed page. "Hey! It's Rien!" Dumbly, she puts her hand on the paper and tries to pull Rien off of the sheet. She accidentally rips the page in two. "Oops..." She holds half the paper and sees that in the message, there is an arrow. She holds it higher up and follows the direction that the arrow is pointing to. (stupidly enough, she doesn't realise that every time she turns, she points the arrow in a new direction) She wanders down a flight of stairs, all the time watching the arrow on the page, not looking where she is going.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
She then runs into another open window and with Lizza running to catch her,they both fall into the icy ocean.(now the're popsicles!)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
As they land in the ocean, Noriko cries out "Not another window! Who is so irresponsible as to leave windows open everywhere?!" The paper she was holding flies up from beneath her and smacks her in the face (x_x; ). They hit the water and foam splashes everywhere, dunking them underneath.. They can't see anything for a brief moment, as millions of bubbles rush past them to the surface. Noriko swims up quickly and looks around, the water crashing against the rocks around them. She sees Joe, Stenellya and Rien watching them from the window high above them. Another rainbow coloured fish swims by who, again, holds absolutely no significance whatsoever to the story.

Who voted "no" in the poll? I need to know why you said no.I think I'll start with this plan soon and try and get it off the ground. I might just host it on my Shaw web space. But what's important right now, is the forms. I've never used forms, so I don't know how they work. I want it so the information filled out get's sent to me. But the thing I don't get is this CGI directory? What is that? Can anyone help me out with making the forms?If you don't know how to make forms... the site needs a name! Give me your imputs on what it should be called!

<div id='container'>
Noriko floats in the water next to Lizza, the cold sea spray splashing on her face. She rises and falls with the current, the sea becoming angrier as the dark clouds roll in overhead. The sky becomes gloomy and dark, and the waves crash more violently against the rocks. Silently, Noriko waits for somebody to post something to continue the story besides herself.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
do not worry, Noriko, i bet the ones i give are even easier   how about this one, for instance?cowthemeclaimhotenefour words

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*snickers*   As Noriko and Lizza wait there in the icy waters,they can see smorf standing behind the group in the window (god not another one) He pushes them all out the _____ing window,and seals the entrance to the hideout."Now what?" asked Noriko. Suddenly out of nowhere........
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A giant killer shark bursts through the foam and lunges at Noriko! It's jaws gaping, it's eyes covered with...those...protective eye covering thingies! Quickly, Noriko jumps out of the way! The shark misses! Just before the shark has a chance to lunge at anyone else, Noriko grabs a very conveniently placed spear and hurls it at the shark! The spear gorges the shark's eye, spurting blood all over the place! Noriko beats her chest in triumph and the mighty fish swims frantically away, blood trailing from it's maimed eyeball! "I AM NORIKO! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" She laughs maniacally! "Feel my anger and fear my wrath! Flee, foul sea beast!  MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" The entire group stares at her in silence. The waves crash against the rocks. They move with the tide...up and down...up and down. They stare at each other in silence. Finally, Lizza swims for the shore where the tower lies, followed by the rest of the group. (how's that for a little action? WHOOOO!  8O )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(Artreus! You've created a monster!  :D  A very fun monster, I might add. &gt;_&gt;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The group then realizez that open windoes are good,because if they could only reach the window,they could get back in the hideout. When the group gets to shore,they throw a party for Noriko for her triumphant defeat! "Yaaaaay!" they all yell.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(YAY! A PARTY!) Noriko dances insanely.  She trips and falls flat on her face in the sand. She ignores her fall and rolls in the sand, making weird noises. "Pbbbththhthhththhhh!"  She...um...spits? Anyways, the others are all coming up with a plan to get back to the windows, while Noriko chases after some seagulls. Noriko turns to the group and yells at them. "Hey! How come seagulls don't fly over the bay?!" They all stare at her. "Because then they'd be BAGELS!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" Noriko laughs hysterically at her own joke. She clutches her sides, still laughing. She is laughing so hard that she can no longer hold herself up, and she falls onto the sand. She falls asleep as soon as she hits the sand. She snores loudly as the waves washes over her. x_x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
They ignore her for the moment. (sorry Noriko) The group get a good idea from Noriko's joke. If they could gether up enough seagulls,they could fly into the window! Noriko was still laying there murmering to herself,the joke over and over,"Why don't seagulls fly over the bay? Because they'd be BAGELS! Why don't seagulls fly over the bay? Because they'd be BAGELS!! Why don't....."

Noriko Heh dont let me get into incarnations. after Arkon was reborn from akren he was split up into seven incarnations. each incarnation was hidden throughout time. Monark the arkon of fire was sent into the past and became known as the dolphin god of war living aside apollo the dolphin god - who has a true purpose behind him to linking him with ecco.then theres arknovious the arkon who resembles more of a sea serpant shape. this arkon isnt like the others because its made of an element called strata which makes it the most powerful arkon. problem is arknovious has no intelengce its a beast. Arknovious was sent to the future but after being sent arknovious used its power to open a worm hole in time and vanished. the only way to find arknovious is to travel to the point he vanished. then theres arkonokta arkon of earth, arky (bludnercaves incarnation) whos the arkon os ice and a female arkon whos the arkon of water. then arkonviox who remained in the present and became the arkon of lightning.if arkonviox combines with all his incarnations he achives a greater power and becomes arkonviox 2. (arkonviox in his second form)later in my story arkonviox 2 becomes killed and in death finds two more arkons who he never knew about ghangis khan and diablos. ghengis khan seeks to be reborn and diablos tries to stop him. ghengis is shocked to see his incarnation arkonviox has died and seeks out a new power to kill arkon and diablos giving him a power of life. but diablos combiens with arkonviox 2 making arkonviox become arkonviox 3. http//arkonviox.com/tassartwork/img/atla.jpg thats atlahttp//arkonviox.com/tassartwork/img/arknoremake.jpg - arknovioushttp://arkonviox.com/tassartwork/img/tass2001_arkonviox3.jpg arkonviox 3the earth clan is the biggest story, the mutaclone seeks out a great power to change himself to perfect to perfection to his final form sitna.ecco embarks on a big quest to stop sitna with apollo and this brings the biggest ecco the dolphin story ever.

Its good to see it all in one place, what I've known about the Arkonviox plot came from various scattered bits and pieces. Most of my plot is invested in the post-Rising scenarios were Artreus is no longer a dolphin (mostly) but I find by intertwining them all adds interesting possibilities.

writing about an evil dolphin is hard I tell you!sure, anyone can write an ecco fic....but an 'evil' dolphin...eh?yeah, I had a story with " a land that was tooo nice, it was it's undoing "meaning, if Us americans let people walk over us...they will overthrow us all.*parinoid sweat*

Even more to share:*dusts off a book*Pelorus Jack- Ship's PilotNew Zealand porpoise. For 40 years, begining in 1872, a porpoise guided ships through the tricky channel in New Zealand waters. His name was Pelorus Jack. In 1903, while Jack was piloting the ship Penguin, a passenger shot the dolphin,  Jack left for two weeks, then came back healed up, but he never piloted the Penguin again. In 1909 the Penguin was wrecked in the channel.

Ha. *Mumbles incoherently* "Soon I will kill you....And anyways, I would love to see a movie about Ecco.....It would sure be better then that bullshit about some kid and his godamn whale or some kid and his godamn dolphin.....Every damn movie about sea creatures has some anoying little six year old in it, and how he is full of angst for various different reasons. Then, the sea creature comes, and makes his life all happy. NO. That is not acceptable. If ecco saw that kid in free willy, he would probly slap that bitch around for being trapped in a godamn tank, not being able to save the world. Now THAT I would like to see.

Lizza starts to pout at hearing this short lesson in French. (Anything that falls into this topic becomes fair game) Stenellya turns to the drunken dolphin. "Hey, aren't you Phosis?" A look of absolute fear crosses his face, and he bolts away. (just trying to keep authentisity) "NO!" the 'phins look up as they hear the scream from Smorf's palace. "BAYGULLS! AAAHHH!!! SUCH A BAD JOKE!" (no offence) Smorf bursts out a window in the wall, hands over his ears, and plunges into the ocean bellow. Two merfolk (Don't see them much, do ya) dive after him and begin a game of hacky-sac. Just as the group tries to deal with this, Armagron manages to fall out another window somehow.

*Has nothing better to do than start a new topic*The Genesis Project, (the Ecco1 and 2 fanfics) has been on hold for a while. But when school lets out for me (about a week or two) I'll have nothing better to do than write the fics. SoR Part3 has priority now, but as soon as that's done, I'll start on my half- Ecco2.So the point is this: Are there any scenes/levels/points that you want to see in the fics? There is a lot to cover in the two games, and I don't want to leave out a scene someone was looking forward to reading.I've given a heads up to Phosis, who plans on working on the Ecco1 fic, so feel free to drop any requests for Ecco1 too.

Asteritius: Prove it. Many claim that they are insane, but few actually have any means to back it up. Randomness is not sufficient; shouting "THE SHAI-HULUD IS COMING!!!" in the middle of a serious discussion is not sufficient. Just saying that you're insane is definitely not sufficient. Laughing insanely in a normal style is not sufficient (though, for example, the Istvanistani mad laughter, GWARDIHARHAR//// (yes, those are slashes, not bangs) is enough in some cases)So, the stage is yours. Give us a display of insanity. Remember, we're pragmatists... we will not believe you before you present us satisfactory proof.

(Psst... Eao, I think you forgot something)Stenellya, to tell you the truth, I thought it made sence at the time. I took it to mean 'It's in your lap,' which I guess would mean something like 'it's your problem now.'Also, I thought it could be in reference to a relay: you pass off the baton to Eao, who now runs her lap.You still speak better english then some people I know. Granted, one's from Columbia, but I've meet a few Americans who can't speak it well anyway.

Yeah, I know) )Song of the Ancients is unique in that it follows and actual pattern, it's a sonnet (Elizabethan I believe) Well, I just sent 2 new poems to Arkon for ya'll to check out. If they aren't there yet, my two old ones are waiting for you anyway. This is probably the most inspiration I will ever have in writing poetry for fun, (well... save maybe the Orcarael Battle Hymn) so tell me what you think//arkonviox.com/enigma.php?id=fanfare:fanlibrary_artreus#fanpoetry

Whew! Haven't even looked at the OT forum in a while!Actually we didn't go to the cottage this weekend, but I busied myself playing Grandia II, which I rented for the weekend.  It's a great game, I like it a lot and now I want to get it if I can.Well I just wanted to comment on the "dry heat" thing.  It really DOES make a difference, beleive me!  It's really humid here, and it's about twice as humid in Florida(at least it seems that way).  We've been to Florida a lot since my grandparents moved there.  It's usually warmer there anyway, but in the summer the temp's not much different. Here it feels about 10 degrees hotter than it actually is, and in Florida it feels about 20 degrees hotter.  "Here" is Michigan, btw, in case you couldn't figure out "the giant mitten" under my location.A few years ago we went to Yellowstone in Wyoming.  Well it's really dry there.  On the last day, which we actually spent in Cody, we were just walking about to look at stores and stuff, and we came across a marquis that said it was, I think, something like 120 degrees.  To us it felt more like 80!  So, humidity really does make a LOT of difference.  So to those of you living out there where "at least it's dry heat" and it gets to 120 degrees with a humidity level of about 10% or lower (whatever it usualy gets to there) try coming here when it's 98 degrees and the humidity level is about 90-100% (or sometimes more)!Actually it hasn't gotten to 98 yet this year, but it used to get around there quite often.

Suddenly bolting up from the sand, Noriko grabs a GIANT bagel from...out of nowhere. She thrusts it underneath the window that Armagron fell out of, and he lands with a soft "thud" on the round bakery confection. She starts munching on the corners, spreading cream cheese on various parts of the bagel. Luckily, Armagron gets off the bagel before she reaches him. Finished with her snack, Noriko turns around as the others contemplate what the hell to do now. She sees the merfolk playing hackey-sack with Smorf and runs to go join them (heck...she's almost a mermaid anyways). She dives into the water and swims for them. The merfolk see her coming and laugh; this particular bunch knows Noriko. Meanwhile...the rest of the group eats pieces of Noriko's giant bagel because...they're hungry. o_o

I SWEAR my computer is POSSESSED!It JUST happened!Every SINGLE day the very second midnight hits (according to the computers' clock) it goes and opens up one or two, sometimes more, random things.  It never opens a new program, except there has been times it's opend Exlporer but I'm already connected w/ AOL anyway.  But it does open something in whatever program is in use.  For example, it will open something from AOL, like it might open Help.  And this time, I was working in FrontPage, and the computer started acting like it was loading something (which is how it always starts) and then the file menu dropped down, when my mouse wasn't anywhere near it, I saw an item highlited but it did it too fast for me to see what, and then the Open dialouge box popped up.  I just watched it do this!The past severel days it's just opened the internet properties dialouge box, but it's always behind everything else so I don't see it until I close all the programs. I just checked and it did that this time, too.Oh, and it actually tried to open a file, too, but I closed the Open box before it could do anything.  But it acted like it was trying to open something.  Then when I tried to save the page I was working on, it said it couldn't save on such-and-such a drive or whatever.  But I hit the Save icon again and it worked.This thing must be possessed.  And it may have something to do with all the problems we've had with this stupid computer lately.And actually, it started doing this several months ago, so it's not something that's always happened.

I bet you have some sort of malware or trojan thats gotten passed to you. Its quite common these days. Do a virus checkup (you *do* have an anti-virus package, don't you?), that should pick up anything thats common.Random use of menus sounds like a remote control malware.Well, it's been doing this for several months like I said, and we run the anti-virus scan periodically.  It's never found anything before.I forgot to mention one other thing.  When I noticed this the first time, a program called "Cleanie" would open automatically right at 12.  It would just say "Cleanie" on the toolbar, but that was all it really did, it didn't open in a window, just appeared on the toolbar and then it'd go away after a few seconds.  I thought this "Cleanie" thing had something to do with it, but lately it hasn't popped up and it's still doing the same thing.  I haven't even thought about it much before now, because during the school year I was never on at midnight except on weekends.  And even then I just thought it was nothing.  But it doesn't seem to be hurting anything.  We've been having a lot of problems with the computer lately, but I think it's just cuz it's getting old and because we have so much stuff on the harddrive.  But this "Cleanie" thing is kinda weird because I never saw an icon for it anywhere.  It just seemed to appear out of nowhere.  I would have asked my mom about it, but the only time I thought of it was when it actually popped up, and now it hasn't even been appearing.

And I'll use this chance for stating my opinion... In my more humble opinion, Ari Rahikala (yes, spelled without the extra k) is an incredibly cool name. I don't know why. The name just contains the essence of coolness.I once sent a "friend" of mine a (very amateurish, due to the fact that I wrote it in ten minutes) program that prompted him to write my last name, and to write it correctly. It encouraged right answers (that is, my name being spelled correctly) and discouraged wrong answers by a library of 40... er... interesting phrases (20 phrases for right answers and 20 phrases for wrong answers). Too bad I can't send it to you before I get home...

<div id='container'>
And just to elaborate on that post... A quote from httpBut a scientist from Brookshire, Edward Rupen, refused to let this daunt him. Working with a dolphin named Zhaki, he developed a Common-Dolphin dictionary, and managed to open negotiations between Kaiser Gaelen II and the leader of the most influential pod of dolphins in the Halberd Strait, whose name can be approximated in Common as Ari (although his last name, no matter how expert the translation, still continues to sound like random dolphin clicks).

Arkon and Shadow would be the best battle. That I would like to see.But come on Delphi and Tethys. Two of the most anti-fighting people on here.Actually another fight I'd like to see would be Cally and Trellia. That would be interesting to see play out!

<div id='container'>
yeh, well, I figured that those strong arm-like things had to be for something! =)

Arkonviox vs. Shadow.Now that would totally kick ass.Who would win? I know who I'd place my money on, but I'm not saying because I'll be thrown outta this forum faster than I can say, "I meant you, honest!"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh if we can keep going on this well have a new vote to decide who would win between blank and blank.

Arkon, I sorta pictured you floating through the water... thats the way I wrote in my fanfic. As for crestoe, I made him croc-swim cause of those weird little legs. Go figure

At twenty pounds, the Sperm Whale has the largest brain of any animal. Humans, in comparison, have a four pound brain.The Blue whale is the largest animal to ever live, including all dinosaur and prehistoric shark species. (I take this for granted, but I'll put it up anyway)And, while I'm on the subject:I'm pretty sure humans and dolphins (or ceteceans in general I should probably say) are the only animals that have a cerebral cortex.  I know that most animals don't have it, so I'm pretty sure humans and ceteceans re the only animals that do.I believe all animals have a cerebral cortex, but in most its very small. In higher inteligent life it is much larger. The other portion (cerebellum, I think) controls function as oppossed to thought, so therefore is larger in many animals.*Prepping for next week's Bio exam*

Arkon and I fighting each other.. That would be interesting indeed. Too bad it would go something like this:&lt;Dolphin&gt; arkon, you are now disconcerted, and thus you shal proceed to weep with infernal rage at your self-unfavorablity.&lt;Arkonviox&gt; o_o;;;&lt;Arkonviox&gt; kill me o-O* Dolphin shoots arkon to end his suffering.

Well damn arkon you always edit my posts.  Well at least this way you have the choice whether or not you want to have it burned on to your eternal soul.Of course this isn't that bad as far as hentai goes, even while considering the disturbing greenness of that penis.  Most people would actually consider it fine entertainment, and of course these are the sort of people who should be beaten with a pipe as soon as possible.Siskel Yes it is, since its an animated looping gif, you can watch it for however long it takes for you to masturbate to it!  Though as much as its action packed, i must say that the acting is supurb as well!Siskel I give it 8 cartoon cocks.Siskel: I give it 9 animated assholes.Shit.

sorry I think you have a virus...check for worms....and get Norton. Mcaffee sucks...If all else fails, do a good ol' reformatWe HAVE Norton!It's possible that we have a virus since Norton wasn't working, but it's not what I was talking about here.Because what it was that was causing stuff to open is NOT a virus.  When I said that Cleanie program hadn't been coming up, well it is now, and I think had been all along, I just didn't notice it cuz it goes away after a couple seconds.  I mentioned Cleanie to my mom this time and she says it's an installed program.  In fact, I used Find and when I found the folder it's in, I discovered it's something that goes along with Window Washer, which is a program that cleans out stuff.  The Window Washer comes up every time the computer is started up.  And Cleanie comes up at midnight, it probably just waits a specified number of hours.  So they're both scheduled pretty much.  And they're just cleaning programs.  For some reason Cleanie always opens the Internet Properties dialouge box, and sometimes it might open something else.  My mom may not have been able to get Norton to work, but I was able to scan Cleanie individually, and found nothing.  At first I thought it was peculiar that it has no icon, but there's a few other things that don't have icons.  I know it's Cleanie that's opening stuff because when I found it in Explorer and opened it, it did the same thing.So THAT'S not a virus.  But that doesn't mean we don't have one..

...Artreus hit the rock hard, and was stunned momentarily. Vasus saw the opportunity and thrust with his staff. Artreus cried out as it pierced his chest. Light leaked from the wound, just as before.Vasus leaned forward."You've failed, Artreus."I couldn't resist throwing this in. I wrote it in a study hall today and it will appear at the end of Part 3. The scene has a large gap in the middle, (The actual blow-by-blow description) I'll write that latter.

From the European History Exam: Part 1 (possibly 2001)77. In the early 1950s the French Government tried to(A) ban the use of "Americanisms" like le weekend.(B) ban the importation of Coca Cola for fear it would damage the French  wine industry.(C) stop stores from using any language other than French in their store windows.(D) ban the importation of American dairy products such as Velveeta.(E) ban all British products from French stores unless they can be reinspected for contaminants.I answered E and got it wrong, the correct answer was B, and it was justified as spread of American culture.I believe this is what you were talking about.Of course, I wasn't around in the early 50's to give an eyewitness account.

something relatively related....I had norton 95 up until a few months ago....I suspected I had a virus, but norton wasnt showing it...plus, it was updated, so i thought I didnt....After awhile, my comp started getting really bad, so I went out and got norton 2000. Right away, without updating, it showed me 5000 files infected by the Ninmda worm, and Hai 32 that Norton 95 did not locate, even with the updates! I also had 2 backdoor trojans.....crazy eh?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, it is Norton 2000 that we have.  But since it wasn't working, it's possible there still may be a virus...or else there's just something wrong with it.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Maybe get Norton 2002 if you suspect a virus

Me and Delphi? o.o; Why?  I don't see how that works.You could have at least capitalised my name! &gt;.&lt;Arkon and Shadow would be interesting...I don't imagine either one would give up.  Artreus and Phosis might be kinda interesting, too, cuz...they kinda remind me of...each other...sometimes.

I would imagine any kind of art would count as fanart as long as it fits in with an aquatic theme. Anyway, about the avatar requests...You already did that other nice one for me, how about doing another one with Tethys' new look?  :D  Just look at my fanart, it's the one that looks like a purple elasmosaur with a funky tail.  It would be great if you could animate it.

The day began with a sky of gold and red. Dark clouds covered the west while a golden sun watched down on a clan of dark orcas getting ready to attack three dolphins who gaurd edens mountain where the battle of perfection mustaclone, crestoe, ecco, and apollo take place.One dolphin wore a golden mask with skin of a tan brown. The mask looked like an atelope with horns and ears and snarling nostrils. The dolphin also had a sharp dorsal rasor and fins made out of long sharp metal. The tail on this dolphin was covered in feathers much like a birds tail. He was Arkonviox, known be the savoir of the future. He was an old world atlantean dolphin.Arkonviox was with two other dolphins who looked much how he did. The other two had masks resembling a antelope type creature. One of the dolphins was a small dorf . The dorf looked much like a smaller Arkonviox. In fact his name was Arky and next to him was another dolphin with a fair blue skin and a mask of purple and turqiose. She was a female, her name was unknown but what we do know she was strong and always stood by the dorf arky. It was clear the three dolphins were somehow related. They even acted and worked together as if they were one being.On the other end where the renewed clan of seven dark whales. They all looked very much the same, ther eleader was the smallest named Napolean, then the largest was one who had no name except Dark Orca. Seven Dark Whales, seven lost treasures, seven for the secret never to be told.Arkonviox looked his old allie Dark Orca in the eyes. The being reunitied brought alot of emotions between the two but they knew there would be no time for short hellos- they were enemys by fate this time.Then above them a dolphin with a red mask of a bull appeared. He too resembled the arkons with grey skin. He looked down at Arkonviox and smirked."Hello younger brother!", yelled Monark to Arkonviox."You arent my brother, i found out owr familys secret.", Arkonviox looked up protecting the two of his friends who stood behind him in terror."Oh...so you did! Then you know i'm gonna kill you and owr little brohter and sister who your protecting so i can achieve my second form. I been told for many years one day youd come and face me and destroy me so you could reclaim and achieve your full power. well Arkonviox what if i defied the devine rules and i achieved that power? Then i could destroy Apollo and Mutaclone and Ecco and become the supreme god of dolphin kind! Mwa ha ha you fool, why don't you just shut the fuck up and surrender yourself to me!"Arkonviox watched Napolean as he held back his orcas who were eager to kill the three Arkons. Then Moanrk looked down aware they were becoming impatient."Napolean i gathered you two here to show you what my power can help you achieve. The seven dark whales have rejoined for one purpose to revive the greatest Dark whale of them all. So i present to you Armageddon."The ground began to rumble and hell opened up exposing itself and out of the fire rose an orca connected to many metal red and black tubes with a helmet over his head with red eyes. The tubes helped revive him and conencted to through out his body keeping him alive. Destroying him may seemed simple if it were the fact he could  not be destroyed.Dark Orca the largest dark whale looke dto napolean."This is your strongest dark whale?! I knew him once...you can't trust him and he is not all that strong! Can't you see we been had," Dark orca yelled."Thats where your wrong my simple orca friend. Armageddon has become alot stronger and powerful because of my power to awaken him. WHat you once kenw about him is wrong for everything you see has been hieghtened 1000 times. He is the ultimate weapon!" monark replied."No! I knew him once he served in the original 7 dark whale clan long ago when i was young. I will never forgot what he did nor will i forgive him. I havent forgotten you Muerte." Dark orca looked dead in the eyes of the ultimate weapon."Dark orca stop what your doing, were here to destroy arkonviox to repay Monark for what he has helped us do." Napolean swam up to Dark orca and looked at him."I can see in your eyes you arent listening me i can feel you want to stop this. I have no choice then, i must stop you before you screw up everything we ever dreamed. The dream of orca rule....sad to say you'll have no part!" Napolean charged up a red energy and rammed into dark orca. The red energy allowed Napolean to become more razor like. Dark Orca moved out of the way but as Napolen fell past him the currents from the charge made blood fall out of a small wound on dark orcas face.Dark orca looke dat Napolean and laughed."Mwa ha ha, you are too stupid. All this time you were unaware i could destroy you and your intire clan with one attack. Its time to end the dark whales once and for all! then when you and the clan are gone i will kill Armageddon and then Monark then i will help Arkonviox destroy Mutaclone." Dark Orca charged up an energy so powerful it caused the ocean to shake an out of the sky lightening to flash. Arkon the dark orcas even monark developed a cold feeling and ebgan to feel weak."Heh just watch and witness what a horrible death feels like"Little spots of light started randomly appearing of different sizes they soon began to gather at the tip of Dark Orcas lips. Dark orca heald his head up and the flares grew from a black light into one great black lught sphere."Omega Flare" Dark Orca yelled out."What nonsense are you yelling?" Napolean yelled out. Amargeddon watched with Monark right next time him. They seen Napolean and the dark orcas and knew they were about to face there deaths.Dark orcas giant flare sphere became transparent its energy could be felt but it could not be seen. The vibrations was all that could be seen from above Dark Orcas, lips he tasted victory and then everything was silent and the trembling stopped."Mwa ha ha ha!""Seven...Dark....Whales....Forever!" dark orca laughed as he mocked his clan. Then suddenly smaller flare spheres appeared near each dark orca clan member. the flare spheres consumed them and destroyed them all. Dark Orca looked at Armageddon who watched without any expression with his leader Moanrk at his side. Monark was freaked out.Below Arkonviox, the dorf arky, and there sister watched in terror. Dark Orca, Arkonviox's old allie just became one of the good guys again."Muerte, i destroyed you once i shall destroy you again!" Dark Orca snarled to Armageddon.Arkonviox felt he couldnt stand still he had to do soemthing. One thing came to mind. Monark stood there watching dark orca and Armageddon fight. Monark the arkon with the red bull mask. Destroying him would be great.Arkonviox swam up towards monark, Monark jumped out of the water and began to levetate aove the sea. Arkonviox levetated himself higher up then fell down like a bird swooping its prey. As arkon fell charging into monark, monark formed a sphere of fire and hell an attacked called "Oblivion" the sphere was a hole opening the gates to hell bringing forth a fire fury which pulled arkon in and continully attacked him.Arkonviox knew the way to get out of this attack was to pull off an ultimate attack of his own. The "Supreme". the attacked appeared over his beak a sphere of lightning grew larger and larger and larger then as Arkonviox yelled a scream of fury the attack blew the sphere up allowing light to emerge and counter monarks oblivion and even hurt monark."Thats an old attack Moanrk, Apacalypes may have destroyed me with that before but years of regenration tought me how to counter it. Eat this bitch!"Arkonviox pointed both of his fins forward and opened them much like a bird opens its wings when it does a giant flap. What emerge was two energy missles an attack called "Splitrockets" which hit monark like razors and exploded on him.Monark emerged even more weak then when he began."Arkon, how? how did you become so powerful?" Monark then looked down at Armegeddon and smirked.Below Armageddon had Dark orca beaten down to nothing."Arkon!" yelled dark orca.Arkonviox looked at Monark who was weakened and went to Dark Orcas aid. Armageddon quickly turned and charged for Arkonviox."Stop!" Yelled Monark. "Destroy Arkons friends instead.""NOOOO" Arkonviox yelled!Armageddon instead looked up towards monark and threw a single protetile which destroyed monark."Monark has no control over him." Dark orca yelled."Monarks dead!" Arkonviox replied back."How do you know?""I felt his power join me."Arkonviox looked at armageddon and used Moanrks Oblivion attack on him."Ha ha when he died i gained his power."Dark Orca looked at armageddon who fell to the sea floor trying to clear his eyes from the dust clouds. Dark Orca then looked at the 2 other arkons he was protecting.The dorf arkon yelled to arkonviox "Yeah get him Arkonviox! Ha ha"Armageddon heard the voice of the little dorf and went for him. Arkonviox tried to go over to stop armageddon but was to slow. Armageddon licked his lips finding the female arkon behind the dorf arkon."STay away!" The little dorf shot an energy blast that kinda smacked armageddon.Arkonviox swam down the armageddon went to turn but was smacked into the rock before he could do anything.Armageddon mimmicked the oblivion attack he witnessed before and made arkon fall to the ground weaken. Armageddon went for the dorf and female arkon again then dark orca charged into him. Armageddon lifted his fin and smacked Dark Orcas neck broken.Arkonviox pulled himself off the ground and watched as Armageddon bit the heads off the dorf and female. "NOOO! why! you fucker! you wont get away with this!" Arkonviox yelled hopeless.Armageddon began to laugh an evil giggle and looke dtowards arkon. The left over parts of the arkons who were kileld began to vanish and combined into Arkonviox.Armageddon looke dat Arkonviox who had a rock piled on his tail, Arkonviox was trapped. He tried everything to pull free but as Armageddon appraoched he gave up and closed his eyes. he knew he was about to be killed.But then soemthing happened. Arkonviox began to feel the pain of all the Arkons who were killed. This was a feeling of a power that was once separated now returned. Arkonviox was whole again.Arkonviox's eyes glew and his body began to change and the screaming pain brought a sensation of ultimate power. Arkonviox had changed his mask wa snow silver his fins once a plain metal were now molded into an almost metallic birds wings. his dorsal razor had became sharper he was indeed more powerful and almost more robitic looking.Arkonviox then looked at at amrageddon and smirked. Armageddon wasnt impressed then Arkonviox swam up above the sea and looked down at armageddon."Ultimate Supreme."Arkonviox began to form a more powerful version of his supreme attack. A giant sphere began to form larger then arkonviox so hudge it vegan to suck air into it and turn it into energy. Arkonviox threw the attack down and it pilled untop of Armageddon. The giant sphere fell and consumed Armageddon and swollowed him then began to puncture into the earth and explode.Arkonviox was all alone, he relized his ultimate power could only be achieved if all his brothers and sisters where killed. The pain of there deaths came from the fact that they had joined him and not relly have died. They were the incarnations of arkonviox -ultimate power- Arkonviox looked up edens mountain.

This isn't true. Coca-cola did contain cocaine, as did thousands of other patent medicines of that time, but the amounts were very small - by 1902 only about one grain of cocaine per four hundred ounces of Coca-cola syrup. See http//www2.netdoor.com/~davidroy/cocacola.html for information about Coca-cola's history.

There is nothing wrong with this great forum in which I post in. Your problem probably exists because of my presence here, in this forum, which I speak of.(Arkon, next time you edit my posts, could you at the very least capitalise your 'I's?)Arkon saysPAri says: But we could continue playing this game for a long time, Arkon...

Crashing waves, crying gulls and the wind racing them, all is quiet save for these sounds and that of the pod of dolphins, herding a shoal of fish into a death trap.  Silvery bodies twist and glisten, turn and shine with every move, like blades in an eternal dance.  Despite this peaceful, serene something, is looming in the darkness, something not very right.  Keep left! shouts Jeriu, Dash ahead up two feet! Gerio squeals and ads, Let no smelt have a chance to get away!  The pod leader takes his commands and rounds up the future dinner, and herds them into a death trap of sweetly smiley jaws.  If you must die, die by the lips of a smiling foe.A Yearling female goes to surface and open her maw to allow the frightened fish to enter the trap.  OOOOF Assskerrrrr! she screams in pain as a gray dash zooms past her and greedily snaps up her quarry.  How dare you, you rouge! her mate screams, he readies his body to charge a counter strike, but with a sly grin and a dry laugh the intruder zips away, joining the heavens and thwarting his attack.Are you fine, my dear sweat? Yaloe asks his bruised female, slightly sighing in discomfort she repliesI think Ill be fine, but what may I ask was that? Bobbing his head in confusion Yaloe answers Im not sure, it was kin, but no kin of my family would ever attack another, its a crime for one to attack someone, who is in as delicate of a condition as you are. Yaloe gently nuzzles his mates bloated  tummy.As the two seek help within each other, five or so dolphins set out to search the area, soaring in a frantic, angry mannerthis attacker will not go unpunished, once found justice will be served.Slightly glittering, acceding into the reefs and abysses, the rogue dolphin seeks a hide away, brewing anger from the fact that she is being hunted. Damn, and all I wanted was some easy breakfast, now they seek to kill me she thought.  Deeper into twisting, sunken ravines, she finds soft, innocent shedding lobsters. What a shame this dolphin is not a vegetarian saints.  But life is life, and in the wild there are no laws but to live, she snaps up the now soft seabug. Being an air-breathing animal, she soon has to surface for air.  The breaching at sunset is a beautiful sight, a sleek aquatic body, reaching for the stars and falling, twisting in an acrobatic mannerit seems almost in slow-motion this act.  When she lands the sky is already dark blue, white stars dribbled across the sky like tiny eyes, millions of eyes watching over all live on earth.  The dolphin surfaces again, dancing across the moon, she has a scar that looks like a star on her head, water flowing off her body makes her look like she is ripping diamonds from the sky, the star glistens in the Ivory-silver moonlight.  She stole the sun, she is Eao-Eoraptorthe Dawn that takes its own fire away, she is a loner, and soon to embark on a life experience that no man nor beast could phantom!	The next day all the sea was abuzz with sightings and encounters of Eao, frantic songs sent great shock of in habitants and wrouht many hearts in strong fear.  Even the seas most fierce warriors and predators shook in there fins.  Yesssssss..I have seenn herrrrrr Said the sea serpent, via a form of telepathy unknown to land apes (humans) sheee hass tried to sever me inn two..And for the reason to consume my fleshhhhh  Adding to the witnesss story a small shark joined in Despite conflect between our kind, Eao to as brought an uncalled for attack, day by day I await my death.  For my injuries have left me dangling by a painful, thin thread Jeriu

so there are no he or she in other languages?everone is an 'it' but a floor can be masculain?damn....even the romance languages make no sence.The situation is rather simple with Finnish... There are no masculines or feminines, only a distinction between pronouns that refer to humans (personal pronouns) and pronouns that refer to other things (demonstrative pronouns). Not needing to write "he or she" everywhere makes life easy.

<div id='container'>

After rereading the thread and gaining a new understanding over Stenellya's question.I can tell you that Coca-Cola is sold nearly world wide (I know for a fact its in China) and when you mass produce any product, it requires a lot of supply. Also, Coca-Cola doesn't just make Coca-Cola. They own Cherry Coke (makes sence) and Sprite, possibly many more. (Don't believe me? I have a can of Sprite in front of me that says 'Canned under authority of Coca-Cola company,' look it up)

It works. It's a good start, I look forward to its continuation. I've been interested in learning more about your character (for reasons yet to be revealed) and I'm glad I'll now have the opportunity.

I can't draw,  :? so I write. Poetry is ok, but seeing how mine's all free verse... I say it doesn't count but others would disagree. I prefer the stories.Speaking of which, Part3 is coming again strong I've given up writing it in order, I'll write the segments, then piece 'em together later and fill in the gaps. After SoR, I'll get to work on Tides of Time, which I'm looking forward to because after that, I'll write one called Collisions (at the moment) , which should be interesting. I've also just given myself the green light on yet another story completely unrelated to the others with an odd twist. Currently in planning are another set of characters for another story, or possibly a series that, if I give it the go ahead, will be made after Collisions. So thats... Three upcoming fics for sure out of a total of Five.  8O  I've gotta get these tests over with and start writing and hope my printer doesn't die. (These things could be worth a couple brownie points if I show 'em to an English teacher)

A blonde girl was standing in the shade of a nearby tree, when she noticed a horse standing by her. Looking around her and seeing nobody, she walked over to the horse, excited; she had never ridden one before. She climbed up on the steed's back and it started walking. Looking around her with eyes wide in excitement, she gripped the reins. The horse then started trotting. She was still excited, but she started to get a little scared. She had no idea how to keep from falling off except to hold on tight. Then the horse started galloping! It was galloping madly, too fast for the poor girl. Panicking, she tried to jump off the horse, but in her confusion, her foot got stuck in the stirrup, with no chance of her prying it free. She closed her eyes tightly as the horse zipped along, her head bouncing wildly about. She was bruised and bloody and couldn't take much more, but just before she completely blacked out...her quarter ran out.Ah, blonde jokes. Will the madness never cease?

Meanwhile, back at the forgotten reef remains Eao and Arkon, who is still doing his Joe impression ( 8O )"Alright, I'm sick of this" Eao says. "Why is everyone else at a party and we are just sitting here?" She looks at Arkon, who returns her stare ( 8O ) Eao looks around and watches Alastor bumping into sharks. "Ohh..."Back at Smorf's palace, Armagron gives a try at scaling the walls. Being the farthest one up the wall, he's the first one to reach a window, which he falls into. "What now?" He calls down. "I don't know," responds Lizza "Do whatever looks most useful." Armagron falls out the window, and lands flat on his back in the water. "I'm gonna be sore in the morning, arn't I?" He mumbles. "A brilliant three-point-landing." comments Artreus, who decided to check out the odd group again. Two ships then descend from the clouds, the first green, the second dark red. The green ship dives to just above the land, the turns and fires back at the red ship, which losses helm control and smashes itself into a pulp on the rocks. "Yeah, Take that you Ninka bastards!" Shouts Artreus, "You killed my mother!" he then realizes he's the wrong Artreus and looks around embarresed while the green ship vanishes.(How's that for an update.)

(beautiful, just beautiful.  I love it. Although I'm not quite sure how to continue from there. Oh well.

She quickly jumps to the rocks and munches on the remains of the ship, eyeing the rest of her group warily.  She growls deep in her throat and looks down at the smoldering rubble. She realises that she's eating material that is not meant to be eaten and she coughs and sputters, wiping her hand across her mouth.  8O  She turns and looks at the rest of the group and notices Phosis, old and drunk and clearly insane, who has not been acknowledged. She dives swiftly into the waves and glides through the water towards him. She emerges next to him and stares.  8O  Then she pokes him. Repeatedly. Poke. Poke. Poke. Poke. Poke. Poke. Poke....etc. etc. etc.

A man and a woman were going to get married, and they approached a priest they new and asked for him to wed them.The priest replied,"Well, I will under one condition; you must not have sex until you are officially married." The man and the woman agreed to these terms, and they made plans for their wedding that was coming in a few months.A couple weeks later, the man and the woman came back to the priest and said that they wished to speak with him. "There is something we must admit to you..." the man said.The priest looked at him. "Have you remained abstinant like I asked you?"The man and the woman looked at each other.The man replied,"I'm sorry. She was screwing in a lightbulb and she dropped it. She leaned over to pick it up and I was so overcome with lust that I couldn't help myself."The priest shook his head sadly. "I'm sorry, but I cannot permit you to be married by me in this church."The woman looked at him and said, "That's okay. We're not allowed in Home Depot anymore either."Mwaha. Heard that one from a friend.

Yes, we're all a bunch of happy people. Just post where ever you can and you'll blend in nicely. It worked for me.  I play StarCraft, but I don't think you've mentioned that you've played that before. We'll I used to play StarCraft, then I took a time out to build my own SCUMS map, its almost done, but I havn't felt like finishing it.My username is Delta-Jay, though I sometimes log on as ~{SMORF}~ or something to that effect.For more information on Smorf, check out various Off Topic forum topics.As for other games, I do play Alpha Centauri (Sid Mier's I'm assuming) but not on-line. My interest began to fade, but then I discovered how to completely edit the factions, making one for me and one for my brother (who looked suspiciously like Stukov) That began to fade. Then I discovered Alpha.txt, and am exploring the possibilities there. As for any better games, I keep trying, but SC seems to be the limits of my comp's capabilities.

Artreus decides to check out the wreck's remains while Armagron tries to climb the wall again. Feeling a slight sence of pity toward Phosis, who is currently feeling the wrath of Noriko, Tre pulls out a small piece of the outer hull, still red, but now glazed over from the heat created by the crash. He throws it out to sea and its glint in the sun catches Noriko's eye, who dives off pursuing her new sparkly. Artreus then finds the charred remains of the pilot, who Artreus pokes with his sword a couple of times. He then pulls a couple of daggers from the pilot's belt and begins to leave, after stabbing the pilot again. "I sence some lingering hostility between you two." comments Stenellya. "Not at all." replies Artreus, who then taps in a short command into the wreck's computer.Using the daggers, Artreus then begins to scale the wall of Smorf's palace, while the wrecked ship blows up.

I am by no means a computer genious like our Shadow, and I'm gonna agree with him about the trojan. Either somebody's got Sub7 and is controlling your computer, or you've just got a nasty-ass buggy.

OK, yes. I'll say I like it.I'm not good at critiquing, but I can pull out a few things that I took notice of. You use good description, and you give the dolphins a little dialect, fitting considering something as a dolphin would speak differently than a human, even using the same language.

Hey, whats your favorite Ecco2 level. (I say Ecco2, cause I liked that one better)What first comes to mind is Two Tides, but I don't know why. Actually, for me I think It'd be the Lost Orcas.

Noriko slips through the water for the sparkly-shiny-ness  and catches up with it. She takes it in her hands and brings it towards her face, her eyes wide in wonder. "Ooooooooo..." She says, her voice gurgling in the water.  She rubs the cool piece of the ship against her face, smiling.  She turns around just in time to watch all the Matrix-ie-ness on the shore. She giggles and swims back over to Phosis and takes his spectacles, putting them on. Then she walks back onto the beach and joins the rest of her group, who is watching Artreus scale the wall. She pouts when she sees that they have eaten all of her bagel. She turns to Stenellya and looks at her. Noriko smiles and pokes Stenellya. Poke. Poke. Poke.(this story is slowly going nowhere.  8O )

Hey, Smorf is at least twice as tall as a Smurf!  heh, smurfs are cool though. I once abondoned my sister to watch it. (Of course, my sister being just old enough to walk would put me at 4-5 years old at the time.)Because people at my school are wierd(including the teachers) we concluded that smurf were the only (true) communists. keeping in mind, true communism is very different than praticed communism, but we thought it was funny Papa smurf wore red cloths.8OI've got BW, but don't want to deal with it on line. Maybe I should have asked who played SC before declaring I was the only player.

Arkon needs to get used to the new fanfare. There are no links in Noriko's profile to her artwork. Same happened to me with the new poetry, but I'll whine about that later. On the side that says 'artists' if you click her name there, you can go to the thumbnails, but they arn't linked to anything. Judging by the thumbnails, you're pics look great Noriko. I see a lot of improvment in that first pic, and the other just looks cool. Including your new avatar, I've got to say you're doing a great job with your artwork, Noriko.

Arkon likes contributions. Phosis and I are in Earth Clan because of our fanfic (and I swore loyalty in my first post.) Nonfish made it to Earth Clan, though he's never here, because of discovering the true reason behind E.C.C.O. (I'm assuming) you'll notice that the more active people are members. Eao with her artwork. Tethys. I noticed that the first people I began to recognize also happened to be in EC. Try to get involved with the website outside the forum, and see what happens.

I liked Fin to Feather and Eagle's Bay, cuz it was fun flying around as a bird.  And I liked morphing to a shark in The Hungry Ones (that's what it was called, right?)  I also liked Tube of Medusa, as long as it takes more than ten seconds cuz sometimes I have no problem getting to the end and then it's boring.  And in that level you can't die.  I like all of levels in the "good future" because they look cool and I like playing around in the floating pools and I like the water tubes.  That reminds me of something.  In those floating pools, you can make it look like Ecco is swimming on top of the water.  Except I can't do it in the very first one, in the second part of Trellia's Bay when you first arrive in the future.  But in all those other levels, if you do it just right it looks like he's skating on top of the water.  But it's kinda hard to do.  You go to the surface and move up as far as possible before Ecco falls back down into the water, then when he starts to move back and forth like always whenever you sit for a while, he'll start go to the side and if you immediately hold down the directional pad in that direction to make him swim it will look like he's on top of the surface rather than underneath.

About the "it" thing.  First of all I didn't even see where Stenellya used "it" instead of "he".  And, in Spanish, there is a "he" and "she", so there are other languages besides English that have it.  Of course, in Spanish I believe both words can also mean "it".  I know that "el" can mean "the" or with an accent on the E  it means "he" or "it".  And I've heard my Spanish teacher use "ella" (she/her) in reference to a feminine object, so I'm sure that can also mean "it".  And when I say feminine, I mean the word...all nouns in Spanish and other Latin languages are either masculine or feminine.In any case, I can imagine anyone learning English would be confused about that, cuz, at least in Spanish, there really is no "it".  And I think that French and Italian and other Latin languages are probably the same way.  By learning Spanish, I also learned just how complicated English really is, and why people have so much trouble learning it.  You gotta cut people a little slack.Yeah...so...I just...wanted to make a point I guess.On the other hand, if you're never corrected you may never learn it right.

Hey Raptor, welcome back.I actually havent forgotten about you, im sorry your account got purged. it happened when we upgraded owr forum and required everyone to re-register.Heh it kinda sucks the group who came from the undercaves is getting smaller these days. you'll find some people you might remember like dolphingirl, trellia whitefin (callyfin), histronic, crestoe, and a few others i forgot but are still around.Anyways hope you stick around and you should stop by fanfare.arkonviox.com and fill out a profile. it be cool to have a contact for you.

Someday I'll patch up fanfare so its a little more fluid than it is now, unfortunatly I've been offsite for the last two weeks, and tomorow is going to be my first day back at my office.So as they say in the tech industry; fixed fanfare comming "real soon now" :D

White seperatism.One should not neglect that Mexico City is probably one of the most poluted places on the planet as far as developing countries go, and People's republic of China isn't far behind. This is not to say that the United States is perfect, but one must rember that enviromental policy is about riding the fine line between conservation and the need to consume materials. This is the point where myself and most 'enviromentalists' disagree.(Sources: United Nations Human Development Report, 1998; World Bank)

I fixed it noriko for everyone to see go here.httpfanartwork_norikoum by the way artreus theres nothing wrong with your poetry section from what i can see. on your profile page its suppose to be called fan library. when i made the upgrade i also upgraded more then that. i still have to do do fanfare by hand it isnt operated by a machine. i think dolphins idea was a machine. by the way dolphin i need to warn you enigma isnt complete. im gonna have to recode it pretty soon once i prepare the main page. but if you got an ace go for it.

I have a simple but angry way to make myself feel better.Ari your just pissing me off, if you can't say anything postive and have to critise me on my own site all the time i can shove my boot up your ass and show you the door.As for you tethys i'm already in a bad mood. If you can't make a good comment then take that mouth of yours and use it to suck the shit out of your ass cause eithier way whats gonna come out of your mouth is shit.i know im not a good writer but for some of you to tell me that is just playin rude. I'm sure some of you were just playing but the games end when i get serious. I don't care if you hate it, I just want to see if you like it. or maybe just want to talk about your ideas. I don't want your opinions, maybe nice suggestions but i warned you when i made this post i was gonna have grammar errors and possibly more.So to make it simple, don't make me have to put you to tears, your forgetting who i am.

Arkon booted our fics off his Pick list.    Oh well....least your poem is still up.hmm. Why so they are. Oh, well.

don't you know tethys that exorcisms involve evil and the devil? just like drinking...Of COURSE they involve evil and the devil!  The point of an exorcism is to get rid of that stuff!I am by no means a computer genious like our Shadow, and I'm gonna agree with him about the trojan. Either somebody's got Sub7 and is controlling your computer, or you've just got a nasty-ass buggy. Either way, go out and buy yourself a copy of Norton 2002. That's what I use and it is my compy's best friend. ^_^Have you not read my last post?  I figured it out and it wasn't a virus!  Just a cleaning program which I didn't realize that my mom had installed.I do agree we should get Norton 2002, but it's not up to me.  I can suggest it...but that's only if I think of it.

I've heard the one about the guy peeing in the refridgerator.I can only think of one joke, and, in fact, I'm not sure how well I can remember it.  But here goes:A man was driving down the street when he saw a chicken with three legs. He went to get a closer look and the chicken zoomed off.  The guy sped up to reach the chicken, and again it zoomed off as if he were standing still.  Well he didn't want to be beaten by any chicken, so he sped up until he caught up with it, and once more it zoomed off as if he were standing still.  So the guy kicked up his car's speed and followed the chicken and ended up at a barn.  He stopped by where the farmer was standing and said "Did you see that?  That was a three-legged chicken!"The farmer says "Yep, we raise 'em here."The guy says "You raise them?"The farmer says "Yeah, you know how people always want extra drumsticks, so we raise three-legged chickens."The man says "That's amazing!  How do they taste?"The farmer shrugs and says "Don't know.  Ain't never been able to catch one yet."Okay, so it's not the greatest joke.

Heh...it's the Nobel Peace Prize, Sten.  Just for future reference. ^_~I know it's late, but since I haven't looked at this in a while...about the hyenas, they're not related to cats or dogs.  They're just hyenas, the aardwolf is their only relative.  They have their own family like I said.  But it's possible they may share a common ancestor with cats and dogs, I don't really know...but cats, dogs, and bears all share a common ancestor and they're not considered related.Anyway....aliens--well two things come to mind right away.  Vortex and Yeerks.  We all know about the Vortex, and Yeerks are from the Animorphs series, an alien race of slug-like creatures that take over your brain.  And now I'm reminded of Andalites, also from Animorphs, the "heros" of the galaxy pretty much.Um...so, take your pick...

Well at least I tried to be as nice about it as possible.  What's the point of posting a story if you don't want an opinion on it?  I would have offered constructive criticism but I knew if I did that Arkon would be even madder than he already was because it would have meant pointing out everything about it that I didn't like.Like I said, the ideas are good, it has its good points.I dunno about anybody else here, but I don't like it when somebody tells me that my work is good when they really don't think it is.  If nobody ever tells me that they think my artwork sucks, then I won't have any reason to work to make it better.  Even if they don't offer constructive criticism and just say "that sucks" I still know that I have to figure out a way to make it better. But I also keep in mind I'm never going to be able to satisfy everyone.  In any case, if someone says they don't like my work, I don't care.  You shouldn't let stuff like that get to you.  If you don't like what somebody says, just ignore it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
tethys...everyone is different. just becuase you dont care when someone critisizes your work, doesnt mean other people are like that!and no...when you post a story you dont necesarily want critisizem on it. if he ASKED for comments on it, he would have said that. he prolly jsut wanted us to read what he had worked so hard on. i know, when i post my fan fics, i dont want people says "well....next time make sure you add a quote here and here...and spell better! i dont understand anything you wrote...your story really sucks"AND...furthermore...if you WERE going to post comments...it should be things such as "a very nice story! if you wanted to improve on it, maybe add more detail to the character description" or something like that. but dont just go out in the open saying "you arent very talented at writing!!"so next time...just keep all the nasty comments to yourself...unless you can put it in nicer words. =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tethys im fucking warning you right now, don't you tell me how to fucking react alright? Normally if its a section or something i want opinions even bad ones but i'll ask for them before hand. in this case i didn't want negative feedback i just wanted postive feedback or no feeback.so even though you may like people telling you how much you suck at soemthing doesnt mean i'm the same way. but if you like i can get on alot of things you 'suck' at but i won't cause argueing about it is a waste of my time. so don't try to get the last word. if you want to continue posting in this topic make sure it wont be anything that irrates me. in other words get your ass out of this topic now before i get pissed off more.oh and trellia thanks for backing me up. and a good old kudos to phosis.i know my story aint perfect, i warned everyone before hand i just wrote it up for fun. some people will like it some people will hate it it doesnt matter to me. I know my grammar sucks but i think at this point im tire dof hearing it from incompitents. if my site has such bad grammar or my stories or anything then quite simply...get lost! I thought people knew this isnt a democratic site i have one rule -my way or the highway-

<div id='container'>
My guess is just that... Ecco doesn't fly well with a lot of people. Half the time you get "What the hell, a game about a dolphin? What the fuck is this?"It's not the kind of game that gets headline popularity, y'know? Which is kinda too bad. But hey, at least that makes this place even better, because I know when I found an Ecco site (namely the Undercaves, at least at first) I was like "SHIT! YES! WHOO!".

'Course, that was the hardest level in Tides of Time, you ask me...

Hey, I'm curious! I was wondering, any of you who've played the Sega CD versions of the Ecco games, would you be able to tell me which levels the songs from the Songs of Time CD are from?

Knowing the average gamer,teenage boys,I wouldn't expect Dolphins to be TOO popular around them.In fact,I'm rather surprised that Ecco had the success it did.Not that the games were terrible in any way,but that people actually bought them.But then,how do Sonic and Mario sell well? Again,not that the're bad,but now-a-days,games seem to be less cutsey and more deadly.I know,I play a lot of Survival Horror.(Resident Evil,Silent Hill,Dino Crisis,Devil May Cry...)And yet I still love Sonic and Ecco.Strange isn't it?Hmmm,intresting thing to think about...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i knew about this for a long time. i even heard rumors which you might find interesting.I heard the Undercaves wasnt the first ecco the dolphin website although i don't belive it cause the undercaves was probably the best one i have ever seen even.Anyways long ago before the undercaves i heard of a community called "Stars of Ecco" which i heard but don't know if its true was bigger then my site (bullshit i think cause my sites the biggest ecco site since the undercaves) anyways this site came around when the ecco for genesis first appeared.Anyways sometimes i thought to myself how would i keep this site going if say appaloosa went out of business and ecco died? Simple...and this is why my site rocks, fanfiction and artwork will keep it alive along with the fan base. Plus i hope to one day do a fan game based on ecco the dolphin.Ecco used to be advertised back in the old days, but i was dissappointed when the dreamcast release and ps2 release didnt get much publicity.Heh i'll make you guys laugh, i always like to tell people i have my own dotcom but when they ask whats it about i say "er um....video game.." then they say what game? i say "um ecco the dolphin" they usualy laugh at me ;)

Vogons, the slug like aliens from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.but cats, dogs, and bears all share a common ancestor and they're not considered related. and that was on my Bio test earlier today.If you go back far enough, all mammals have a common ancestor, (Whales, bats, humans, and cats have the same structure in their forelimb, also from the Bio test) and I'm sure if you keep looking, all life has a common ancestor.

I never once saw any Ecco comercial. I would argue against the teenage boy thing (Guess who I am) but then again, I'm about the only person in my school who plays the game. I told a friend of mine about my fanfic. He asked if he could read it and I told him that I would tell him how to find it if he survived Arkonviox.com for half an hour, I'd let him. Let's just say he ain't reading it anytime soon. I have very few common interests with my friends, which is why I have no life. I too was overjoyed to find an Ecco site, all my other interests were on dead websites. Sonic used to be my idol, 'cause Genesis was new back then and it only existed in my friend's house, but I find little interest now. (Then again, I didn't get a DC)As of today, I've got enough saved up for a PS2, so Ecco will soon take on a new meaning for me.

Christ,I sure do say 'Hmmmmm' alot,don't I?  x Well,back on topic.Yea,Ecco seems to be...well,how do I put it? Not generally loved by the 'average gamer'. Sure,gaming enthusiates (Sp?) do,because we can all see Ecco's quality.Every Ecco game was certainly a sleeper hit.People were not lining up for their copy as they came out.We fans were,but not the average gamer.This all may sound as though I'm putting the game down,not true at all.BUT I really think that if Sega/Appaloosa wants to make another Ecco game,they need to make the game very fun,and market it to not only Dolphin-lovers,but action fans as well.True.Ecco does indeed have action,but that dosen't seem to be it's focus.Instead,they focus on beutiful environments and a uniqe and intrieging plot.Keep these elements,reduce the puzzles,and make the game have HUGE replay elements.Make the game increbily fun to play.I loved jumping and purforming tricks in DOTF.But relised there was only so much I could do.Well,this is turning into more of a sequel disscussion,so I'll stop there.But I only mentioned it because I think the 'average gamer',where profits for the gaming company lie,needs to start playing Ecco,if the series hopes to survive.Oh,and Delphi,nice to meet a fellow SH fan.  8)

I've seen that map, a few of my teachers had the same thing in the classroom.  That just shows all of the lights.Cerebro, I noticed your new avatar earlier but I only just now decided to comment on it.  What is it exactly?  It reminds me of a character from ZOIDS Chaotic Century, with the style and the marking on the face.  Actually it reminds me of Raven except the face marking is different.Can I just call you Brain from now on?  (but I probably won't)

::I think unique games are better, and that's one reason I like Ecco.  But, the fact that it's unique may have a big part in it's lack of popularity.  Altho I'm sure plenty of people won't agree with me when I say this, but most games these days are just like all others in the same genre.  There's very little uniqueness in the gaming industry any more.  And of course people tend to buy only what everyone else is buying.  That's just my observation.I never saw an Ecco ad on TV, altho I did see one for Ecco 1 and one for ToT in EGM, which I no longer subscribe to.  I know there were ads only because you guys have mentioned them.  But they must not have aired very much.  Of course Sega's had a lack of advertising for years.  But they had really good ones for the Genesis games.Well, in any case, as far as I'm concerned I wouldn't change Ecco for anything.  Even if the games are a bit too hard for me, even on Easy (being one who sucks at virtually every single game I ever play--except fighting games).And about this site, I know it will last even if Ecco does die out.  I've seen it happen once before.  There is a site called The Phantasy Star Pages, the best Phantasy Star site ever.  Of course I have no idea how long it's been around, but I know it's a long time.  It stuck on years after PSIV came out, which was supposed to be the last PS game and everyone beleived it was.  People were still sending in fan art and fics and submitting their memories.  Of course, then they went and came out with PSO, but I don't think anyone expected another PS game to come out, especially since it had been so many years, and PSIV really was supposed to be the last one.  And it may as well be, because PSO is nothing like the original games, and the only things that tie it together are hunters, numans (which they changed to newmans in PSO), some names of items and techniques, and a few monsters.Of course, that series was pretty popular, but not like other games such as the Final Fantasy series.Ahem, anyway, we're talking about Ecco here, so enough about that. Obviously Ecco was popular enough for them to make a sequal, a kids' game, and to release the original games on other systems, and also to make a third game so many years later.  That's good enough for me.

I saw one Ecco:DoTF tv commercial,game was rated high in a few magazines,and another reason Ecco games don't fly so well with people is because alot of people say "Those ecco the dolphin games are pretty, but they're too damn hard"As for sonic,i love the games.I have sonic,sonic&amp;tails,sonic 2(or is it 3?) on my gamegear. And about the thing with more voilence in games,just give ecco a torpedo launcher and other aquatic weapons and watch his fame rise. A great idea for an ecco voilence based game would be a deathmatch.Anyway i'm sure i've put most of you to sleep with my rambling...so i'll just go to bed now,night all.

Good discussion guys.Something still puzzles me,what IS Ecco's target audience? Teenage Girls such as myself? Or older and more mature Nature-loving gamers? There is no doubt that Ecco is targeted at Females,but Males DO buy and play these games,obviously. oops: So to sum it up,if Ecco wants to sell better,I would suggest more advertising,which for Videogames STILL dosen't happen enough,and just overall doing a better job in the next game.BUT Ecco surely has a great fan-base.As indicated right here,on this site.And the next game will sure be a success regardless.I'm pretty sure that the following these games have will keep it afloat for a long time.

Yup...it is his. That's cool you caught his name at the end of the animation there, Artreus! It was actually Ankou's face pic back when she was around. The actual face pic at the beginning of the animation was drawn by the one and only...Crestoe (he did a great job, huh)! Then, Mooky took it and created that wesome animated one...  http://arkonviox.com/phpBB2/images/avatars/25.gif) Say...speaking of your animated face pics...didn't you do one once for Callyfin (well, back when she went by Whitefin)...? Perhaps she's still got it?!...or here's hoping anyway.

I think Ecco targets more of an intellectual audience...which makes sense why it's not geard towards one sex over the other (or rather, why one sex is drawn to it more than the other). I think the audience has to also have an interest in sea life. That's my opinion anyway...and you should all agree with me by accepting the compliment I'm giving that I think you're intelligent...heheh... ;)Oh yeah, and about the popularity thing...I find myself right in the middle. Have you ever liked something a lot...and wished it were more popular...then when it became more popular...it changed the uniqueness about it...? I dunno, it's just, that's happened to me before, so sometimes I wish certain things don't get too popular...but then again, that means always less of the product. So, that's why I feel in the middle of that issue.

Hey ark...how do I get an @arkonviox.com Adress? I know some people, (including you of course) Who have them
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You do what you just did) Give him your name (Phosis becomes Phosis@Arkonviox...) and a password. The password is case sensitive, so if it starts with a capital, it needs a capital. Also you only log in with your name, not whole address. My email account was up for a good week or two before I figured out how to get in, and I bugged Arkon about it the whole time

I'll agree with that, but I'd at least like to actually know someone who's a fan. It was my brother who introduced me to that game so long ago, yet now... Let's just say he calls this place a cult.

Tomorow's my last day, actually. Just a Spanish test. Then I'm getting a PS2 and a TV to use it on. And on Monday, The communists are comming.'Army Dudes'- a cereal I made up for a project... wow, four years ago.

*acts like she understands what he said perfectly* Uh huh, that's spiffy. o________o.....Just kidding. :D Um, and yes, it would be illogical. But I did have words to use, even if I was saying that I didn't know what to say. So I said them. Even I don't understand what I just said. Dammit. I knew there was something wrong with that popcorn. And confusing people is very fun. I don't think anyone really knows what goes on inside my head, either. Even I don't know what goes on inside my mind sometimes. woah.

My grandmother died way back in '92, and It really didn't have an effect on my until quite recently. What hurt more was I really didn't care then, and I regret it now. I've gotten over it, it's hard to mourn for someone who died when you're 5. What's worse is watching every one else die. My employer is in his 90's When you're that old, think of how much the world has changed since 1912. Ironically, He drives an Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight, and complains about old women drivers. :?

I certaintly would suggest buying a PS2.I have one myself,and it's the best electronic device I own.Not only are the games fantastic (With more coming out.)but the price is going down.AND it can play DVDs.And I always wanted a DVD player.And this is coming from someone who used to only buy Sega consoles.The problem with some people is that they don't like to admit they like certain things.I,for example,collect Transformers toys.I watch the shows,and am simply a big fan.Sure,it's meant for children.But I don't deny I like something.But,some do.In fact,everyone does.They like something,but try to hide it.So someone who may like Ecco may not even bother to buy the games,as they are afraid of being caught.Kinda like me and sex toys.  8O Um,never mind....

Awwww...poor Artreus. You weren't kidding when you made the topic titled "Bad Luck", were you? *hands him another lolli* Well, I'm getting my PS2 sometime next week, but the t.v that I have is incredibly small. I'm just wondering how I'm going to play anything on it. I need a new t.v but I don't have very much money to squander away. Heh. But I guess that's not as bad as your situation, huh? Spoot.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Glad to hear it, Ari. Heh. And I was just kidding, anyways. I couldn't possibly care less if it bothered you or not.    *gets him in a headlock and noogies the shit out of him*

I'm sorry, I had to chuckle at that last sentence. 8O Well, the thing with my Grandpa was that when he died, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to feel. I hadn't seen him for...oh god, how long was it? Well, since I was 6, so I didn't really feel like I knew him.(that was like, alomst 10 years ago) But just seeing how much it hurt my dad (it was his dad), hurt me too.  But lately, I've just been remembering all the stuff he used to do with us when we were little and it's made me kind of sad that I never got to know him better before he died. He was the only really nice member of my dad's side of the family. Heh. Alright, enough about my problems.  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(LOFL!)Well, I'm not embarrassed to like Ecco. In fact, almost everyone I know or I have ever come into contact with knows that I like Ecco. Who cares if they think it's a children's game? Obviously it appeals to older audiences, right? And if they've never played it, then they don't know. (Same with me and Sailor Moon...some people are just so ignorant. Tsk tsk tsk.)

For those of you who follow it, and I do hope there are some, chapter 7, and hopefully 8 will be up tonight. I have decided it will end around chapter 20, and I will begin the sequel. If my plans go correctly, the entire Earth Sea saga will be a Quintology, but will not follow the characters completely. It will have them in the other stories, but they will not all be about Phosis's adventures. As well, I am working on a new story, but it is not really an actual STORY. It is called, Cralwers Swimmers Flyers, and is about the dolphins evolution, and how it relates to our own. If anyone is interested in any of my stories, post something here, I would like to know!

No i dont think so Eao....It is a little bit serious, a little bit not, but much if it is not entirely untrue. And Art, I know ya do. Thanks.

I hate sending characters off...that is one plot twist I hate adding to my stories..I do it anyways, to keep flow, but Ya know.

Boo Ps2...has like...3 good games. Consoles have really hit the shits lately. ps2 has the same amount of processing power as my commodore 64, and less colours then my gameboy. If I was going to get ANY console, it would have to be an Xbox. 800 mhz, and a 10 gigabyte harddrive. the only console that could ever possibly handle games like morrowind.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ugh, I can't look at my monitor too long. I get quesy... roll That 3rd TV doesn't need to be replaced to work the PS2, as I thought, so that's one less roadblock. :)

Well that's a bit of good news to help cope with the bad then, eh Artreus?! Here's hoping the whole monitor thing will work out sooner than later! That's cool you'll be getting a PS2 soon to play around with...they're quite fun, believe me! And, coming from both a PS2 and Xbox owner...as of right now I play the PS2 more! So believe me...there's quite a bit more than just 3 good games out there for the system...sorry Phosis, I have to strongly disagree! And, about the "ps2 has the same amount of processing power as my commodore 64" comment...well, I can't say for certain about that, but the "less colours then my gameboy" statement...heheheh...now that a far stretch from the truth! Oh well though, no harm in disliking a system just for the sake of doing so... :) ...anyway, all you soon-to-be owners of a PS2...have fun when ya get it!

I agree . . . but under current law I'm not actually *stealing* them unless:1) people mistake MY parody/satire for the original2) said mistake causes the original artist to loose businesscopyright law is more strict than that. to quote a site on copyright issuesgeneral art;"Unless there is a clear statement that art, photos and text are "public domain" and available for free use, the best policy is to assume that they are copyrighted and should not be taken and used for re-publication on a local area network, a wide area network or a Web site.""Internet pirates argue that work is not copyrighted unless there is a clear notice on the Web page or site. This simply is not the case. Copyright law protects work even if no papers have been filed with the government. ""If permission is granted, the best policy is to provide a credit line near the item or at the bottom of the page. "Student Art;"Student work is intellectual property and deserves protection against piracy as much as adult work."that means without artist permission you can't legaly use or alter another's art without their permission. the law you stated applies to commercial artwork, not private artwork. the laws for commercial and private artwork DO differ, and if those who's art had be stolen decide to gang together and find a lawyer there is grounds for legal actions and a law suit.also... law concerning graphics found on websites -"...if the graphics are original artistic works copyright subsists in them for the life of the author plus 70 years from the end of the calendar year in which their author dies."

<div id='container'>
Hi Ankou. Welcome back.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks for the unsolicited amateur legal advise, Katsue_Kamaitachi. Since you completely dropped my point about somethingawful.com and "fair use", I can safely assume you know pretty much NOTHING about copyright law.Basically, fair use states that copyright law doesn't apply when you are citing/quoting a work to make a commentary, parody, satire, or other critical work. This makes sense, too, otherwise it would be illegal to write a bad movie or book review because if the author didn't like your review he/she could use copyright laws to stop you (assuming you did so little as even summerize the plot in a half-sentance -- it would still be copyrighted).Fair use was greatly reinforced and extended by the Supreme Court when Roy Orbison sued 2LiveCrew over the new version of "Pretty Woman" that 2LiveCrew had made -- which sampled extensively from the original. The court ruled that since the 2LiveCrew song was so "transformative" of the original (changing "won't you walk my way" to "won't you suck my dick" as my favorite example of "transformative" lyrics in aciton) that even with lots of the "original" song in the new version, the new version was protected under fair use.Maybe, if in the middle of your self-righteous web-quoting coniption fit, you had bothered to read from more than one website about copyright law you would have garnered a clearer picture. I'm sure you will find some website and will misquote IT to try and argue with me; I don't care. I know I'm right; if you don't agree you're welcome to find a court willing to persuade me I'm wrong.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
he says its only illegal if"people mistake MY parody/satire for the original"yet he gives no credit to the original art... so technicaly he admits he's doing something illegal...No you idiot. Learn how to read English in complete sentances, instead of just quxioticly "refuting" me by taking me out of context.It's only illegal if I am PRESENTING the "new" artwork as from the original artist, and so the original artist can prove that they are losing business because people are coming to ME instead of them. You have to be a pretty fucking big idiot to think that these pictures are not altered from the original -- but I guess from reading you I can assume you ARE one.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
And another topic makes it to the O/T waste disposal zone.Usually I avoid expending care fuel on these things, but in this case I really have to say the furry community gets a big stick up its ass about copyright. Look folks, as long as you're doing furry art, you're not going to make money, get famous, or get any real outside recognition because the vast populace views you as a bunch of overweight socially inept homosexual men that dress up in poorly made costumes and hump children's toys while sponging off their parents until they're 30.Much like Jeffk and Cliff Yablonski, furie4jesus is amusing in the way it points out a certian section of the population out as complete losers.Its not as good as FurCentral's "Worst of the VCL", since none of those images actually needed to be edited; they're parodies in themselves.(Wow, rereading this, I sound like Arkon. Disturbing.)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
And another topic makes it to the O/T waste disposal zone. Sorry; I've been ignorantly berated by this issue by literally 100s of furries, so that whenever I come accross it again post-traumatic-stress syndrome kicks in and I switch to battle mode -- one of these days I should really take all my friends' advice and "just don't reply to the copyright whiners at all". I don't understand why so many people don't grasp that if (furie4jesus != real) {"stolen" artwork = criticized artwork}In fact another reason I strayed from the topic is because I thought it was tangentally relevant/OT -- furries ARE obsessed with copyright law, and not US copyright law, no. They all swear by some magical furry-land copyright law whereby if a big company makes something furries can reappropriate and cribb from it ad nauseum, but if someone clips some pixels out of their inept art and puts it into a satire picture that someone deserves hard jail time. I think for my next trick, I will have furie4jesus invent up "arguements" about how everone and the noonday sun is infringing on his "copyrites". Look for articles, pictures, prayers, and possibly speeches about "the treu natur of copyrite"!What do you all think? Comedy goldmine? Or gas chamber fodder before it began?

Baiting furries has been transformed from a simple occasional occurrence to a sport. You're nobody in the fandom until someone hates you. I think for my next trick, I will have furie4jesus invent up "arguements" about how everone and the noonday sun is infringing on his "copyrites". Look for articles, pictures, prayers, and possibly speeches about "the treu natur of copyrite"!Could be amusing. Go for it heh.

My dad used to be a milkman? Some other place my dad worked:It's his first day and the guy there is showing him what to do. He say "You spin this around" (I'm not sure what) "and take of these canisters" He then spins the thing around, then pulls off two large canisters and sets them on the ground. "You think you've got that?" He askes. "I don't know, let me see again." Says my dad. So the guy spins the thing around, pulls of two more canisters. "You think you've got it know?" He asks. "I'm not sure, can I see it again?" replies my dad. So this goes on a few times and finally the guy gives up. "Listen, how dumb are you?" My dad looks at him and says "I don't know, but I got you to do most of the work for me."

I have to say I preferred Beast Wars, but that may be due to the better graphics. I did originally like the original transformers, and my bother and I have the first comic. As of now however, Beast Wars isn't shown locally, but a Waspinator figure hangs from the light above my computer. :) As for Ecco, I wouldn't mind it gaining popularity, but yeah, Too much is... well... too much. There are fans out there... but I wouldn't be able to find any without the internet. Then again, WNY isn't exactly dolphin country either...

Asteritius - You lucky bastard.    The only G1 toys I have are a TwinTwist and a Pretender Cloudburst.Pretty sad,yes.BUT I have almost all the the recent toys.Later year (Transmetals) Beast Wars,all of the Beast Machines,and nigh all of Robots In Disguise. I also have the first Dreamwave G1 comic.Am still searching for the new releases.I wish I could find some flea markets and yard sales that have some Transformers.But no luck so far...Artreus- Yea,I like Beast Wars better too.It's off the air,unfortunatly.I could point you to a site that has a few for download,if you'd like.Not to mention there's a episode DVD out.

hee hee... they had a micro machines game for genesis. I remember this one level where you drive on kitchen counters and such, and my brother kept ramming me off the edge. Then one time I hit the brakes and he sailed right off. I liked the sound *eeeeeeeeeee* *pip* ? Download episodes? I doubt my 56k would last long doing that. but... I am planing on that PS2, so I'll keep an eye out for the DVD.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*GASP!* I 'member that game!!! Or was it another game...? Ah well, it was either that or some game for Super Nintendo, I'm not sure.  Heh. Anyways, I used to play with Micro machines all the time. My brother had like, every single one and we (me and my sister) used to take them when he wasn't home and play with them. o__o heh. The only problem was he always found out and got pissed. *shrug* Oh well. Nobody ever said life was a bed of roses. Or did they? ow. My brain hurts. x_o

*Is summoned across the cyber void by a little ding that says to him "you've got mail"*Lizza's still away, but I believe should be returning soon.Heh, spoot.Artreus makes it into a window and exams his find. "What's up there?" calls out Stenellya. "I can't tell, its a closet." Artreus calls back. "Do not jump out the window." said Armagron, apparently speaking out of experience. "Wait, I think I see something." the group hears from the window. After waiting several minutes Lizza calls back. "What did you find?" In response, a drawbridge lowers down to the group and Artreus walks out. "I come bearing gifts." He says. Then he hands Noriko a bowl of Macaroni and Cheese, whips out a sock, and hunts down Smorf for a good, healthy beating.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I like Ecco Jr. because its the first ROM I found that worked on my comp.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
(Yay! Someone else wrote! Thanks, Artreus  :D )"CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESE!!!! I mean...*ahem* Thank you very much." @_!. Noriko looks around, holding the bowl. She then eats a noodle, watching Artreus try to find Smorf. She takes the bowl and hides it in a little crevice in a rock, storing it for safe-keeping. "I'll save this for lay-tair." She whispers to herself. But first, she picks up a handful of cheesy-noodles and puts them on Lizza's back. She giggles and runs away, but trips on a stick and falls flat on her face. x_o ...She then realises that she's gonna have to try and continue this story by actually making some of her part make sense and have SOME relevence to the plot. o____o "OH NO!" She cries. "Where's Joe?" Everyone looks around, and remembers that Rien and Joe are still inside. Noriko runs up the drawbridge to find Joe.Spoot.  ^_-

I like it 'cuz ya can't get hurt and you can be an Orca.   :D  Now I have a complete collection of Ecco games for Genesis! *pats herself on the back* (?)Heh. &gt;_OSpoot.

Hey Nori I have a question...What the hell is X_0 supposed to mean? It appears as if someone had punched the little internet face in the eye or something...Is it supposed to be a wink? Cause I have never seen anyone wink and look like they had been smashed in the side of the head with a baseball bat before. Maybe try -_^ or something..no wait, dont. bah. Damn inerwebnet faces.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Nah, it's not a wink. It's a face that has just been poked in the eye. Lightly, mind you. Unless you put X_o. But otherwise, it's just a light poke in the eye. The sort of face you put when...you don't really know what other face to put. Hehe.  ... *cough* yeah. So now you know. ^_^

Hey ankou i still have the avatar mooky made for you. I thuoght you would never return so i put it on jader as a joke. I took it away the minute you came back from her.Anyways here it is if you want to use it.http://arkonviox.com/av/Ankou_MooKys_Avatar.gifBy the way welcome back, i never thought you'd return. I told you half the site wouldnt remember you. What happned long time ago was then. I was more confused then mad at you. You were a good friend of mine but in a way i understood. Glad your back, we need old schoolers around.

*is a pagan and god damn-well proud of it* Heh, but seriously - this dispute about copywrites is aweful *shakes her head* My only input - Its only truely best to alter the works of another artist/writer with they're permission. If your talking in the ways of using the original arts from big game companies - such as Capcom and Squaresoft, it is suggested that somethere on the page, you state the copywrites of the art, and even possibly post a link to the site that you got it from - and a link to the official site of that game, etc. In the world of copywrites - its a game, and if your not careful, you'll strike up the game over screen. Another example, take fanfiction, they have disclaimers at the top - showing and clearly stating what is thrirs, and what is not theirs. Ie. (taken from fanfiction.net)DisclaimerDisclaimer: I dont own CSI, the fellows at CBS do. I dont mean to offend anyones sensibilities. If I do, live with it, these are my opinions. I make no money off of this endeavor, I write it for the sole enjoyment of writing (and to please anyone who reviews)My oppinion and views are shown ^^;; take anything of this seriously and I shall smash my head into my desk and loose the page of my book.

<div id='container'>
Oh gawd, your a pagan too? *grins* Wow, I never knew until now ^^Oh, and nobody was putting paganism down, Eao made a comment on how the catholics had different views on women and such :) The one reason I became pagan was because - I couldn't stand how people could think about solely relying on one god alone, not to be offensive or anything - as I do respect other religions, but I only pledge my life and aligence to the way of the wicca. I also find it nice to know the names of the lords and ladies above *grins* Hehe ^^

Tre suddenly gets an idea in his head. (I call myself Tre instead of Artreus) He starts to scribble on the rocks with... something. "I've got it" He shouts. He goes back in time and stops Smorf for stealing Joe and Rein (and Lizza, for that matter) What his calculations failed to show him was the consequences. With Smorf prevented from stealing Joe and Rein, Artreus had no reason to go back in time to stop it. Without Artreus going back in time to stop Smorf, Smorf steals Joe and Rein. Because Joe and Rein are stolen, Artreus goes back in time to prevent Smorf from stealing Joe and Rein in a never ending cycle.*Head hurts*

heh theres probably more typos and spelling grammar errors in this site then anything. good thing the only people who givadamn are stupid anyways. heh but if its on the missing 404 page thats different, im sure people see that more then anything when ther etrying to hack into a page they shouldnt be or accessing another broken link made by yours truly ;)

heh but most of you idiots want to be in earth clan anyways.

Yer welcome Mooky... ;) ...it's good to have you back! How am I doing...?...well, hmm...as good as to be expected I suppose...heh. Anyway...so, Callyfin...do you remember Mooky doing a face pic for ya...?...do you still have it somewhere...?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have to admit Phosis...I haven't read any of it...but it's not because I started to and didn't like it or something. Those of me who really know me know I'm not a reader...I just can't get into it. Perhaps someday I'll do what's been suggested before...and print it out...cause reading it on the computer is a definite not-gonna-happen. So, I just want to let you know my non-participation with your posts and stories have absolutely nothing to do with your work!!! Keep writing though...I know there's lots of people out there who love to read those things... :)

C&amp;P, copy it and stick it into your address bar. Or click 'Save target as,' but I think in this case, it would be kinda weird. It's happened before, my bother set the jigglypuf costume pic as his background, which scares me.The sword's a good touch though I've got a pic of me in a BMW.  None of you are seeing it. (Not my car either, but that doesn't count)Don't have a place to put a pic anyway.

I've given in. I am now a proud owner of a PS2 after a $250+ shopping spree. The only thing I can play on it is FFVII and whatever CDs I can scrounge up. Someday I'll rent a DVD and test that out.The bad partx The good part: I managed to find it over the internet and I should get it around July 1. I can keep busy until then. (My job, my friend's paper route, several appointments for various things, and in my spare time writing (?)

man eao you need to lay off that gay ass gryph guilde. i don't mean to mean any offense here but drawing gryphs is a waste of time. They are unoriginal and boring.although i will give you some credict eao your gryphs are cool. just i seen alot of gryph artists and there art all looks the same....boring...As for furrie crap i like it but i don't think people should waste there times in those communities too much. My brother for instance is one of them who goes between those sites like crazy or used to. I just see alot of people there drawing boring crap. maybe once in a while i'll see a good artist pop up but it ends there. The only thing good about those sites they teach you how to become a little better at art but to get good you have to be talented and spend alot of time at it. listening to peopels advice on them sites is a waste since they just tell you flat out you suck and don't give you any real advice. real advice kiddies if you want to be a good artist don't ask opinions all the time just enjoy what your doing and spend alot of time at it. what other people think is a waste. i don't listen all the time what people say around here. if i did i wouldnt have a website and i'd be sitting by myself alone asking myself why i was banned from here or banned from there.So flaT OUT look for inspiration, work hard and you'll achieve your goals listen to other people and you'll find yourself in a deadend. people act like they know everything but when you actualy know the real facts your gonna find alot of people who are just talking out there ass.once again to be the best you have to ebat the best and you have to try to set new trends. good is a definition by people and whats good can later become bad.interesting topic....and funny yet you got the webmaster of furries for jesus here...i got a question where the fuck is those kick ass banners you used to have? they fucking rocked!

Miana your first generation you been here since this site was relly small and was on the ezboard forum. anyone who remembers my old ezboard forum is first generation.alastor your second you where here when the udnercaves was coming to an end and i wa susing the ultraboard forum.Phosis hate to say it but closed mouths dont get fed your 4th generation. but i doubt you been here in the first generation.by the way artreus this isnt the earth clan scheme this is the defender of the future scheme the earth clan theme was way before your time. i had it up last year. then i switched to the dark look i think its still there.my old sites still up guess the old server got fucked up.if you remember this scheme your second generation.http//www.arkonviox.com/main2.shtmland anything before that you where first generation. thats before i had enigma.heh can't wait for the 5th generation to happen. im almost there.

Try drawing that.and animals are eaiser to draw...in your community you'll let me say the truth about what noses look like to me.In my mind, the human nose is suppose to mimmic a penis...the lips are suppose to mimmic somthing else and as Vantid told us 'wemen boobs' (as you put it) mimmic a butt.look at a nose....the bridge connocts to the forhead in a large 'triangle' and nostrel holds 'flare' like balls.  show me an animal with a protruding cartilge...dogs and other animals have nose pads, monkeys have nostrels...elephants have an 'arm' nose.i said it, human noses look like icky weeniers and I feel emparased to draw them*bows*  so 'fury4' ya like my satire?

Awhile back, i had the "crazy" Idea to somehow make ecco human....well, I am bored, so I am putting more thought into it lately. I had the idea...what else would have happened when he opened the time machine? Certainly the streams of time would have gotten in even worse shape. So then I thought...how would being human fit in to the world of ecco since humans seemed dead or something? Well, the Atlanteans were human. (or so we are led to beleive.) So I thought, why not make a loop? In risk of contradicting ed, I thought, make something happen to ecco in the time stream...so when he came out, he ended up in atlantis before its destruction, in human form. Plus, it would leave him to have to deal with all the changes, (Lack of song...many extra appendeges...human emotion and so forth) But have him being the same ecco we all know and love; EG, a great warrior. The main goal would obviously be to use the time machine to get back home, and turn back to his original form...but there would also be many plot twists, and brand new enemies and such that you just couldn't substitute as dolphins. That way it wouldnt be COMPLETELY raping the whole ecco genre, (Like the old idea, which was converting the original storyline to not include dolphins at all; a fatal impossibility.) Of course, I will need feedback...I dont mean "BAD IDEA PHOSIS" Or sarcastic comments, or focusing on grammar....just some feedback on what I should add. Of course, negative comments are accepted with a limit...but nothing using swear words  :D   So tell me what you think, and give me your ideas, (Artreus, this means you of course) and maybe we can think up something really cool.

Hello again everyone. It is me, the consistent plague, Phosis. I was thinking...wouldnt it be cool if their was a site where you could post all of your made from scratch, original stories? Im sure there is tons...But I have not come across any! So i thought, why not make my own? I know lots of you here have stories you would like to post that are not ecco related, (Dont you??) and I am sure some of you write non-fanfics. That is what my site is for. Every fiction site I have seen is quite frankly, a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap (Think Ranma/Dragonball/Pokemon crossovers here people....or that old tv show, The Nanny. Or even, get this, homerotic harry potter fanfics. Yep, these people truly suck.) I think there needs to be more sites based on originality. I do not accept stories made for the purpose of sexual excitement, such as Lemons. Your story can have whatever the hell you want it to have, as long as its purpose is something a little deeper then a sex story. Violence is accepted. Swearing is, to some extent, such as if you were writing a gangster story or something (Like Pulp fiction...great movie) But you people get the general idea. Oh yeah, no stories in this form...really pisses me off;Phosis I dunnoWhat are you writing a play? and please...I know I do this, but I will be more careful....Try to look out for grammar and spelling mistakes. There has to be at least a small level of professionalism. It sounds restricting I know, but it shouldn't be...I am a very leniant guy. The site is, er, "Up", But I do need people to submit stuff before I can actually post anything. Like this site, you can submit chapter by chapter, and format is not a huge issue. RTF, DOC, WORD, any of the basic one's are fine...Anyways, I hope to see many of you there, submitting what you can. The website addy ishttp( Send any comments, questions, whatnot to that...and definitely your stories. Or, if you are too lazy, just post em under this topic. That will work as well! I hope to see many of you their, as I know lots of you are great writers. Happy Fictioning!  :D

i wodner if artreus got his email account to send out.It works fine through the site- meaning I can send and recieve messages, but as you told me, it doesn't do attachments. For a short time, I could do that through Outlook, but not anymore. Maybe I'll talk the guy who put it on the comp in the first place... I'm quite certain the problem is with Outlook, as it won't connect to other servers either. Oh well, I have my ways.

This idea I'll except better than the first. I've thought about working on an Atlantis fic, but never came up with any ideas. So I won't.One thing you'd want to consider, is weather or not the Atlanteans know whats going on. Do they view him as a crazy guy who's been with dolphins too long, or understand he's trapped in an Atlantean body? Or another possiblity is having him on the side, ignored by the general populace and his problem known only by few.What's interested me is how to depict the Atlantean society. It is excepted that they were advanced, but what else. The general idea is they're Greek, but is it an enlightend Athens, or conquering Sparta: democracy or dictatorship, diplomacy or war. They obviously are influenced by the surrounding sea, so they'd value it as a source of inspiration for art, maybe philosphy.I can see the new enemy thing quite clearly. Those who'd fear him, and try to destroy what appears to be a new threat. A recurring theme are those who want to capture and study him.I'm lossing my line of thought, so I'll rap it up for now.

I remember both, actually. The first I went to once, probably looking for the roms or codes are something. The second one I began to visit regularly, and was the first site for me to do so. I also remember when you switched it to the DoT theme, and I remember it was because the first looked like a 'shrine to yourself' So I've been around for awhile, but I'm in the same boat as Phosis, kept my mouth shut and never posted on the forum. I know my guestbook entry dates back to january, but that was the most interaction with the site. :?So I recognize some of the earlier generations people, just never interacted with them.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's just what I need! A dumping ground :D  I have a lot to write, nothing to actually submit, but you've heard me babble about Star Dagger, right?

Seriously,how is it?Your Ecco collection,that is. Do you own all the games? And if you do,what shape are they in? What versions do you own? And are there any intresting stories how you came about them?Mine-Ecco The Dolphin- American- Sega GenesisEcco The Dolphin  Defender Of The Future - Sega DreamcastAnd they are all in pristine condition,with boxes and instruction booklets.Whoo-hoo! Thanks E-bay!  8) Nothing else ECCO related,though.    And yes,I own both a Genesis (second version) and a Dreamcast.Lucky me,two dead systems.   But I'm still glad to have them.

I have (had) a wide varity of monitor colors. The one that died was red-tint (being seven years old, and probably the only part from the original comp) my my old one was blue, until it died and we got the green one. I've been lucky, actually. My computer I got for free (Ok, I had to kiss my mom's friend, but that wasn't so bad  ) and the green monitor was free. Of course, my comp ate a couple hundred dollars to become usable, and it crashed when we tried to install the internet on it 8O I have so many stories about the failures and oddities of my household.

Most are just deer hunters, but at least one has had military training.According to an unbiased opinion (some girl behind me in the Burger King take out line) I'm cute too.

  What is a "sticky topic" ?

<br />

<div id='container'>
Ok, My Ecco history.Began by renting both Ecco1 and 2 (I believe 2 first) by the suggestion of my brother. I guess something like Echo is not a typo, that's what I looked for)While looking for other roms, found a broken link to 'Ecco the dolphin'I revised my search and revived the hunt, pulling off Ecco 1, 2, and Jr.Overjoyed, I tried them on my computer, and Ecco didn't work.Crushed, I began playing with the settings.I asked myself why Sega hadn't done a Dreamcast Ecco, which seemed like a good idea.By accident, I played Ecco Jr. and it worked. I tried the other roms and Ecco2 worked too.Around now I find Arkonviox.com, and discover a Dreamcast version of Ecco had been released.A month or so passed, and I beat Ecco2 (and Jr.) I began to hunt for Ecco1 again. Took awhile, but I found it.Not until now that I realise Arkonviox had all the roms. I begin to visit regularly.Download a couple of MP3's for DotF and SoT CDAround last December Went with my aunt and brother for a day out. Purchase a PS2 for  brother buys various neccesites (FF7, mem. card) No stores visited had DotF.Last Monday  upgrade at Arkonviox causes website to run slow, I give up and visit Amazon.com and order DotF. ETA July 1st. I've never actually owned an Ecco game until now.Thus concludes my guest for Ecco, its been long and behind the times, but it's allowed me to enjoy Ecco in some way or another.

A sticky topic will have a special symbol instead of the normal post symbol. Any sticky topic will be on top of all normal topics in a forum, but under any anouncement topics. At the moment, Phosis' 'Rising Sun Fiction Depot' topic in the Off topic forum is a sticky topic. A sticky topic will stay a sticky topic until the original post is edited and the option is switched off.

If you want to, you can still do it. Some games have several guides, so having two similar games each with a guide would be fine.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah...just try to keep it original. And dont copy other peoples guides. Ive found most guides do that.
</div>

I had the old skool sega gen with ecco 1 and 2...I had a game gear with the Japanese versions of both ecco 1 and two...I have a dreamcast with DOTF. I have the ecco pocket arcade game. I am definitely going to buy the GBA ecco

well, my Ecco story is really weird and probably not that interesting, but WHAT THE HELL!!--Well, I first got into Ecco when I was like...I dunno 10? 'cuz my brother is really nice and he used to play it with me. We would take turns on each level and it was really fun! ^__^ (reminding me...I miss my brother! ._.) Well, about a year later he moved out (I haven't seen him much since then...) and I forgot about Ecco until one day he sent me his old Genesis in the mail along with some games as a birthday present. I was pretty happy and then I remembered that there was a really fun game about a dolphin (I've loved sea life for like...ever o__o) and I called him and asked him about it. He had completely forgotten about that, and he said he would look for it. A couple months later it came in the mail and I was all happy.  D-Ecco the Dolphin- Sega GenesisEcco II-The Tides of Time- Sega GenesisEcco Jr- Sega GenesisAnd within the next 2 months I will have Defender of the Future (for PS2)!! YAY! *ahem* anyways, that's my collection.  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I had an idea where the atlanteans were a part dolphin part human society. and ecco would talk to them humans cause they'd change themselves into dolphins.Heh your idea sounds okay but why not have Ecco use a metasphere to morph into a human.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

Well, my mom worked at a video store. So every week, I would get about 10 sega games that people had said were broken, and I would have to test them to see if they worked, and shit like that. The first two sega games I played were sonic 1 and toejam and earl....anyways, I was sick as a dog one weekend, and mom brought home Ecco The Dolphin. Me and my mom and dad played it for a week straight, and my cousin Blaine...He got to Atlantis I beleive, and then we had to take it back. So, When sega cd came out, (I got that system, and at a later time sonic 3, a week before they came out on market.) I immediately went and got ecco CD. Back then i didnt realize there was a difference between the two, except for the low quality movie at the beginning. I went and kicked the shit outta that game, beating it twice in a week. I had it for a good 3 months before my mom finally found out, and took it back. Then of course, came ecco TOT. RIght after Drama class, we went up to the videostore, since it was raining like hell...And there it was! My mom didnt work at a store now, so I only found out about it when I saw it on the shelf. I played it, and quite frankly, didnt like it. So, after the years went by I ignored ecco. I still loved it, but I didnt play the games. Then finally, two years ago, one of my buddies got both games and a sega, which were promptly "borrowed" from him, and have not since been returned! Also, I found two japanese sega game gear games in bargain bins across calgary....but they were crap, so I sold my game gear and got a game boy advance. Now, I patiently wait for the sega smash pack to arrive, so I can give my friend back his sega.

The bottom two run down the sides and stop and the base of the tail. They also do not meet.

<div id='container'>
Heh heh. Well thanks! I guess I don't like it because it's boring. I wanted my first one to be "good", you know, not a dumb little "inrto" episode. But I just... couldn't think of anything good!I'm actually almost done drawing the second one already. It's short n' sweet like the first one was SUPPOSED to be. Damn that first one! If I could go back in time and get rid of it... well, I would! o.o; Anyways... I've started making a little site for em' too. That should be up... when I have more "good" comics!

All I have right now are as follows Tides of Time - Sega GenesisEcco The Dolphin Defender of the Future - PlayStation2I hope to soon though, increase my collection. I've been looking into getting on an old GameGear along with the Ecco game...as well as getting a better copy of the old Genesis games I have (they're both in pretty crappy condition - but what can I expect for a dollar each). I'd like to find Ecco Jr. too...but, we'll see. Anyway...that's mine... :D

I used to own a mega drive with all avaliable Ecco's on it. But then I sold it and all the games I had. Now I am going to save up to get DoTF for the PS2 ) As they stocked a huge amount of Mega Drive and SNES games at the time. Why I love Ecco? I guess its just the feel of the game, your in control, and you have almost zero boundries - and a story that captures the heart of people )

I admit that I do not own Ecco Jr. But that's really only because I do not consider it a part of Ecco continunty. If I saw it REALLY cheap,maybe...As for how I got intrested in Ecco,well,it's not all that extrodianary.I was looking at the Genesis rentals of a Giant Eagle.Now,not many really appealed to me except the Sonic games,which I had already rented like,twice.Now,I was on my way out.And saw one with a Dolphin on it.I think I may have heard of it before,because 'Ecco the dolphin' rung a bell.But I haven't the slightest where.Anyway,I was intreuged. It was 'The Tides Of Time' but I was under the impression that this was the first,not second.So I took it home,but didn't win it.But I was still facinated.I forgot about it,up until Ecco for the Dreamcast came out,then rushed out to rent it.I won that one,and ended up going back and buying both of the previous games on Ebay.As well as going to a local store to buy a Genesis.And here I am.Or something....  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds nifty! I'd help out, but... I prefer to keep my originals to myself until I get 'em JUST the way I want 'em. Maybe you'll hear from me in the future, Phosis!

I've a special movement to save Ecco, to return in water when he's on the beach: I do a trick with his body in the direction of the water. Do you understand ? Ecco died a lot of time at the beggining of "Perils of the coral reefs", because I didn't know how to cure the wounds made by the poisonous medusas.

Sorry I didn't reply sooner Trellius! I didn't check this topic again...Um, yeah! You can get the MP3 at andnow.net, check under 'Virtual Ocean',  then 'In Progress'. Then, underneath all the movies they have listen, it says 'listen to a little more *music*' and you click on that! Good song, really nice.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
cally you are right...it does steal the heart of people. The story line is so original and so intriguing, but if it didnt have dolphins it would be very generic. Save the world from an alien. Whoopie, right? Until you actually play and beat both games. Then the story line gets much deeper, and has you constantly thinking, "Well what if.." Or "what happened when.." And it pretty much steals your life and makes you want to right an excessively long fanfiction or two or three or four about it. I love Ecco. I always will. Unless I become a senile old man who says he was in a bunch of made up wars. Then I will kill myself.

Just send in your work! Once you have three peices of submitted work, with one exclusive to the site, then you become a "rising sun author" Which means, you get your own section with profile and all. And stories can be any genre.

Yer welcome Trellia... ;) ...and...heh, thank you...  ...you're too kind though. Anyway, heheh, Doom...as you said that I realized I actually have a somewhat recent pic of me in a hockey jersy!

<div id='container'>
Instead of shoot down Stenellya's idea from the beginning...why not attempt to do it. Say...hmm...okay. I've got an idea Sten...why don't you come up with some suggestions of times (keeping in mind we're literally all over the world), and make a poll of it (now that you're Earth Clan...you can do that... ;))...maybe we'll get some response from at least half the people here...maybe...?!

I'd think it'd be interesting, actually. Whether or not I actually say something is a very different problem :?

I have been trying to beat this game for years!  Now I'm stuck at the stupid asterite.  How on earth do you speak to the thing?!  AHHH help me!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I had this problem before too. what happened is your game fucked up. you have two options. play the game up to that point all over again or use this password to fix your problem.OEWSURLC it will take you to the asterite and you should be able to talk to him and he'll talk right back. if that doesnt work trie this password. EILQOQLC.What happned was you encountered a bad gamg glitch that happens when you use a specifiv password. for example if you used the password 'AAAAAAAA' to get to the udnercaves and played the game up to the asterite you made the game think you already talked to him and the game fucks up. i can't explain it because its a complex bug but heh it's a bad bug. those passwords should fix your problem.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You're problem may not be simply talking to the asterite. Normally, you talk to the asterite the same way as anything else- with your sonar. However, in one of the prehistoric Ecco 1 levels, you must actually fight the asterite and steal one of its globes. This asterite hurts you, throwing lightning at you. Assuming this is the one you speak of, I'll direct you to this excert from one of Blackfin's guides.You now must fight the asterite it will fire lightning at you and you have to access to air, so you will have to be quick. You need to charge into a orb so it flashes, you then need to hit three other orbs of the same colour without hitting any orbs of another colour (if you do you have to start again). Once you do a timewarp will start (the end of the level). 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ahhh!  Thank you so much!  Maybe now I can finally beat the stupid thing!  I owe ya one.
</div>

<div id='container'>

<div id='container'>
Thanks!  :D  But just keep in mind that it might not be done for a while. I'm kinda busy with some other things...but I work on it every night. ^_^ So does anybody want to be doing anything specific in the pic? I know Phosis wants to be holding a pencil or anything else that indicates creativity.

Well, Whitefin is a scarry little thing... 0o; Shes actually about the size of Trellia, so she ain't that small *n. see tot - when you first meet here, and compare sizes there*. She has white reptilian skin that is tinted with mulberry in some parts, and is covered with black fur. Her dorsal fin is more of less similar to that of a whales, and has a spike pretruding from the back of it, so she ain't something you'd want to bite 0o; She has a crest on her head where her blowhole would be, and her tail is split into 3, with 2 long tendrils. Some of the best references I can give you arehttp//arkonviox.com/fanfare/fanartwork/stenellya_6.jpghttp//arkonviox.com/fanfare/fanartwork/callyfin_4.jpg &lt;--- better view of her tail.

Okay,I really need to play Sonic CD if I want to write my fanfic,and I downloaded an emulator.I'm searching for Sonic CD for a long time ! I'm a great Sonic's fan ! Do you have the game ? It's only for PC.If you need some infos about Sonic's characters (Sonic, Miles "Tails" Prower, Knuckles, Bunnie Rabbot...), you can ask me questions   
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks for the info,but I already have an emulator (Gens) but what I need is a sutible place to actually download the Sonic CD ROM.If anybody knows I would appreciate it. I downloaded Ecco JR. Neat little game,not as 'kiddie' as I thought it would be.  Actually,I HAVE Sonic CD.But I have Windows XP right now,and it won't work.But the emulator works fine....

<div id='container'>

I agree Phosis...I've always wondered since I've been here what it'd be like to get everyone here together! Of course, like you said, there's always the problem of everyone being pretty young...not having cars...but, I guess it'd be cool to hope for in the future...who knows. At any rate, I think it'd be awesome!

Time Zones...isn't it crazy just how many there are?! Here in the United States, we pretty much have 4 different ones (in the contiguous US that is). Over there in Europe, you guys have roughly only a couple...right? Anyway, I voted based on an approximation...but yeah, it'd make things different depending on which time zone here in America you were referring to...heheh...some things just can't be easy on ya, huh?! To clear things up Sten, ya may want to edit the poll and specify...say...Eastern or Pacific Time...those are the two usually used as a base time zone, then the rest of us convert it.Anyway, for those of you who would like a cool "Time Zone" map of the world (and have the Flash-Shockwave plugin and Java)...go to Time Ticker...it's cool, and calculates the different Time Zones pretty well. It also clears up some confusion of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) you may have. Anyway, so Sten...that's what he meant... :)

I live around Deer Run, and go to Grandin.Speaking of... do you know what that big fight was about between our schools the last week? I still haven't a clue. I thought it was about our grade 11's smashing the grade 12's grad, but then there was that shit about a drive by from some Beev student's. Huh... I dunno.

Long story, its about the current fic I'm writing. The vortex take over Atlantis, and in the final attempt to take it back, Whitefin gets killed. The people of her past all rise as spirits and enter her body - she then was revived, and turned into her second form - Angelfin. From there she took out the vortex, and banished them into the time stream. SHe used her powers to make Atlantis rise from the waters, and brought back the people that fled in the past, she then turned from her second form into her dolphin form - and her looks had changed due to her second form. From there onwards, even when she was in her human form, the people refered to her as the re-birth child. Rebirth Whitefin :)

Hey ´it´s not so easy:each hemisphere gets some adjustments at different times , you know , stational.

That was brought up when I first got into Earth Clan, and yes, it is merely a coincidence. I made up the name 'Artreus Hayson' a couple of years ago, and since then have seen many names that come close to it, and one that stikes it on the nose (See post True Artreus, lurking somewhere on this forum) I have considered making an evil Artreus, but I don't think that will happen, so yeah, the guy from Myst is evil

Heh the reason I wondered was, in the book myst, the form is written exactly like yours...Spaces between sentences and what not...and then stars seperating paras. It was awkward.

Well, I haven't visited the board in a while.  But I just want to mention one thing right now.  I want to remind everyone that I will be going on a trip to Alaska starting Tuesday the 2nd and will be back on the 10th.And if you're wondering why I haven't been around lately, well...to tell the truth I just didn't feel like it.  Since I discovered this website all I would ever do while online is post in the forum, I hardly did much else.  Well, I don't think I'll be leaving the board or anything, but I'll probably be posting a lot less from now on.  I have other things that I like to do after all.Well anyway, I'll be heading off on my trip soon and then I won't even be able to post anyway.

I just find it cool to find hockey chicks, because none of my girl friends are, ya see.I've found a new sport though... soccer. Now THAT is a real mans sport! Is in hockey they hit, in football they hit... but in hockey and football, you have tons of protection. NOW soccer! You got nothing! And they hit harder, faster, and with more leg muscle!I've also found by watching soccer... that soccer players have nice butts. Delphi! I want a soccer player for my birthday, you got it?!?!?!

Australia isn't the only place with half-hour time zones...Newfoundland and India have them as well. Anyway, I agree with Doom...I think it's a cool idea, and maybe rather than asking people...just set up a date and time...see what kind of turn-out it gets, then adjust the whole time thing for future ones... :) ...either people can make it, or they can't...and, I'm sure there's not a time when every single person here could make it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...yeah, have fun! Hopefully you're looking forward to it. I know what you mean though about disappearing from the forum for a while. Sometimes, ya just gotta do it. Have a fun and relaxing trip, and maybe we'll see ya when you get back... :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hahahahah...yeah, soccer is another cool sport. I used to be really really into it a while back, but for some reason...I dunno...I think my focus went from soccer to hockey. Anyway, I know what you mean Doom...not many of my female friends are into hockey as well. Except for my two older sisters. They've even played roller hockey (one of 'em is really good - goes to tournaments n'stuff). But yea, always nice to see a chick dig hockey... ;)

You're probably trying to hit a switch that is a light-purple in color. Those switches don't work. Only the switches that are red, will work. So, make sure that the one you've been hitting is red. If it's purple, what you'll need to do then, is back track to the next available side room with a red switch with the same symbol on it. From your post, it sounds like you're trying to open a single crusher...so just backtrack till you find the closest single switch that's red...then make a run for it...or, "swim" for it...hehe... ;)

Ah, yes, the shattered glyphs. I seem to remember thinking they were what the manual called "puzzle glyphs" - glyohs that needed all of their pieces back together to make them work. I'm not talking about the ones from the first real level of ToT, the one where you had to sing to the four glyphs and put them back into the big one. I'm talking actual broken glyphs (like those in question) that you needed to find pieces for and put back together. But I could never find the pieces! So I'm assuming that what Eao says is true, and they are just leftover sprites, unused in the final version.

Find an image of the CD on the net somewhere, it'll be packed as a BIN/CUE file or something like that. Use your favorite buring prog to write that to a CD, or just play the .BIN file directly in an emulator.Good luck finding it. So far I can only find the DC image of it, which is worthless for what you want to do.

wow i havent seen you in a long time. for a while people asked about you and i forgot who you were. i remember fully now, welcome back.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey kitnee havent seen you in a while why do you keep doing that   Yeah that was cool back then dolphingirl, i remember when me and crest made our come back we introduced enigma and had probably one hell of an awesome return. i wish i could do unpredictable changes like that again. but i love to give away the surprises. I rememebr back in the old forum how i keapt talking about enigma and people didnt belive it was gonna be any good or amount to anything and when i introduced it people were in such a 'wow' i had everything i ever wanted. i think that was the day the ball fell into my court.

<div id='container'>
i'm gonna be starting a glitches section pretty soon. it will be a good source for things like that.
</div>

i'll expalin it.you need an emulator and a rom image to play a game.WHat the emulator does is its a translator. your computer can't understand the same programming as a genesis or a super nintendo. so an emulator was created to be the translation tool.Now what a rom image is, its downloaded from the actual genesis game cartridge chip. so if you had an ecco game for genesis and wanted to play it on your computer you use a speicial tool to download it from your game into a file.you open that file (which was your ecco 2 game) with the emulator which translates it.sega cd games are different since there on a cd. you play them with an emu to translate them since they were in the sega cd language. you can get the cd or download the cd image (the stuff that was on the cd to make the game play)i probably wont have the ecco cd images on my site. the size of those things can be 30 to 100 megs. so if you have a 56 k modem like my poor pitiful self it will tAke 2 days to download it. -i dont it before- and it would take 2 days to put them on my site (upload)i hope that explains it. it took me a long time to udnerstand it too so dont worry hazard.

So what is it with north americans and this whole sex driven society anyways?Is there anyplace this day where we can discuss human sexuality openly, without succumbing to bravado or innuendo, or school yard giggling? I think a lot of people on this board are pretty smart and have good opinions, and (most) people here are pretty mature about things too.So what is your opinion on the subject?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh....Okay.I understand. 8O *Sigh* I looked everywhere,I can't find shit. Maybe I can dig through my memory and hopefully remember the game. :(  Thanks anyway guys. 8)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
...well I would'a put this in the topic "Hey Arkon..." but ya locked it on meh! I didn't get the chance to thank you for correcting my face pic problem. What was wrong with it, and how'd you fix it? Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I appreciated it... ;)Oh yeah...about the site thing...that's terrible it's down for as much as 4 hours sometimes...yikes! But, after fiddling around with my connection for a while...and having trouble with another site after leaving irc...I realized it could've been my connection as well...but, oh well...I was able to get back on the site after a while...so...I was cool by then...hehe!Anyway, thanks again Shadow! And, I would be interested to know what was wrong...if ya have timd to fill me in... :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Stenellya- Errr,thanks.I suppose.   Kitnee- Yes,you are correct. x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well why are you so interested in the first place? Sex isnt in JUST north america, its almost everywhere in modern society these days, and has been for quite some time now. Has it reached some kind of all time high or are you just noticing?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah DG, they just don't love us enough.  But still... $2000... damn!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It's sex. What exactly is there to talk about? Sex. Used to make babies. And for fun. And for some, Money.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm interested in the first place because I just think it's an interesting subject to discuss. For the reason that it is almost everywhere. Why not discuss something that is so much part of our lives, yet a lot of people are ashamed to speak of.Besides... it's not very often we have an intelligent conversation in here, so is this so much to ask? If it makes anyone uncomfortable, then just don't post.So Crest? What is your opinion?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Are you gettin' better and better or is it just me...?     
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That would be like discussing why we dont eat the first piece of bread in the bread bag....Hmmm....That would make a good topic. *Writes it down*What do you mean whats my opinion on it? I aint ashamed to talk about sex although some people are. Its not soemthing you really talk about. Such as having it, should be more kept between the to people participatign in it.As for our little sex driven society. Sex Sells, So you'll see it pretty much anywhere. Besides that, its openly discussed almost everywhere, except those uncomfortable to talk about it which usually has to do with religion n shit. But i dont really have much of an opinion on it considering it so much apart of our lives, just as long as it aint the top priority or anything. :PIf you want my opinion on it, its cool with me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i...love your avatar crestoe!! and about sex..well...sex is sex..leave it at that

Incomplete portion of the game or perhaps just one that doesn't have a message for your language type. If I recall theres a few things that only show up when playing under the japanese locale of the game.

Maybe they are in fact the same character, but spelled differently since there is no established spelling of "Artreus" :D.

Bah, Phosis, now you've made me feel bad for being nasty to Arkon You said that Ecco would get a human body and the human emotions that come with the body. This means that pretty much the simplest way to get Ecco into a human body would be to have an already existing body, whose brains Ecco's memories will be embedded into. This means you could have his relatives mistaking Ecco for the guy whose body he is in. You could have Ecco's body stashed away in some remote place/time/place beyond places and times, since having a time machine would facilitate that pretty easily. In a similar fashion, that human's memories could be spared with a little plot trick. This would give you the freedom to write about, for example:- a feeling of responsibility. Think of it; you end up by accident in the body of someone else and get to know that there is a way to return the mind of that someone back to the body. Someone so dedicated to preservation of life as Ecco would really ponder about his responsibility of a body that isn't his own.- maybe get Ecco and the guy whose body he is in to talk after they're both "where they should be". You could create a great amount of controversy by putting this in the ending and making the guy whose body Ecco was in angry...- of course, having the body of someone else, Ecco would be mistaken for that person by everybody...You'd just have to be quite careful with this idea, since it is not very original and might well lead to additional cliches which plague this kind of stories.

Since I hadn't even heard of that book before reading this thread, I can't really say anything...

Most people think that Finnish is a cute language ;). But no, "Finna" doesn't mean anything in Finnish. "F" is actually a rather rare sound and not found in native Finnish words. My mother's name is Minna, though. (and note that Finnish is phonetic, so there is a very clear difference between the pronounciations of "minä" and "Minna")

Sex is the most natural thing we do.And I do agree that it should'nt be looked opon as 'dirty' or disgusting in any way.Unfortunatly,the Government and church groups can't understand this.The Human body is a beutiful thing.It annoyed me to no end when Donald Rumsfield covered up the statue of Justice because her bare breasts were showing.Perhaps if children wern't shielded from this stuff,we could be more open to it as adults.Because when you really get down too it,whats so  freaking offensive about it?  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hmm...No. I dont like that idea very much...it seems like a tale of possesion...And If I added that element, that would be mostly what it would concern...No, something like Arkon's idea would work better. It would also be about Ecco trying to stop the destruction of Atlantis...and well, other things I do not want to mention. Point is, I dont want it to be based around ecco trying to return a body.

Thank you Raptor! That was a good and intelligent opinion.Why are children raised afraid of themselves? "Oh geez... don't say penis son, it's a bad word!" There's nothing wrong with the human body, but a lot of people act like there is.You have to have more to say then just "sex is sex". And don't worry Sten, I don't mean let's talk about our sex lives, just sexuality in general.

I think the society gave a bad image of sex, a dirty one; because we always see at TV porn films and fictions about prostitution.But it isn't the reality: sex is a way to give love and pleasure to someone we love (girlfriend/boyfriend, wife/husband) and to have babies.There is an important emotional part, on the contrary of the animals.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
no one loves me because I'm ill and not good breeding fodder.you only get sex and love for being and having what people want, but us sleezy american are too oversexed, a teacher of mine was talking about how he overheard some 12/11 yr olds talking about (I forgot the word they used) but these are non intamante pals who, if your hormoans are raging and you don't know what to do, you call them up and sooth the primal screaming in your groin by humping them.  Not to mention you are a no body if you didn't start having sex at 13/14.  But people are shallow, and those attracted to disesed people I belive have a sick fettish (survival of the speciese dosn't care about nice or love, the best genes are only to be pasted, egg donation places only accept healthy, talented, smart, pretty woman's eggs)http://www.geocities.com/pinksrealm/love.htmlthis person has some odd ideas, her first lesbian experance was when she was 4, and it was with an 8 yr old.

But it stil makes me feel so sad at weddings - my mom never got a chance to dance with her dad at her wedding because he died before it, and every time at a wedding when the bride goes to dance with her father, my mom has to leave the room.   Very sad..

Stenwink:  Nah, I'm kidding - you can play after me. ^_^*grin* OK, my turn...hrm...hasetomcthThis is an Ecco level...but one only available in the Japanese version of the game. *hint hint*

Yuck... zoophillya. Fucking wrong, man. Like, when did stuff like that come about? If sex was only ever meant to make children and share love, then why is it human nature to sometimes become a slave to our body? I mean, how did it turn into something so different? I think our sex drive is too strong for our own good. O_o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm,zoophillya. Well,whatever you do inside your bedroom is your own bussiness,really.  :? Not like I can tell people NOT to do that,it's not going to change anything.And if someone happens to get off on that,then that too,is the're own bussiness as well.The Human Sex drive happens to be one of the strongest in the Animal kingdom.It's more then just reproduction,it's also part of our society.Primates are like that.

Again another cancelation of a project *sighs* Gah, sorry if I sound like this is stupid - I'm just not in the happiest mood at the moment.  However, I do hope that this plan actuall goes well.Hey Dophin, I shall be sending you an e-mail soon with my own ideas on what I wish to do with callyfin.dolphinparadise.net, m'kay :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
this is gonna be 1000 times better then enigma. btw thanks dolphin
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it had to do with crestoe not being around as much and the fact dolphin and i decided no more mods were needed.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Eee, thank you alot guys *clings* Well, I may colour it one day - but I am unsure of weather I will or not. If I did, I would have to digitally paint it, and that hurts like hell. THe last digital painting/colouring I did with my tablet was that paintwork on the Talyn pic for Delphi, however, we'll see... we'll see..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
k o.o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, it's too bad you had to scrap the enigma project...I mean...you worked tons on it?! But, I guess if this new thing is like what you say it'll be...oh well, huh... ;) ...good luck with the new project Arkon!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm...interesting. Well, all I remember happening when I tried to reupload it was the pic would be the typical tiny white box with a red "X" in the center. When looking at it's properties, it had an arkonviox.com url attached to the front of the pic's url...which by the way isn't located on this site...so, that's when I realized somethin was definitely wrong. Anyway...I'm just glad it works now... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Awesome Kitnee... :D ... *hugs back*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

Let me clairify; Where did you get that information? It hasn't been published in any of the reputable news sources that I get (such as the Union-Tribune, a sandiego newspaper, or sea world's own newsletter, which I recive as a pass-holder)If you got this information from Stefan Jacobs (of orcahome.de) be aware that Stefan had admitted that he does not have an offical statement, but it "sure seems that way". That's called hearsay.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol - Oliver Wood was hot.You know the guy that played Oliver Wood? His cousin is in grade 7 at my school ^_^ and it shows x.x she has the accent as well :D

<div id='container'>
Usually,when I draw a picture,I write a poem or short story to go with it in my dolphin diary. But ny poems are not that good, and my stories are only about two paragraphs long.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Dang it! :x  why do I keep coming up as a guest!? (Lizza) I made that last post.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I dunno, it doesn't seem all that bad. It'll take a bit of getting used to, but I like it.  Yeah, it is too bad about Enigma, especially after all the work...maybe you can revive it someday, Ark?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Don't forget me! I'm just a bottlenose dolphin with a glowing stone on her forehead. (Lizza) I've benn coming up as a guest,so it's me...Lizza!

<div id='container'>
Just the opposite for me. Just began an RPG (FF7) and then DotF arrived in the mail  But... with school out I find myself working more :? Oh well, money for a new comp I suppose...It is fun seeing everyone coming back, I will leave for the Adirondaks sometime this summer, so I can get some writing done and come back strong.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm,I got to ride horses and go to seattle. We went to this Roaring Springs water park in Boise and met this really cute guy! Heh heh! I bought lots of clothes and a new dolphin plushie. My sis and I saw thus sign next to a hotel that had a dog takin' a poop,and said "designated areas behind hotel"   I made up this new furry char,but,no name for her. It was 108 degrees at 9)  I really had a better "Thyme" than I thought. (I couldn't resist the pun) what happened when I was gone?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Now that's what I need - a job! LOL I need money, dang it! But I should be getting loads of cards with money in them right about now...have to check the mail today! ;P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Absolutly nothing. That's almost a joke. As you can see now, mostly just people returning from... where ever they were at.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow! Sounds like you were busy, and having fun at the sametime! :P Nothing much happened around here, as always. &gt;P

Just a vocabulary question: is the qualifier "beloved" just for the boyfriend/girlfriend, etc. or also for the friends and the family ?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm,except there were about 126 new topics that I had to look at
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have several ideas for pictures, just not the skill to put them on paper. As for my poetry... I guess it's ok, but I don't make a habit of it. When I have an idea, I write it down, and sometimes I force in a rhyme scheme.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think that's what happened Kitnee,because it works now!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ya...what happened to yer face pic?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have to update thisI just got DotF for PS2 in the mail this monday (wow, that was yesterday) I died in the first level  got wedged between some rocks and drown, how embarasing. It wasn't until after that I figured out how to swim backwards. :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i was suppose to start the avatr request program soon but the reaosn why i never got it finished was this site will be getting an upgrade pretty soon.

Who needs money when you can mooch?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
since there is no established spelling of "Artreus"  The one with no established spelling of name" I set that up because everyone seemed to spell it differently, and it was a knock off of 'no established style of hair' Seems to me I should change it again. It has a good start but 'unknown effects' seems weak.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, I actually have no clue what you all are talking about (what else is new?)... but I'm sure it's going to be great!!!Any news on when this will all be up and running?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
In my mind, there's too much in advertising/TV/whatever. I'm not saying it doesn't belong there, but when its used so people ignore whatever is advirtised is crap, that's overdoing it. But, as said, it sells. I also hate it in movies when two people hate each other, then they're in bed together in the next scene.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^________^ Thanks guys! I'm glad you actually like em'! I didn't think anyone would. And I'm glad you like the style to DG! It's something new to play with for me.And Cally... are you kidding me?! His cuz really goes to your school? That's cool! I'd be trying to hook up with her cousin if I were you! ^_- Ha ha! I just love your guy's accents over there!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think its just simlply "loved by" or "something that is loved." It comes to mind as a little strong for family, but I don't see why it can't be used in that way.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ha ha! No kidding... that pisses me off too. And it's usually the chick who does that. Guys have a bad rep for that whole "fuck me, dump me" kind of thing... but I think a lot of chicks do it just as much. It's just that... guys are better at not getting emotionally attached after one night.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
friday or saturday if i dont go anywhere. it will work on the main page then the whole site.belive it or not post nuke can do what enigma could but better. when its done it will be alot stronger. it can customzie the look of the site and you name it.

No dread....Atrus was a scientist. he lived with his grandmother, and was abandoned by his father when born. (His mother was killed by his birth) Then his father returned years later, and took him to study the ancient world of D'ni. Then his father showed him the writing skills of the d'ni; write a book, and it literally makes a world, called an age. Atrus worked on these with his father, before relasing his father was insane and deceitful. Then he stranded himself in a seperate age, and met a woman, and him and her toppled Ghen (His father) and escaped, making an age of their own to live in called Myst. That is where the book ends, and the game begins. Phew!

Haven't said a word about this game in the longest time! But I was at Doomtrain's on the weekend, where I happen to stash all my old Sega games, and I was playing Tides of Time. Now, I was playing the Vortex Future levels (Black Clouds, Gravitorbox, the other half of Lunar Bay) and I was wondering, you know that little... kinda circle thing in the corner of the screen, with the little ball that sorta bounces around in it? I don't know how to explain it, hopefully you know what I'm talking about ;) What's the purpose of that thing? All it does is sit there for no reason and the little ball in the middle of it bobs around when you happen to hit a spot with no gravity. Is that what it's supposed to do, let you know when there's no gravity?And I think I've asked something like this before, but has anyone noticed in the level 'The Hungry Ones', when you get to the deeper parts of it, and you morph out of a shark back to a dolphin, that your air meter starts to go down instantly? You drown in like two seconds! What the hell is up with that? It happens in 'Vents of Medusa' too. I was thinking maybe it was just to force you to see you HAD to be a shark through the level?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've really got to stop checking up on this topic so often...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have no idea about the ball thingy, but I think you're right about the air. I've only noticed it in vents of medusa, and you lose your air in a bubble patch near the key glyph. If you stay a dolphin in that level, It defeats the purpose.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Well, the memory card had an error on it, so I lost my progress (level 2) and started a new game. So much easier now, at present I'm in four ways of mystery, but I've been to busy to play yet today.

If your reading the title of this post you arent seeing things. PsySonic of http//ecco2beta.2ya.com/that site is ran by a cool guy named epicenter. both psy and i joined his community and got into a fight and probably both tried to convince epicetner that he needs to get rid of one of us. but epicenter didnt want to see anyone go and wanted to work out this dispute. PsySonic relized as well as i did that we arent getting no where with these fights and we should trie to work on an ecco community that can get along and perhalps someday work together.I learned from my mistakes and i think this community will benefit if we link together with caverns of hope, like they linked with us. My plan is if theres any sort of dispute between caverns of hope or arkonviox.com we will work to sort them out. caverns of hope sa good site. i made some new friends there who also want to see tour sites work alongside nameley silverfin whos been a good influence with me. If theres a good way to explain it, this qoute will be it."The stone that splitas the stream into two."I been that stone long enough, the ecco community doesnt have to be split apart anymore! So heres a cheers to a peaceful future!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
:D ...that's great news Arkon! Really it is...and I'm proud of the way you've handled things to straighten the whole mess out. I hope nothing but good things come out of this! I've always hoped your sites wouldn't fight...and I knew when you came to your senses...it was Psy I was worried about. So, I'm glad he finally gave in to resolving things! Anyway...congrats...big accomplishment in my opinion... ;)

<div id='container'>
Oh no...heheh...I believe you! I just thought it'd be a funny picture to have...  ...anyway...no camera?!? Well did any of your family have one to take pictures of the horses ya rode...or of anything? Hopefully ya got a few at least to capture the memory of the trip... :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well be okay dolphingirl, im friends with silverfin and psysonic and i are in contact.I don't want to fight anymore because if this started up again it will be impossible to fix. I'm also getting tired of contacting anyone who goes to that site with an evil eye. your all freely able to do as you wish.

The little ball is the gravity indicator. It shows which way you're going to go in stages like Gravitor box, where you have to do various acrobatics to get through.The metasphere is there for a reason.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it might of been a glitch. ecco one and two for genesis werent complete to be honest with you. thats why you run into things that seem wierd. alot of times they have to rush thing sout of developement and dont get a chance to make the finishing touches. the story and game is done but not everything is put in it. like ecco one for genesis was suppose to have dolphin predesssors but they didnt have time to put them in. and you will find glyphs that dont work. storie elements that didnt make it in and so on. in the gamegear ecco one you actualy bring the glyph to the asterite by pushing it down to him with your sonar. in the genesis they did this wierd stupid thnig that didnt relly make sense where the globe goes into ecco. i didnt get it eithier.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah...yep, having errors on your memory card can sure mess things up! So...Four Ways of Mystery eh?! Use that Sonar Map as much as you can...it's easy to get turned around in that level! Heheh...that's the level with that huge eel that comes from the ceiling huh! I can't tell you how many times I didn't think I was near it...and all the sudden... *CHOMP*...scared the be-jeebies outa me!?!

I was just wondering. I was thinking if it was a gravity indicator there wasn't much point in putting it in, because you can fluke it through those levels; I don't even look at that thing.

Whoo! Old emotes!  They sure were fun, especially the exploding head - I had nearly forgot about that one! XD

I got stuck on the damn eel level.  8O The stupid thing just kept eating me! So I thought about bringing up a sonar map so I could at least see where I was going, but it still didn't help! LOL So I just downloaded a saved game with all levels open/gifts gotten/Vitalits collected.

Sorry I left this so long...Steve?! You can HAVE Steve. *HACK* Stupid retarded kid. You notice all the problems that come in the game come from him? He's such an idiot!

I don't think I can download games on the PS2 can I?I am stuck now on the Anguish of Dearth/entrapment level. i just keep going back and forth between the 2 levels and cant seem to get out. I am going to try starting them over and see if i cant complete them correctly.

I just hate it how people can talk so badly about peoples preforences - such as people whom find themselves bisexual/lesbians/homosexuals.

httpD ...was always so much fun! She told me this year they've hired someone to do some sort of a lasar show...which everyone seems to have heard it's going to be quite extravagant. But, with Colorado burning up so much...and being so dry...I don't blame them putting the ban on fireworks. I would imagine if any other state would be doing it...it'd be Arizona...they've got bad fires burning there as well. Anyway though...I do hope everyone has a splendid 4th of July!!!

This topic is like some religion class family life session. Face it people like sex. Its everywhere, it always will be. Anyway to pleasure yourself is considered "ok" and not wrong. What are you gonna do outlaw sex? There are weird people in this world and there always will be, they invent ways to abuse "gifts" we are given with our bodies. And doomtrain what are you talking about? Since when do you find it not shameful to discuss sex? I know your opinion on all the sex shows and it's not one of acceptance. you talk about raising kids to know about their bodies but when someone mentions watching a show your like "oh no you shouldn't be watching that". and for all the less mature when i say sex shows i don't mean porn or explict programs i mean educational ones meant to teach.

We had all these fireworks and almost started our yard on fire.  and did anyone know that Casper is the only city in the US that you cannot buy,sell,or set off fireworks? At least I think so...that sucks even though we didn't get caught......heh heh heh heh.... 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
We had all these fireworks one time and almost set our backyard on fire (luck we have our swimming pool) and did anyone notice that Casper Wy is the only city in the US that you cannot buy,sell,or set off fireworks unless your one of the poeple by state law that can. It sucks but a lot of people do it anyway....and we didn't get caught..

Haha, well at least im the only one who got Tass's joke, but that's probably because me and him are practically the same thng anyway.  And that wasn't an insult, promise.Well here's something outta an acid induced dream..... arkon and psy are sleeping with each other now haha... well seriously i'm, not going to put much trust in this, i'll tell you true this is probably going to end with psysonic getting exploited somehow, all arkon plans come back to arkon in the end.  And i'm not complaining.  Peace with crysonic? I gotsta say fuck it!  This is a fact and, thats every good thing on this site has come from being in some fued or another, though with postnuke arkon probably thinks that he'll turn around and whup psy's ass any day, though i'm sure it wont make a difference.  I'd like arkonviox.com just as much as if it were programmed in html only, who the fuck needs to put skins on a website?  Well at least I can claim some sort of neutrality here, i'm trying to become an ecco writer right now and write for arkonviox.com and ecco2beta, maybe yours truly will stop being such a hard ass and wirte for caverns of hope as well.  Maybe, but i'm just saying arkon wasn't visited by the ghosts of website past present and future, and then decided to have a change of heart.  All I'm saying is arkon isn't completely castrated yet, and the are probably some alterior motives hidden in here.

oh come on Cally, these people act so full of pride and get so mean at others and scream and bitch and whine at people who "shoot them down'the grunt and squeal how great it is that they love the same gender.then they turn around and 'go nautral'Oh I'm so glad to love girls, but I'm sleeping with man and love it so much I love dicks!"but a year ago the'd be wretching at the thought of male lovers and act so egotistic with there acts.if you say you are gay don't twart it and act dumb....it's further ruin the rep you build.it's like the vegan who'll wear leather and fur and eat animals alive and cheese and buy prodcuts tested on animals.

What chu' talking about Jader? I never said anything is wrong with sex. When did I say to someone "oh no you shouldn't be watching that"? And most of those sex shows on TV... aren't really educational. But even the ones that are, they still put them on late to aviod younger veiwers seeing them. Maybe if we didn't raise little girls to be scared of dicks, they wouldn't be. Well... It's not really the media that does that, it's more the rapists.I'm not saying let's go flashing dicks on TV all the time, or just show it off anywhere, I just mean that a lot of people now are taught (basically) to be ashamed of their bodies. From the media too, with all this perfect image crap.And persoanlly, I don't have a problem at all with gay people. The thing is, I find they (like most to be concidered not the "norm") they bitch to much. Not that they shouldn't, they do get treated unfair. But then they get this channel, "Pride" TV or whatever, and that's basically gay porn 24/7. They want to fit in, but then the get their own TV channel, which I think is putting themselves in a class of their own. I mean, they prolly have that channel because most of it is porn, but that stuff is what should be suck in a class of it's own.

heh i don't have any motives the reaosn i went with the plan is were both websites its the people who decide but if caverns of hope is not a closed community that means you guys will have two sites to visit each day and we have more room for a bigger ecco community.BTW one day hist im gonna get you can crestoe and use that KY jelly to shoove two nice shinny boots up both of your asses!Atreus i seen you been a member under my nose all this time on that site. you can be yourself there, im cool if everyone decides to become a member there just make sure to visit here, otherwise there iwll be packages with little bombs in them waiting on each of your front doors.my opinion im seeing alot of happy people from boths sites who dont have tension on them. people are happy now and i think thats more important. Even if you people didnt visit im sure id be playing around with this site still.

Then, I must admit I don't understand the homosexuals and bisexuals.I'm sometimes afraid of them...Sometimes angry too, 'cause in France, there are a lot of gays and lesbians who consider themselves better than the straight persons, and are favored with regard to us (the straight) in their work just because they're in love with members of the same gender.The only bisexual person I know is Callyfin, and I try to accept the idea that she love girls too. It's hard for me, but I think she was nice before, and it would be stupid to be agressive with her just for her sexuality. I like her, so I must accept it and respect her all the same.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
No kidding doom...its like they are being arrogant...Yeah, I think most of the gays/lesbians are too arrogant (I said "most of", not all) ! The french State gave them the illusion to be superior by  favoring them in their work, giving them rights about the dismissal that the straight people haven't, etc. So they believe they are the better, just because they're married with someone of the same gender ! It's something I can't bear ! I also saw a gay who said that the straight are mistakes of the nature, and the persons of the same gender are made to be together !!!! I was so angry that I've wanted to break my television !!!!!!  evil:

I've checked this forum a few times and didn't notice this thread until it somehow got into my conscious mind by accident. The title itself was so unbelievable that the question mark in its end almost makes me happy...Now, about the actual content... hmm... I'll have to check the CoH board (haven't been there lately because of a strange trouble situation with Lynx and invalid cookie paths) and report my opinion back. At the moment I agree partly with Histronic but am much more hopeful that something good will come out of this...

Hm. PsySonic has played an RPG? No more Internet for me today, I've been surprised out of bmy skin twice already...

I've been there for a week or two, mainly to try the new persona. The rivalry dosn't need to end. The purpose of each site is to be the best it can be, and with only one site, why upgrade? The good thing is that it's no longer an aggressive rivalry. I'm sure several people only chose sides based on where they ended up first and inherited this competition, so being able to attend both serves for self improvement and a separate perspective.

"Celebrate the freedom of your country by blowing up a small portion of it"I'm usually never home on the Fourth, so I never get to see my town's fireworks (the rain date of which is, oddly enough, July 4th) Fireworks have been banned in my town for a long time because some idiot blew off his hand many years ago. Only recently have they started again. On the fourth I was at the Erie canal in Tonawanda at a friend's boat.So a happy Fourth, and Canada Day because... they're happy.Oh, and hey, buy a new hand with your $1000.

haha when was the last time arkon wanted us to be happy... naw this will be cool i guess.  I mean its still gayer than a Michael jackson blow up doll just not quite as frightening.  Arkon and psysoinic in the same community, this time as webmasters....fuck.

'( *cries in pain*  stupid fireworks and stupid guy who paid me $1000 bux to set em off for him and his 80+ yr old parents. i caught my hand on fire last night. thumb at first and middle finger and back of hand got 3rd degree burns. )Now you understand why pyrotechnicians use something called a clacker-box to initiate fireworks. :)

Okay, Delphi is bored and has too much time on her hands, so... Time MachineJikuu Tensou Souchi -Jikuu means 'space-time'-Tensou means 'transfer/transmission'-Souchi means either 'meadow' (which I'm sure that's not what it's used for in this sense), 'equipment/apparatus', or 'sending/forwarding' (which is probably the right one). So uh... something about sending Ecco forward in time or something like that, probably.Sadou Kaishi-Sadou means either 'movement' or... this is kinda funny... the 'way of tea or tea ceremony'-Kaishi means a few things... mysterious death, folding paper, or um... 'start/commencement/beginning'.So I'm guessing it's like 'transfer initiated' or something (from the English Ecco).I have to skip all the ones where you put brackets because... let's face it, I don't know how to type things like backwards e's without the help of my HTML book (which I can't find at the moment). So that's about all I can do for you. Anyway, have fun with the others...

Irrational hate for something you have no influence or control over is pointless and stupid.

gayier then a micheal jackson blow up doll?anyways, im making a point and that point is without the rivalry I can work in peace. I have better things to do with my time ya know ;)

the game that convinced me to buy a Megadrive so long ago....Ecco was the only reason I dished out the money for a PS2. Well worth it though. Plus I can play other games too, if I ever find a need for them

I just gave up on that game and used the level select code! I never got past "process that never" ends....And for Noriko,I have a pool in my back yard,but it's only 3 feet deep and 15 feet around,so I guess you have a better time anyway!

Ecco DOTF was extremly glitchy.There would be times when I would get caught in a rock or something,or get stuck on land.And have absoulutly no chance of getting out.I have also heard reports of people somehow getting caught outside of the game map.I hope the next Ecco game is a bit more 'solid'.  :?

<div id='container'>
Ah ahhahahhaa....I can't believe how funny some of those were! While I agree with some of the resemblances...(it's amazing how much they match some people)...but I sure as hell hope I'm not exactly like Bliss Ninny...hehehe! I mean, how often do I really make "utterly vacuous comments"...? Are my posts that empty, blank, lacking intelligence, stupid, pointless, insane...(to define vacuous)...? Oh well...heheh...they were funny...that's for sure! How did you stumble upon that site there Arkon...? Pretty cool... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have also heard reports of people somehow getting caught outside of the game map.Yup...it's true. There's actually lots of places you can go "outside the level". PsySonic has searched a lot and made a section about it if your really interested. I've never really searched for places...but found one on accident while playing the PS2 version of Defender of the Future. It was in Atlantis Lost where you have to get the 5 shards of the guardian...one of them being in a cave/room you have to sonar the door in order to get in. Well, if you look around the door's intrance, near the ground, on one side, you can actually swim out and you'll be underneath the level! It's so crazy to see the levels like that! I'd be coming up underneath the level's ocean floor...and the sand would fly up...but I couldn't break through it...heh!There's another good one too in Four Ways of Mystery...after the eel chase...you can nuzzle your way back through the rocks that block it's path...and Ecco, on his own, will swim a straight path back to the main room...then you can swim back down the tunnel and swim right up to the eel that was chasing you and he won't even notice yer there! The first time I did that...I was freaked out...hehe! But yea...DotF was quite glitchy in that aspect.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY KITNEE     
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I hear ya guys! Or like...have any of you managed to accidentally beach Ecco?!  8O ...heheh, I did the first time I played Perils of the Cora Reef! In the area of the Great White...being scared...I jumped onto the sand for some reason...perhaps trying to jump over it...and it took forever to get him off that sand! Oh yea...also happened once in Antlantis lost...somewhere in the area where the water's shallow...and you have to keep going through it to get to one of the Guardian's shards. It's always not fun having to watch Ecco drown to his death...or like when he's poisoned, and dying...and there's no pokey-fish around to be found!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I want an MP3 sooooo baaaad,but my mom said not until I can pay for it myself. My sis has taken like,59 tests so don't feel too bad. :D

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heheh...well, they made the site cause that's their business...Woofles, a Doggy Diner. They didn't make it due to the fictious character Crestoe made up, William and his bark, "woofles"...it's just ironic there's a site that has to do with it all...hehe! Okay...now Alastor...explain how you stumbled upon this site anyway?!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sten: Yeah - its hard when friends find out about the others sexuality *sighs* Thats why I have only told my friends Sophie, Dom - and you guys. I'm just glad that you guys accepted my choice ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sweet D In otherwords, the movement would be Ecco's body through the time stream - the beginning is the past, etc etc.or as you (Kitnee) put it D *dances about* 0o; Yeeeiii!! XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aww...that's too bad Lizza...here's hoping it'll be up and running soon! And Kitnee...wow, seems your a big Sailor Moon fan, eh?! Anyway, nice work (though those big scans took a while to load...heh)! I really liked your Lion King artwork...you've done nice work! Keep it up! :D

In Roaring Forces, after becoming a fish, I managed to pass through a wall and swim in the water beyond the gate. The level finished when I tried to get back in. Recently, in perpetual fluidity, I was in a room where you needed to raise the water. But when you did, the tube closed. I thought I was being clever and went inside the tube and sonared it shut from there, but the exit closed too. Outside the tube was one of those dolphins that says stuff like "You're our only hope" so I swam over and drown in front of him. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A man and a woman were going to get married, and they approached a priest they new and asked for him to wed them.The priest replied,"Well, I will under one condition; you must not have sex until you are officially married." etc.I don't understand this joke... :?

<div id='container'>
Well... happy birthday anyway! If it makes you feel a little better, I'm sure I'll fail my drivers the first time, too. Guaranteed, in fact. Um... my cousin said that when she went to do it, the instructor told her that 'she'd better practice her driving for a LOOOOOONG time before she attempted the test again'. So... you're not that bad off. You can always do it again  8)

Heh heh! ^_^ I like finding out what the original games/anime say, too, because I'm one o' those "subbed-not-dubbed"er's. Except games with text - then English is neccessary! O.o; But whenever I play Sonic Adventure 1 &amp; 2, I always have the voices set to Japanese. I was so mad when Grandia II didn't use the Japanese voices!

<br />

Heh...anyway, I was thinking the same thing you guys were, Callyfin and Delphi... ;) ...that one you suggested sounds like Shadow, Callyfin...the description really does fit him well...huh?! And...yep, I was nodding my head when I read your post Delphi about Cally and Trellia... ;) ...hehe! But, they're like that in a good way I'd say... :D ...in a way they should be almost!
</div>

Awesome Crestoe... :D ...as soon as I get all that information down, I'll be sendin it off!

Heheh...yeah, like HazardousRaptor said...DotF is very glitchy! Oh well, some of 'em are fun to play around with...no?! Anyway, yeah...I understood what you meant Stenellya...mainly because I did the same thing to get Ecco un-beached. If you just roll his body, usually that works. But, sometimes it doesn't...and you just have to wail him around till he gets un-stuck...hehe! But, I'm sure that when you said "trick"...you meant how you can make him "roll"... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh my goodness Callyfin... 8O :D ...those drawings are amazing! I really like that new one of Crestoe...the details are incredible! And that new Art Contest piece of yours...I absolutely love it! I love how you were able to get soooo many aspects of the Ecco games, into one drawing! And they were all so wonderfully depicted... ;) ...awesome job!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oooooh... :D ...very cool Doomtrain! I love the white cloud/fog/smoke effect at the bottom...and that's an awesome dolphin there! I'm serious...I don't know how on earth Shadow's gonna choose!?!
</div>

<div id='container'>
Ah hah...so that's a picture of Jader...huh?! What was she doing in it? Anyway, for some reason I like it...I mean...the 3 different colored ones of the same pic...:)...looks cool.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'll bet Trellia... :D ...make sure to let us know how it all came out! And, that goes for the rest of ya who's got books out there... ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sorry yer sad Sten... D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Uhm... :? ...I dunno...? I actually have much longer hair than Kitnee though (it's mid to lower back length), so maybe it's harder for me to see the resemblance...heh...I just have it pinned up in that pic. In comparing our pictures, I noticed the light in that pic really isn't that good. I'm going to have to find one where you can see my face more. But...I guess...maybe in a way...?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehehehe...I can only guess that maybe you don't get the ending that holds the "punch line"...the thing about "Home Depot"...? I only assumed this due to your location...and that those stores may not be over there where you live. Home Depot is a home improvement store...where you buy things such as lightbulbs (and other things dealing with fixing up your home)...like the joke talks about...ehhehe...anyway, I thought it was funny! Maybe that'll help Sten...:)...? If not, yea...what about it don't you get?

Erm...what do you not get about it, Sten?I don't understand the underlined part:"There is something we must admit to you..." the man said. The priest looked at him. "Have you remained abstinant like I asked you?" The man and the woman looked at each other. The man replied,"I'm sorry. She was screwing in a lightbulb and she dropped it. She leaned over to pick it up and I was so overcome with lust that I couldn't help myself."

Well, Cally, technically it Leina, but since the Japanese have no "L" sound, they use the "R" sound.   Kinda like in Grandia 2 - the girl's name is Elena, but they would pronunce it ERENA. o.o;Yus, Nori...evil, evil, dubs.  8O

<div id='container'>
Ah doomtrain you should remember...Why did you start this topic anyway? If you think our society is so based upon sex then why bring it up even more? We all know how it works, it's part of everyday life, so what? If people are uncomfortable talking about it then that's their choice I'm sure they don't need someone else telling them to be more open about their sexuality. And this whole gay/lesbian/bisexual thing, sure people can choose what they want to be and maybe they don't have a choice, maybe it's just the way they are but underneath all that crap everyone is the same so why should anyone get special treatment just because their preference is sensitive to society? By the way Callyfin don't you think you're a little young to already know who you are sexually? I mean most people are confused for a long time, before they realize and have the courage to tell their families. And why does it matter to anyone in here if someone else here is bi or gay. Come on it's the internet we don't need to get that personal.

Well when i was a small child drinking bleach i came up with the idea that maybe ecco absorbed the life force of the asterite.... O_O yeah nevermind trying to explain it that part didnt make any sense.And i can actually get through the hungry ones in the lower part as a dolphin.  Just swim like hell.  You'll lose all your health but you can amke it right before you die.

I've been recently thinking about all of the several characters on this forum and wanted to know just that. Aside from the short description in fanfare, it really doesn't come up. A few I know (like Arkon) and others I can't even guess at. So just take the time here to speak in depth about your character which for some, if not most people, is the pride of your creativity.(I'm not going to leave myself out, though I've gone through it a couple times)-Artreus. Grows up friends with two dolphins named Cassiopeia and Orion. After the death of his mother, he begins to search for adventure. Something new to spice things up.-The Rising Project. The dolphins that make up the Rising (including Artreus) were selected in ancient times to defend the seas from the return of a powerful enemy. Though not truly immortal, at the end of each life they begin another life, with no memories of the previous. This is to make certain that when their enemy arrives, they will be prepared, but not have the agony of watching the world pass by them. Rising dolphins have limited powers, which can only be renewed by those who began the project.These are played out in my fanfics and If you have an interest in any other characters, I suggest you PM me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah yes, great shading- adds substance to the picture. You put good detail into Crestoe, and I like Ecco. You even managed to toss in an Orca :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Whitefin is an ancient dolphin whom was one of the princesses of Atlantis - and also witnesed its birth and destruction.Whitefin was born as a dolphin on the night of a full moon, and is currently 167 million years old.  Her true Atlantean name is Thirakaga, which later became the start of her species scientific name, Thira Totara - with Totara being the Atlantean word for prehistoric. Her parents where the first rulers of Atlantis - in which they joined blood with Aveniriana's (Trellia's) family.When the destruction of Atlantis came due to the hands of the vortex - Whitefin, and what other survivors remained changed to they're dolphin forms and roamed the ocean. When the rest of the pod died off, Whitefin relized that she would be alone - forever.When Dolphins began to evolve into smaller bodies, with small fins, and sleek silver bodies - Whitefin felt rejected, as with every pod she attempted to join - she was sent back because she was different. She journeyed into the arctic waters and saw the big blue. He told her that she should return to Atlantis - for time would tell her fate if she stayed with her ancestorie and birthplace. With that she traveled to the ruins of Atlantis again - on her way she came across the Asterite. He said that she didn't belong in the current oceans, and that she was banished to guard the ruins of Atlantis. Filled with a deep rage, she attacked the Asterite - sending one of his globes into the past, where it became a part of his past entity. With that, she fled into Atlantis, and was never heard of again.A millenia passed, and Ecco was born into the waters of the present. Along his journey - when he made his way into Atlantis, he was attacked by Whitefin. After Ecco was beaten by her, he told her why he needed to be here. Whitefin was angered when she found out about the Winds of Water, as she though that after Atlantis - the vortex had left Earth for good. She took him through Atlantis, and to the time machine. During his time in the past - Whitefin heard the voice of Dolphinina call, telling her of what Ecco truely was. She encountered Ecco again when he returned with the power of the Asterite, he used the machine again to go back to the time when the winds of water happened - and destroied the vortex. Little did he know that the Queen had followed him. Whitefin set fin out of Atlantis, feeling the sudden cry of the ocean again - she went to the Asterite, and found him to be gone. She went to the Bay of the Two Tides, the dolphins in panic because they couldn't feel the Astrites presence in the ocean any more - the screams of the Vortex was all they could feel. Whitefin then witnessed Ecco meeting Trellia, and when Ecco was taken into the future - Whitefin followed - using the song of the time stream, she went into the good future, she met Trellia and the Trella Bay pod - and remained there during the threat of the Vortex kind on earth in the present. She returned after Ecco had thrown himself into the time stream - and she rid The City of Forever of the Vortex Larva. Now - 20 years AE (After Ecco), the Vortex Return, taking over Atlantis, and draining life from the land and sea again. Whitefin forms a resistance with four pods around the globe, and the alien race - the Thrivians. Before they attacked, Trellia and Whitefin where both sucked into a time vortex - and where sent to the Vortex Future, in which they met NeoEcco, they freed Neo from the Globe Holder, and returned to the present. They attacked Atlantis, and when they worked their way to the Queen, she killed Whitefin. The Spirits of her Ancestors brought her back, turning her into the Queen of the Ocean - the great goddess Angelfin. She killed the Queen, and rose the island of Atlantis from the ocean into a volcanic, underground cavern. The people of her past that fled through the time machine, and that where taken by the mightly glyph where brought back into the timeline and began to live in Atlantis, once again. Whitefin fell in love with the high council member - Zealot. She and Zealot have been mates ever since.The end :D

Thanks to Arkonviox for hosting this new forum. I hope everyone likes it here, I know I do! So, let's get the discussion going! :)Have fun!

(This info is mirrored in the Hacking the ROM section of the site, located at//ecco2beta.2ya.com/hacking.htmlHere's how to change the levels you can pick in the Debug Menu. Open up your ecco2beta.bin file in a hex editor of your choice, and find offset 3AA5. it should read "12". Change this to "50" in the hex panel and you'll raise your maximum selectable level to 80!  changing this number ALSO can change the rate that you scroll through numbers in the stage number section (i.e. by 2's or 4's.)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Are you sure this'll be the last board? It might be just a salmon.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This'll be the last. No ads, works like YABB, and hosted on a good server. Works for me, and I think everyone's going to like it a lot. )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Also note that in levels above 18, you can access bizarre versions of levels. i.e. the Asterite Cave with bubbles instead of globes! If you use sonar to bring up a map, you'll end up changing the sprites and colors of the level, too. Same effect can occur when trying to change levels from the Debug Menu again from one of these bug levels. You can even end up with the Asterite's 2 globes turning into rotating baby Orca sprites or even LETTERS. Bizarre.. Also, note that Level 80 is the swimming intro level leftover from Ecco 1. Move Ecco to the right to put him onscreen and you can move him around, do flips and such. Sonar maps do not work here.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey everyone. i did some changes to the forums as you can see. the forum is now shared with another website called http://ecco2beta.2ya.com/Epicenter mods his own forum for his site and we got an awesome thing going between the both of our sites.Make sure to check out his site and his forum! anyways thought id let you know whats going on.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Looks right to me... Except that the level is in Ecco 1. Ecco 2's level is unnamed except with the Debug menu, which calls it INSIDE.Of course, seeing how I'm not the one who posted the anagram in the first place, I'm probably not the best judge.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Considering the word was either going to salmon or "fooglemuffin" I think salmon made more sense.But then again, what do I know? After all, I'm just someone with a recolored Magus for a side image.Man, those buttons for Submit and Preview are hard to read. Or maybe it's just me. Or maybe just someone pretending to be me. Or maybe me pretending to be someone pretending to be me.Man, I've gotta lay off the caffeine at 1:45 in the morning.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Level 80 is the same as 2. Which coincidentally is impossible to drown on, thus foiling any attempts at hacking a name for it in the rom.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This will be interesting cause well see a combination of Arkonviox.com and Ecco 2 Beta people around here. I relly hope you like the forum. I never tried anything like this before i wish i could of gotten you your very own exclusive forum but i plan to make this forum fit a look for both our sites. I'm gonna ask PsySonic to join here as well, I don't want him to get mad about all this. Thats why the idea scared me a little bit. I just seen you been having prolems with all your other forums and thought about the best possible thing i could do.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Levels in the menu above 18 tend to point to different dtages in a pseudo-random fashion .. I get the Ecco 1 swimming intro when I do it. You may be accessing it through the Demo Editor .. which could produce much different results. I recommend you hack a copy of the ROM to allow more levels to be accessed from Debug. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yep, cool, I'd like to see him start talking here. Thanks, Arkon! :)

I just looked through the final Ecco 2 ROM (mine anyway, it's kind of .. strange, it may not be 100% final), and there's still text for the Demo Editor (B+C+Start during Vortex Falls Into Water sequence.) If someone  could find out what format is sused to denote what keys to hold and push to bring up the menu, we could find out if  there's still a way to that Editor in the final, and what buttons to push to get to it!

If we did find that a editor still existed in the final - imaging what we could find. What are the chances that all the base Beta data *for levels and such* is locked away somewhere in the roms/carts? It'd be nice if we could find out :)

Stenellya is a mysterious atlantean she-dolphin with special powers. Her origins are unknown at the moment.One of her friend (I'll present her soon with a drawing...) is a protector of the glyphs and of the magic songs of the ocean.I would like Whitefin to be a other friend of Stenellya, but I don't know if Callyfin is alright, and I know Trellia will always be the most important character in Whitefin's story...Then...

You don't need to hack the debug... Just use the Demo editor to go to level 127 and you can go down to lower levels. Just don't hit right or it'll go to (I think) level -5.Besides, the level is the same either way. I don't think there would be much difference in how the levels are loaded, besides the Life/Air bit.

To the right of the floating Island/sea/whatever is a tube. You have to jump into it at a certain height and charge/power (Whatever the C-button swimming is called) swim up, and you'll get into Tube of Medusa. Which happens to be just like in Hard mode.

How fun! ^^ And superb piccies, Eao!Kitnee grew up as being one of Ecco's best friends, always accompanying him on his little treasure hunts and childish games. Once Ecco became older, he started his grand adventures. But Kitnee always kept in touch with him. After the first battle with the Vortex, Ecco returned to his good friend and introduced her to the Asterite. Kitnee was awed by the supreme being and wanted to help protect it. So Kitnee became the Asterite's protector. However...One dark day, the Vortex came again. Fighting for her own safety, Kitnee hid in a small alcove in the Asterite's cave. She watched in horror as the Asterite was destroyed, its last two globes hidden away, cursing herself, for she was not strong enough to fulfill her promised duty as Asterite's Protector. After the Queen and her cronies left, Kitnee swam as fast as she could: she needed to find Ecco and tell him what had happened! She found refuse in a dark bay, where the only light was your own sonar. Ecco stumbled upon her - Kitnee was overjoyed. After Ecco saved a small orca calf, Kitnee sang what she had witnessed to her old friend. Ecco swam off, determined to right the wrongs.  Ecco destroyed the Vortex for the second and final time.Then, the Foe came.The dolphins and other sea animals decided to build a grand protector, similar to their beloved Asterite, lost in the years prior.  Kitnee and a few other dolphins and whales constructed the Guardian, a crystaline being of immense power. Familiar with protecting, Kitnee was dubbed the Guardian's Watcher. And when the Guardian was shattered, Kitnee despaired, for she felt she had failed in her duites. Although the others tried to tell her that she could not have possibly prevented the shattering, Kitnee still felt at fault. But she knew how to amend this. She quickly created information shards out of the shattered pieces of the Guardian, and scattered them among the sea, throughout the fabrics of time, using the old Time Machine, buried deep in a cove in Atlantis. She knew that Ecco would find these shards, and that he would make the world right again. And so, she waited, as always, for Ecco. For she knew that he would always perservere.The End. XD

Lizza, the forum looks strange to eao because shes in earth clan, and she sees 2 different forums then you.  So yes eao the forum is fucked up because for some reason the archives forum is missing and the earth clan forum is no longer in its own catagory.  Which you probably figured out but its my job to tell you this shit. -_-And thats crazy because deven told me that he didnt need arkon's forums!

Haha dg that reminds me....Arkon what the fuck is up with this?  Every time you get a new program, forumn or whatever you always forget to take off the fucking censor.  Now there is an option take it off, right arkon?  I know you didn't get "Postnuke: Castration Edition".

Heh, oops, my mistake. I meant to make E2B Researcher a rank for over 100 posts or so on the E2B Seciton, but apparently it refers to posters on the whole forum ... Arkon, do you think you can make the post-related ranks just say nothing, and keep the assigned ones?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Actually, I found using the Demo Editor was a real bitch. For example, if you activate the Demo Editor, that means the demo that was playing (i.e. the vortex queen falling) ends up stashed in memory somewhere and consequently, the levels over 18 and below -5 end up oftentimes being those demos. It's fun to swim around in the demos, but if you want to visit the other levels it's not useful. Also, in the Demo Editor I think you need to set a time limit, so you may get kicked out of the level and back to the Demo Editor after about 30 seconds, and changing the time to more than 30 seconds means hitting B (I think) a hell of a lot of times.  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F.   A = 11, B = 12, etc. On the left side of your hex editor you'll see the offset for the FIRST byte (two characters) of that line.For example, for this hack, you might see)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm... well it was really Tidesinger and Swift Current that made me up (thanks to both!!!). My original name was Doomtrain, then Swifty drew that pic of me as a metalic dolphin with a skull and cross bones on my head (my face pic, of course). Then in Tidesingers story I became "project Doomtrain", an artificial dolphin made with the same technology as the Guardian to protect the seas after the time of Ecco.... but I was apparently needed sooner then that! o.o;

I'm working on a hack for Ecco 2 Beta that is sort of a mix of E2B and E2 Final. I'm renaming the levels to their correct names from the Final, fixing messages, setting the Debug Menu's max level to the correct value from Ecco 2 Final, and since there's not enough room to turn "I KNOW WHERE IS THE CAVE" into "FOLLOW ME ECCO,I KNOW THE WAY TO THE SEA OF DARKNESS", I'm making it "I KNOW THE WAY TO THE SNO-CONE MACHINE". ;)  Any other suggestions for things I could add?Note)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the bestw ay to probably find info from old mags about the ecco 2 beta would be to find it while it was in display. like a preview. i'll look through my old mags to see if i got anything. hey if you have some old mags with any info on the 32x ecco let me know. old mags are hard to come across.

Actually, Ark, the level in the final that most resembles this one (Skyway) has the tube reaching all the way to the water, with a Glyph blocking the way. The Glyphs were replaced by bubbles, though, but are in a different level, Skylands.

<br />

<div id='container'>
...Use the Asterite's final sprites. Don't try to name level 10, it'll screw up Moray Abyss. Fix the Time Machine. Change the Crabs to either Eels or Magic Arms.Of course, there are other things you can do, but that's what I've done.

Just use the Demo menu once, putting yourself at 127, then Debug menu down a level each time. Assuming you go down one level each time, you won't miss any, except below -5.

I would like Whitefin to be a other friend of Stenellya, but I don't know if Callyfin is alright, and I know Trellia will always be the most important character in Whitefin's story...Then...It'd be cool with me if Stenellya and Whitefin where friends ^_^ I have barely writen anymore of the whitefin trillogy as well - you know what that means? *hinthint* :)

Well, that's still too much trouble for me ) Also note that by moving the %d's, %ld's, etc. you can change where the menus accept input.

<div id='container'>
How'd you do all that? I know how to change the Asterite's sprites ..  but I don't have an Ecco pallette to work with .. do you have one you can send me? (my e-mail address is in my sig.) As for the time machine, how'd you fix it, and what does it do differently? Just no blocks fall on you? :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
To Cally?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The colors, not  the blocks. I could set Ecco's colors right, but that would screw up some blocks and pillars... I don't do coding yet. I have a reasonable palette, but it only has Ecco's and the Machine thing's colors. You can tell what everything is, though....If only I knew assembly... Then I could set the palettes correct to the final... And set the block in level 7 to be an actual block, not just a piece of background...

In the 3D Stages, if you pause the game (push start), you will see at the top some text. Push UP and DOWN to change DIFFICULTY, LEFT and RIGHT will change TIME DECREMENT.

The blocks on the time machine are a trap, the blocks are actually still there in the Ecco One final D I like the sno cone thing. Cute. As for sprites, and sprite colours etc - go to Trellia's Bay *its one of Arkonviox.com's affiliates*, Trellia has sprites there with the true colours in there. Also, do you think its possible for the vortex queen to be set so you can kill her XD That'd be cool.

Hmm... There's probably a way to remove the actual blocks... But it might remove part of the time machine, too. Notice how in the final, Ecco sonars the RIGHT dish... A connection, perhaps?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, its really odd. I alway see the right cup as the bouncer, and the left cup as the reciever. The left cup isn't as deep as the right, and only had one ring around its edge. The right cup looks deeper, and had the double ring on the cup edge. Atlanteans made confusing things :D

Heh, yeah, I knew what it meant .. :) Just not in the context of the E2B 3D Stages. I tried changing this setting .. didn't seem to do anything. I left it on 4 and went through 4 rings in a row, stage did not end. Set it to 16, went through 4, didn't end .. (16+4=20, so I thought they MIGHT have a 20-ring quota set up..)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I always get Skylands and Skyway confused .. which one is the level in the BETA?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It's a combination of both. The level most resembles Skyway, but has the floating bit from Skylands. At least, the above-water bit looks like Skyway. Under water is pretty much completely new- err, old. There's a rock or something on the bottom of the level. It looks like part of the background except it falls and lands on the ground. You can push it around, too.

I said it resembles Skyway. The Glyphs were changed to the bubbles, which were only in Skylands.Look at the area around the exit. It's slightly different to the final, but the resemblance to Skyway is uncanny.

"Combination of skyway and skylands" is unnecessarily complicated.  Its skylands.  Even though there are a few architectural similarities, the main gimmick of flying is basically all we need to figure it out.  Unless that bastard Annuitza escapes from his padded room long enough to tell us what was really going on.  And the level ecco is in with the tubes and moving screen is Sky Tides.

Tails151, do you suppose you could send me the pallette again please, and an IPS patch to the fixed Time Machine ROM? I could use it as a base for the new hack. I viewed your email on another machine and now can't get at it on this one.  :?

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Question...does it still show when someone edits their post...or when someone else edits someone's post? I've seen it on there a few tiems...but..never see it attached to my own when I edit them. Or, does everyone esle see it besides me...? I know I may not be making much sense...but...do ya got an answer for me...Arkon...or Shadow...test
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I wouldn't call it a sudden change...at least not for Arkon or Silverfin. PsySonic...now that I'd call a sudden change. From what Arkon told me a while ago, he and Silverfin have been talking for a long while now...and in fact, if I'm not mistaken, Silverfin helped Arkon along with his decisions. So, thanks Silverfin... ;)

SilverFins hella cool. but i don't expect to see him around for a while him and PsySonic have been working alot at there jobs. I know how crazy that can be doing that and workin gon the site. i try to do that alot.It took a long time to happen. For a long time i was going about things all wrog by attacking them. Then two people contacted me siverfin and oni dark link. and we talked and tried to come up with a plan. psysonic was still relly pissed about the things i did. i know it was hard for him to decide but alot of help goes to epicenter which you all know runs the beta forum!anyways im glad we are working together!

...Aw. I wish I had a cool story to go with my character. ;_; But unfortunately, I wasn't blessed with the gift of being able to write. But what can ya do? *shrug* Anyways...my character is pretty mysterious. Considering I can't come up with anything really original or creative to be in a story about her. =D She's kind of like a mermaid...more like a sea person, though. 'Cuz she has legs, no tail. She's got fins on her arms and legs and one on her back. She only speaks with dolphins...and sometimes the occasional whale. She doesn't really like to be around any other type of creature and she really likes to play. And she likes shiny things.  :D But she can't remember her past. At all. Heh. Ah shink that'sh about it. ._o Sorry if I bored you to death. *dies*

http://arkonviox.com/fanfare/fanartwork/eao_23.jpgdar she blows!  Lady Leviathain (also 'water' protector to another story)it's an old drawing, and one of the best of her, though I've made her head slender more.see, all my 'magic' creaturs are pain in the necks to draw.torn beast-looks like a dragon with 4 tusks going like an elephant up and elephant down. Has fangs/tusks going from the jaw up, and from the skull down (fangs come before lower fangs I think) eyebrow horns like triceratops, horns jutting backwards, nose horn, cheek bone horns.and thats just his head.He has a tail with spikes, playes and quills, his back has spiked plate-quills, sholders have horns elbows and knees, wrists...oh and huge sycthicl like claws.(I need a stegosaurid dino guide)see, I cannot draw these chimeras...Lady Levi is just one artfull abomanation...can anyone suggest the best sculpting material?  that won't melt in heat?not craola clay, not sculpty.so who's up for the challange?  Crestoe?  Vantid? Swifty?  Whitefin?can the best, best these beasts?  Can the world see them as I try to?(I think in 3d, but cannot draw it)so try the first...the water guaridan....animals that include her (water is a feminane elemental?)dolphin(tail fin #1 'dorcal' fin, nose/head, overall shape mixed with snake...primary hand fins are close to the head)lionfish(wings)cat fish(wiskers)snake(length and shape, also head shape mixed with the dolphin)Oar fish (the giant dorcel fin)basic fish (pectoral fins, other fins, 'ear' fins, anal fin, tail fin #2I think there may be fins on the side of her body...like a flying fish.color?  blues and greys...like a shark world or dolphin.  I may make her "invisable" because water is clear (another reason she's a bitch to draw) so make her ocean colors with no backgrounddrawing certain body parts will be hard because of those wings (taken from dalfyen and dolfyn) because they cover so much.  then again what you don't see dosen't have to be drawin ;P (just because you draw a bush dosen't mean there is or isn't a naked person behind it ;P)*note* emotional/mental stablity may falter while drawing...I have no idea what my feelings will be from the out come...My best bet to draw this is to sculpt it (theres that 3d thing again) so it dosen't automaticly mean I will love or hate it or say "eurika thats it!" or "what no, no ,no not at all"so who's up for the challange...rerember -you- are drawin' I, will get the real one some how.how though do you combine almost every genra of swimming verdibrate into one animal?

We probably wont have it anytime soon but it will happen.

I've seen sonic people have made their own levels.... we could build the long lost ecco 3 for genesis if we wanted to.  Of course for some reason i cant run savestates but i would still like the screenshoits :D

It's possible to modify the sprites in Ecco through Hex, but there's programs that edit the 16x16 tiles that are MUCH easier to use. If you want, you can check out Tile Layer Pro. To view the sprites, or edit them, you can use the program Tile Layer Pro, and the palette file for E2B (.tlp file). You need both. You can search for Tile Layer Pro on google, and you can get the palette from me or Tails151. I'm not good at editing art in 16x16 chunks, though, so I haven't really messed with it.Histronic, yea, we probably will know this ROM inside and out eventually, but we're going to need some experienced hackers. Maybe we can get someone from Area51 to come and do some research on the ROM's internal workings. I'm trying to figure it out myself, but it's very slow going.BTW .. Histronic, what emulator are you using? No sound, no savestates.. it sounds like it sucks ;) I use Gens .. it's really nice. It has sound, Sega CD Support, 5 or so graphics engines to enhance the image so it looks REALLY cool (but you need a 400 MHz or faster machine for it to run quickly in some of the modes). The only problem with it is that it can't handle The Machines in Ecco games' backgrounds properly-- they tend to flicker and twitch, and it can't properly run Sonic 2's splitscreen mode.

Phosis was "chosen" to defend the world from an ancient darkness that arose. His companion Otair awoke the evil by pure accident, and they both feel it is up to them to stop it. Phosis is a very paranoid, lazy singer. He does not want to save anything. He does it only because he has no where else to go. The evil they awoke was an ancient god who was banished for eternity into a device called the Fantastic Blue. He comes back in the form of the creature who resurrected him, which was a dolphin. at the beginning of the story, his power is great, but among gods, very minimal. As the story continues, his power rises, and he becomes closer to becoming a god, and ridding himself of a weak dolphin body. He creates an army familiar to dolphin kind; A vortex-esque race of alien creatures to do his bidding. Phosis and Otair, seperated from the rest of their party, find out that their is no way they can defeat him as they are, and they soon seek the aid of Ecco, The Time Strider. Ecco, Unfortunately has been presumed dead for 500 years, so first they must travel north to collect information from a mysterious singer. The story continues after that, but I won't spoil it. The ending might surprise you, and will most definitely lead off into a sequel. Well, thats all I got.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
BTW, the singer they meet in the north is not the big blue. I try to stay close to the game, (not to close mind you) and keep the fact that the Big Blue has been long dead for the past 500 years. If you want to really know who the singer is, think back to the video in the Tides Of Time. Who went with ecco to the hard waters? You are all smart. Im sure you can figure it out   :D

its not an emulation bug. it happens while your morphed and attemp to pick another level. then what happens is the two levels collide into one.

I talked with a person a while back about a website that existed long time ago called "Stars of Ecco" which existed before the undercaves era. 1997 and before. I was told it was a big community, bigger then us (which is laughable) and was the first true ecco website.My opinion on this was this is the biggest load of bullshit i ever heard. My guess was pre 1997 there wasnt alot of internet activity like there is now. I thought id bring this topic up to see if anyone here can tell me what internet was like in the pre 1997 days way back when. could there have possibly been another ecco site?from what i know the undercaves was the first and biggest community on ecco the dolphin to exist. i might have seen stars of ecco but it was probably too small and not as fancy as what we got now for me to care. still im not sure if it was the first ecco the dolphin community it should be interesting to see.Anyways i thought i'd tell you guys about that.

<div id='container'>
hee hee, look at him go.

<div id='container'>
No, it was definitely the undercaves.   Before the undercaves all searches for "ecco" resulted in sites about that damn shoe store.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah arkon considering the marble sea was ecco 1 i doubt it
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Haha i use genecyst, and sometimes kgen for those "polygonal" games like skitchen since it handles them better....  my computer just sucks since it got toasted by a surge.  It's dos mode doesnt even recognize the d drive any more so i have to play all my dos games in windows... its crap.  Buy siurge protectors, everyone.

<br />

<div id='container'>
I remember Stars of Ecco, in fact - it was the first Ecco fansite I found. It was a piddly little thing, and then I found the Undercaves a while later... a WHIL later o.o. Do not think that I couldn't of stumbled across it because of my age at the time - I was using the internet when I was 7 and we first got it. But yes, there was a Stars of Ecco, but no - it was a pissant little community.

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
how long ago was this whitefin?yeah theres this girl i know who just rambles how it was this big assed community and it was way better then the undercaves. I think this is a bunch of crap cause the undercaves from what we all know was the first and biggest community on ecco on the net. hell my site wouldnt exist now if it werent for the undercaves.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey hist frunny you bring that up. ecco is a very popular shoe brand. i know cause i work in wemens shoes. unfortunatly my store doesnt sell them because were located in the ghetto where no one can afford eccos. a bunch of crap if you ask me.

Gens used to run Sonic 2 perfectly... But then they "fixed" it. Gens does fix the Globe Holder problem that Genecyst has, though.It's a shame, though... Genecyst doesn't work on my computer... Probably just this one installation of Windows...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Around late 1997 - early 1998. I've lost the link though when I moved to using a Mac.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmm, I use Gens and the Globe Holder still floats offscreen .. Also, Histronic, I think the problem with your computer is 1. The surge may have killed your D) All Windows installations do that sometime .. you should probably back up your data, reformat, reinstall. Give Gens a try, it's a really nice Emu. ) Linux doesn't need to be reinstalled fortunately..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The other problem. Look at the actual sprite in Gens and Genecyst. The one in Gens is round completely, but Genecyst has a bunch of blocks in it where the colors don't match.That idea from the first post inspired me to spend more time than I probably should have on this hack. Apply it to the beta, and go to any level besides Tube of Medusa (Level 11) or City of Forever (Level 14).

<br />

<div id='container'>
haha thanks ep i think i'll do that  Though i think the surge did in fact screw witht the inside of the computer, or the people who fixed it might have did something to it.  Thy're called the a team.   I dont trust someone whose named after mr. t's show to be fixing computers.

well i need someone to find the link to the site.then i can use http://www.archive.org to find it.

LOL! The crabs are toasters! I see, this was Eoraptor's suggestion D Great job! Do you suppose, for v1.5, you could turn Ecco into the new 3D sprite somehow?

<br />

<div id='container'>
come on you guys have to have some old magazines with soemthing about ecco.

<div id='container'>
Also, you could add the new Pallette for the Time Machine, and put in the Asterite's new sprites.. then I could do the reprogramming to make it work more like the final game.

The green status bars are kinda hard to fix, seeing how there were no greens in Ecco's original palette. And what 3d sprite are you talking about?

I'm working on my own personal rendition of the New Machine. This takes a very, very long time to do well, so I'm only maybe 15% done. Here's links to two camera-shots of it so far. I know they're blurry, but once it's done, I'll scan and post the whole thing. What do you think? //epicenter.2ya.com/img/machine1.jpghttp://epicenter.2ya.com/img/machine2.jpg

Arkonviox and I have started a new Usergroup for anyone who wants to contribute to the new Ecco v1.5 Hack, to merge E2B and the Final Version together through graphics, code, and perhaps sound/music, and other things, to produce a blend of the two. If you would like to join, please reply to this thread and tell me what you'd like to do. Even giving ideas is fine. :) The group is called "The Globes", i.e. the Asterite, a number of individual globes working together. To go to the User Group, click "usergroups" below the Arkonviox.com banner above.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'll join. I can do palettes and some graphics. Don't ask me to mess with the sonar map, though. I've managed to make the black in it blue, but not get rid of the greens.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Done, you're in. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Also note that anyone working on the hack has access to a private forum for discussion of just the hack between the contributors, artists, programmers, etc. You can find it in the list of furms on Arkonviox.com.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Welcome to the Ecco v1.5 private forum! Please post a topic for whatever project you plan to start on editing for the hack. Just so we're all clear, the goal of the hack is to make E2B as much like the Final Ecco 2 as possible, but still maintaining the Beta-ness. Once the hack is ready, we'll post it on the E2B Site for download. )

URF! *snicker-chuckles as Histronic* Omg. That's so sad. Oh btw Arkon, I've been gone for a while so I haven't gotten to see the updates so let me use now as a chance to say...wow. The main page looks awesome! o__o

Here's the final sprite modified to fit the Level 7/8 Crab on string/Eel/Barrier palette. The mobile ones still flash back to crabs every now and then, but the stationary ones use only this frame. Get it here.

K, i have 6 requests to do. I'll except 1 more then i then you cannot make an avatar requests till thier done. I limit face pics to7 becuz there are 7 days in a week and i usually do one a day beuz if i do a second one it wont be as good. So one more then th bills closed till they're finished.So far, we have: Arteus, Noriko, Lizza, Alastor, Neo Ecco and Kitnee.

Hehe, we could put sprites of the peoples characters around here to give Ecco a shove on his quest... a nsty one &gt;) There is one level that has it, I just can't remember its debug number... *goes to play emulation* As for emulators, when I ran windows - I used Dgen. There is a way to fix the sound - its hard though, you have to press esc. alot until you get that clear "dump!" noise that it has for menus. Seening as I'm on a mac now - I use 3 emulators to explore the games. I usually use the mac port of Dgen - which is really nice and friendly, on OS 9.2 it runs Ecco with the speed the original cart has. Like playing on the Mega Drive again :D. I also use Generator - rip .gym files with that because it plays the sound just right, however its been on the fritz recently, and MacMESS. MacMESS is a multi-emu, it doesn't play at the desired speed *as in its not as smooth* but there is ero faults in the music. Eccos charge soundeffect however gets muddled up. Its odd how emulators work ._.

As I can remember, in 1997 the only ecco websites I remember are sites on the line of "buy ecco cartridge for 19$" "ecco cheats here" and that cursed ecco shoes...A few weeks later I searched again and I found Undercaves.

Perhaps any old member of that community in this board?Noriko, there's a nice song from a band called "The Cure" with the same name of your signature. Is that a coincidence?

orignal eao's story waseao is a decendant of Ecco, she loved hearing stories of her heroic ancestor but sadend to hear of his abrupt dissaperance.She set off in the footseps of ecco's journey to seek out infomation on him, a beluga whale (forgot his name) and a Narwal have the big blues anchent wisdom and share it with her, she not only knows now of Asterite but of 'the mother pearl" (a thing i drempt of when I was 12) a giant globe of kowlege and power...the asterite is lonly and seeking her comaionship...for she is one of his kind (a fanfiction atripute I added to her).The time machine was broken by somone/thing and scatterd...because it is the only way to save the world from being screwed up..so the asterite tells her to rebuild it and find her ecco.Eao also gets indowned by the metashpere, borrowing the land floping ablity of the seal, strength of the orca and the small slimy nature of the aquatic salmander to brave the mini seas of northeasren ponds (to find a fresh water mini version of big blue...a turtle prehaps) to seek answers of the pearl!and yadda yadda, in the past eao fights the vortex queen who's holding ecco hostage, and then there is somthing with mermaids having evolved from somthing.then end!

Callyfin) Please go to the Ecco 1.5 board listed with the others and post what you intend to work on first. We could use someone to replace Ecco's sprites with the new, 3d-styled ones, replace the Asterite's sprites w/ new ones, etc.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Very cool .. can you make the nonstationary ones, and the chains/strings they're on look like the final, too? How about you make all your graphical changes into one big IPS patch, Callyfin can make changes to the ROM in another IPS patch, and I'll make my changes to the code in one. Then we patch all three together onto one ROM and make one "master patch".That sound good?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This is how I propose we make the final hack. Each of us makes our own modifications, not changing anything anyone else is working on. Each contributor makes their own IPS patch for the Beta ROM. Then, when your IPS patch is ready, you'll e-mail it to me at epicenter@adelphia.net, and I'll combine all the IPS patches onto one ROM and make one Master Patch and possibly a pre-patched ROM, which we can then post on the E2B Site.How does that sound?

The question becomes for me, how to implement version control so that nobody attempts to patch the same offsets. Perhaps since this is such a small devel group, people or teams can state what range of offsets they're modifying, and stating those as "checked out" of the code library.

Forgive me if I sound stupid or whatever, but heelp! ^^;; I hex edited my Ecco 2 beta (just screwing around with it, editing messages and what not), and I tried to load my work and it didn't run! O_o; What am I doing wrong and/or not doing?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, we're each working on a different part, so no problems SHOULD arise. If they do we'll work something out. :) Good idea.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You need to be sure not to EVER delete a byte or insert a new one, only overwrite. Hit INS on your keyboard (insert) to go to Overwrite mode. Just type OVER the current messages and leave line breaks (boxes in ASCII, 00 or 0A in hex), in place. That way the lines break properly on their own. Just align the spaces so they stay centered. )Good luck!

It didn't work for me.I didn't turn into a shark and the mother whale was too fast for me to talk to her 7 times. I think it's just a load of crap that people make up to get you to play the game. :x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
No luck here. First of all, you can't even talk to the mother 7 times, only twice. The whole "fish invincibility" was a load of crap, too. This person, whoever it was who made up this stuff, has a love of the number 7. And Ecco just turned, looked at me and squeaked. O_O;; I left him alone and he turned to me and whistled.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, I do. ^_^ I'll scan that Ecco Jr. ad, and I'll be sure to lscan anything else I find!

Sweetness. ^^ *goes back to looking through her old mags* Hey, an ad for the newest SNES game, Chrono Trigger. XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
 tell me about it. I waited forever to turn into a shark. All ecco did was turn in a circle. When I tried to talk to the whale it took off and by the time I even got to talk to her 3 times,I was in Perils of the coral reef.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah,I went and looked.Pretty intresting stuff.I will most certainly be checking that out the next time I play.

I'm trying to read the French version of Startide Rising  by David Brin; Marée Stellaire.But it's a difficult book, so I can't read more than 2 or 3 pages...I also tried to read the first tome of Dune by Franck Herbert, after I saw (and liked !) the film. It's a difficult book too, but I've seen the film before, so it was a few easier. Unfortunately, I stopped reading it...I'll be obliged to read a second time the beginning...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Any time several cheats together include stuff 'do this X times, then that X times' They become less and less likely to be true. My guess it's so if you complain to the webmaster they can just say 'oh, you didn't do it enough times' And the achilles heel for this sitesplat:

Dammit, dammit, and more dammit. &gt;_&lt; I found my stash of Video Games magazines. But I'm missing one. Just one. And that one happens to be the one where I saw the Ecco Jr. ad. I looked through each and every one of my others, but couldn't find it (I did come across a very very small spot that mentioned the game, and had the wrong pic for it - it had a Knuckles Chaotix pic O.o). I know the mag's around somewhere...I just don't know where. I'm going to keep looking, though.Those mags are great - had all sorts of old info and rumors. Like how Nintendo 64 was originally going to be named Ultra 64. And how SEGA was going to make the Eclipse, a Saturn add-on. Very neat mags!

I am stuck now on the Anguish of Dearth/entrapment level. i just keep going back and forth between the 2 levels and cant seem to get out. I am going to try starting them over and see if i cant complete them correctly.Well, once you beat entrapment, you go back to Anguish of Dearth. Beat all the sharks there (I think you need to) Find a dolphin hiding in a hut. It shows up as yellow on sonar. It will open a hole that leads to Caverns of Hope.

I think I have an idea... Time Decrement changes the time it takes for the "Air Meter" to go down. When you get a ring that goes into the corner, it replenishes that meter. I think the Difficulty affects whether the rings move or not. 0 makes none move, 3 makes nearly all of them move.
</div>

Oddly enough, I don't think I've been to Quebec. Even though my state borders it and I've gone further. So maybe someday....Anyway, enjoy your trip Lizza.

You know, if you want a final version of the 'magic arm' to replace a crab on a string, there is one in the level Atlantis on the final, in the room that has the glyph blocking the way to the exit.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Here's what I'm working on, and my progress on each thing Done, except for a palette for level 0-Sonar Map colors 50% done. Somebody making a sprite which is 48x24 pixels and horizontally symmetric would help.-Ecco's sprites Done, but not the best. May redo later.I may fix Ecco's palette for City of Forever, depending on being able to change the yellow pillars, blocks, etc.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
There are a bunch in the Atlantis levels and the Vortex Future ones. Unfortunately, they use a different palette of 16 colors from the crabs on strings from the Beta.I may not change the strings. They fit quite well as-is. Besides, the Beta has more styles than the Final, and I'd prefer to keep it that way. Also, for the nonstationary ones, a sprite that fits the 48x24 horizontally symmetric size of the other crab sprite would help, if someone could make one. I'd make it, but I'm not a very good sprite artist, as shown by the *ahem* beautiful toasters in my other hack.

What do you mean Tracks? Music Tracks? I'm afraid we couldn't do that, the Genesis does not support the CD tracks like the SegaCD/MegaCD does. I suppose you could join if you have some good ideas to share. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Kool, sounds great! Is this sprite you want made for the Magic Arm's chain/string/etc., or something else? If you can fix the red bubbles in the 3D Swimming stages, that'd be good, too. (you see them when you charge.)  Is it possible for you to put Ecco's new sprites from the final in to replace the old ones?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It just occurred to me why the GG/MasterSystem version of Ecco 2 calls those stages "DDD Swimming'" .. it meant "3 D's", or "3D"! 3D Swimiming! I didn't figure it out until now. But why would they not just put 3D?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I need the actual critter. The final sprite is 1 frame and is the wrong size for the second crab frame. 3D swimming palettes won't be too hard. Ideally, I'll be able to make it have actual algae too, from the final. I'll do the Ecco sprites sometime.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Interstingly enough, you can play music from Ecco 1 in the beta. It works how you can turn off the music in Ecco 1 final - just pause the game and press A. Not all of the music tracks are there, I think, although they may be. You can play the old songs in the debug menu, too, just like in the final versions.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm going to try and hack anything I can to make it look more final. First and foremost I'm going to)- Change the Asterite's message.Anything else I can find to modify (I anticipate finding much more), I will attempt to make more final-ish. )

If you can send me the sprite from the Final, I can make it into a 48x24 sprite for you pretty easily.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Here's one. It has to be symmetric horizontally, so I only bothered with one side. The green is the background, if you couldn't tell.http://members.cox.net/tails151/magicarmbody.gif
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
OK, I sent you the new sprite, 48x24, in BMP format. Maybe 50k at the most. It's stretched out to the size of a crab, but if you want me to make it square and proportional, I can do that too. Just let me know and I'll send you a new one. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yea, there was a big discussion about this on the old board before it came to Arkonviox.com. I hadn't checked out the other songs in the debug yet though .. I'll have to do that :) Thanks!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Awesome! ... I wish I had mags like those :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, I'm back!  mrgreen:I actually -did- get that plushie, but it's pretty small, only about 5 inches long I'd say.  I wanted to get an orca but there weren't any small ones, at least not that weren't a bean big or didn't look stupid, and the decent ones were too big and too expensive.  And the only dolphins were the small ones.I don't have a lot of time so I won't be posting anything else for now, I got to this kinda late.  But I do have time to tell everyone a little bit about my trip, just the important parts.First of all I had a great time!  The scenery was gorgeous!  On the wildlife tour in Denali we saw a bear, a moose, and a wolf, and we also saw some Dall sheep (they look kinda like bighorns) and caribou but those were just little dots.  I saw one caribou's antlers thru some binoculars someone lent me, but it was still blurry.  Also we saw a moose run by the train back to Anchorage and I saw 3 or 4 bald eagles throughout the whole trip.  Both the moose were female.  But what we didn't see was Mt.McKinley, and we discovered only about 20% of tourists actually see it because its covered in clouds all the time.  The best part was the boat tour in the Kenai Fjords.  We got to see a big glacier and witnessed some big chunks coming off of it (I think they called it "calving" or something, but isn't that the term used for when a cow gives birth?) and it sounded like thunder.  But that wasn't the cool part.  Almost right away we saw a humpback, and we saw a tail-dive.  Then while it was still around a pod of Dall's porpoises appeared and swam around the boat, they were right next to the boat!  And then we saw a pod of orcas not long afterward.  On the way back we witnessed a humpback gulping a bait ball (a tight group of fish)--the guy said they normally come straight up, and this one just kinda rolled instead, but it was still cool.  And then we saw a mother and baby whale.  We also saw a couple groups of Stellar sea lions and lots of sea birds, including two kinds of puffins and some birds that looked like penguins that fly (and, of course, seagulls).So even tho it was cloudy everywhere except for Anchorage (no matter what it was like elsewhere it was always sunny and warm in Anchorage while we were there) and it rained in Denali, I still had a really good time.  I would love to go back sometime.Well, I know I've missed a lot while I was gone and so I'm not gonna even TRY to catch up.  It takes me a whole week to catch up after being gone a weekend, and with as long as I've been gone this time I know I'll never be able to do it.Well it's time for me to go to bed.  But don't worry, I'll be back tomarrow.  Unless I can't for some reason.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks. I've got it put in now. The way I made it, it fits best in levels 7 and 8, looks okay in 15, but looks kinda weird in 3. That last bit is forgivable, though, seeing how the crab that was there before looked kinda weird.

<div id='container'>
I thought you were lookign for ecco 2 beta stuff O_oHere i have a mag ad for ecco 1 on gamegear
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
music?  what does it take midis?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i need to make emotercionshmmm fake cheets shuk
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
are you going to use the ecco 2 sprites or the ecco 1 sprites for dolphins?the beta has the sprite for 1 and the colors for 2...(those dolphins are almost purple Purple!)hm..unless we you...somone could recolor the ecco2 'phins grey..I duno..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
mabye I could edit sprites...?but I won't know how to add them.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
when hacking the rom and or just playing with it what exactly are we serching for?oh when the Vortex queen fallls, pressing A button and start will bring you to the level where the vorxet drone will grab you.also, the messages do not work....if you try to use them the screen will remain with that background and the dolphins will be whiteish-purpley blue.also in the level where you can swim through the rocks, when you do this at one dept level ecco will be gold!eh...is that relevent to anything?so what could I do to help...or what should I look for?  As I said I'm not good at hexing..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I guess I could always make bulk advitars for the confussed and character-less people

<br />

<div id='container'>
arse is like ass, but in an Irish accent or somthing.....celtic ass.....I'm waiting for my User name's confermation e-mail for overclocked's phpbb, so I can request ecco remixes..I'm thinking of a gosple/soul version of when your pod gets stolen a discoish-dance version of the music that plays in ToT with the medussaa hiphopish street rap version of the music in Cystal springsa classic rock version of the music in 'Tressure caves" from ecco jrany ideas?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hahaha! Thats good Lizza. This is what we do to fake cheats and they're creators however...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it's not ecco.com from 96'and it's not stars or SOEnot Delphinus what we need if a master hacker!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I hate to have to point out the obvious, but duh.  No game has cheats that cool.  Especially not Ecco.  The game is how many years old and now you find these cheats?  Plus, why the hell would you even consider doing anything that person said after demonstrating they learned how to write english by reading cereal boxes?  The writing was so poor he may have been telling us how to make a peanutbutter and cheese sandwich.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What we need is to stop giving a rat's ass.  The site was probably some faggot angelfire page featuring cheats and and probably said *LOLZ* every four words.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Holy shit eao O_o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
thats very interesting eao. it makes me think that i need to get codes up for the beta. the rest i leave to epicenters kick ass site!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I created some new ranks for your Globe members. and special ones for those of you in both globes and earth clan.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You could edit them, make them the proper size, and send them to Tails151 and he could insert them into the game. If that's OK with him, anyway ..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tails151 plans to change Ecco/Dolphins' sprites to the new Ecco 2 ones.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Nah, there's specially-formatted music in the ROM somewhere. I don't know the format, though, but I'm sure it's not MIDI. Probably FM Synthesizer instructions of some sort.Thanks for the new ranks, Arkon! :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A good way to hack is to make a backup copy of your ROM, then hack one copy. Change some bytes, and see if anything noticable happens. Tweak the portion once you know what it does and try to discover how it works, what format it uses, etc. until you can effectively change something. If you mess up, you can always open your backed-up ROM. I personally like I keep the ecco2beta.zip file onhand to create a clean ROM whenever I need to.Remember: 00 and FF tend to be OFF and ON respectively, so you probably don't want to change those to anything else, say, 43, 1B, etc.We knew about the A+Start trick from someone else (though I forget who), it's probably so people demonstrating the game at, say, E3, could show off a level very, very quickly, and without using the debug. Same for "globe holder". Also note that the Vortex Drones (there's an unlimited amount) in that level can shoot damaging bubbles at you. They do NOT do this in tie final. However, in the Final, when Ecco turns into a drone with a Metasphere, he can do this attack. But the game-controlled ones cannot.Let us know if you find anything cool to hack in the ROM!

Heh, too bad the Ecco games for GG were complete disasters compared to the Genesis versions. :)

This thread is for posting all the Ecco ads you find! I found two so far (still can't find my Ecco Jr. one u.u) - one for ToT and the other for DoF. WARNING -  PICTURES ARE BIG!DoF Ad from the back of Space Channel 5 manualToT ad from the back of Sonic and Knuckles manual
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Great ideas, Eao!! Maybe a techno remix of Asterite's Home song from ToT? You know, the happy music that suddenly turns dramatic after a while? Anyway, the song you hear when you press A on sound track 12 in ToT's debug menu. o.o;;;;;;;

I guess I was the one with the idea to make a time line of the ecco community...seeing as how some of us came from the undercaves...then came this place...then cOH and the website wars...the artists and inovators who flocked through....

ok, yesh I know this is a repeate...or recap on the subject but that font creator is annoying as talking poop!I hate vector drawing....and importing images is no picnic either.so if you have the program, do you wish to take off where I was in....which isn't much, what you'll down load are indivudal images of the letters in ecco, and a pcx file of the password screen to take and warp letters to form lowercase and numbers, symbols and such.good luckhttp//www.geocities.com/leoroster/e2b.zip  pcx files of weird things in ecco 2 beta...mainly Mina and Alastor's 'apperances'

the site existed pre 1998 then closed down for good. the person who told me abut this site said it was as big as this site. (although i think thats bullslip) the only way i can see what it once looked like is using archives.org.imagine if we found that place. i heard they descovered things we never have. but...maybe hist is right. i just brought it up to see if i'd get any luck.

because i dont have as much freetime as i used to anymore.

thanks aster, I get the same feeling about you when I look at your avatar. =)(I leave on sunday on a side note. =) ) Plenty of time to play tides of time again. wooo, its been way too long, and I forgot how incredibly annoying those stupid dolphins are. :P

We're probably keeping them, but changing their sprites to final Magic Arm sprites. Sorry ;) I don't know how to remove 'em yet. But I can try.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XVI and Hex Workshop both work very well, but Hex Workshop costs $.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Do you suppose you could send me a current IPS patch with what you have so far? (the new asterite sprites, fixed Time Machine pallette, and new Magic Arm)?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Did you happen to pass that big wall COVERED in signs? I thought that was pretty cool. You go there and put up a licence plate, or some kind of sign of your own. Some people put up playground zone signs and stuff too. o_O;Nope, didn't see anything like that.  Is that in Anchorage?  It's such a big city even tho it looks more like a small city, and we didn't have our own transportation so we couldn't go far.  We were on a "custom tour" so everything was all laid out for us including transportation to each place we had to go, but we couldn't go anywhere on our own that was out of walking distance.Oh, and this is the avatar Fargal made for me. Thanks Fargal! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
8O What...happened...here?? @.@;Wow, maybe this place just needs me around to keep things a bit more in order, just looked at what happened while I was gone.  x.x;;

<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh! Um...Subway...I guess...cuz they got vegetarian subs too...:: o.x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, if anyone wants it to see what I've done, it's here. I figured since you wanted it, I might as well put it up for everyone. It won't hurt anything. Oh, the red bubbles aren't fixed yet, but I've replaced one of Ecco's sprites.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I never got an actual explanation as to why I'm here, even tho I asked a few times.  I just figure it's because Arkon likes me so much.  DOh, and happy much-belated-Birthday Kitnee!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That would work fine. If I need something done, I'll post the current sprite in the desired palette, and if you could make the new one using the same colors, it would be great.
</div>

<div id='container'>
shut the hell up hist before i beat you with a fetus.

<div id='container'>
I don't know about the Marble Sea thing, but in the Genesis version in....ummm....that level where you meet Trellia and the dolphins are jumping around in the beginning saying they felt the Asterite die or whatever...in that level, sometimes the sky turns red and I think the other colors of just the stuff above the water is messed up but everything else is fine.  It just does it every once in a while and if you dive under where you can't see the sky and then come back up it goes back to normal.

What did i say about pedaling yer warez in my request topic? Do it again and ill edit yer avatar so its only half there.

I almost plum forgot about that avatar while I was in Alaska.  But I remembered when I found it in my e-mail when I got back.  I already told you it looked good, and then AFTER that I compared it with the picture which you based it off and realized there's a few tiny details that are a bit off.  But I don't care.  It still looks cool.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That avatar i made for you was easy to make, a little to easy. But if its what ya want, no problemo. :DDont dissapear on us, or i'll look for you the rest of my life. And if i dont find you, i'll kill your incarnation, so forth.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I woulda said welcome back sooner, but I hadn't been around for a while and then I went to Alaska and I just got back on Wednesday and didn't feel like getting on the computer.So, Welcome Back! Even if it is late.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I already saw that in the fanfare.  When I came back from my trip I decided I better look to see what fanart was added while I was gone, and it was a lot.  Anyway, this picture is really good, I'm quite impressed.  And I agree it would look good colored.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Those are both incredible.  Keep up the good work!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've seen all of these already, but I like looking at them.  Those are amazing.  The third picture reminds me of Jessica deAlkirk from Lunar mostly because of the outift.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm....well....I'd write a huge bio' about my chara', but that'd take forever and it's late. X3 I'll just say, visit my site//www.geocities.com/blackfox71/index.htmHere's a link to the fiction section//www.geocities.com/blackfox71/new_page3.htmI regret that I haven't been able to update it in ages, but since the pc changeover and my loss of my FrontPage in which the site's data was stored~ I haven't been able to update at all.... not even the artwork has been updated~ which is killing me since I have so many new pic's I'd like to add. ~_~;;

<div id='container'>
All of your drawings are really good.  Those are beautiful!  I love how Arkon looks, but they all look really cool.Are you planning on drawing me? You know nobody has drawn any of my characters except for the two avatars that Fargal's done for me.But it doesn't really matter.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
As usual, the site doesn't work with me...GRRR !!!Just copy and paste the address, Sten.Anyway, it looks beautiful.  I've never played any FF game except for FFVII which I rented once and didn't get far in.  But I still like the picture, it looks great.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Looks good DT! I could never draw comics like that.  I've tried drawing comics and failed miserably.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Those look pretty cool, altho the second one is kinda blurry.I would never want to do anything like that myself.  But it's cool that you're doing it.

*hands Crestoe a switchblade again*

<div id='container'>
I've started on a picture of all four of my Ocean Gaurdians.  It will take a while.  I'm not used to drawing pictures with more than one character and even less with more than two.  I'm actually almost done with the basic drawing but it's already taken longer than a simple portrait drawing.  And I'm planning on CGing it in Photoshop and I have no idea how long that will take.  But I want to try to make it as good as I can so it will probably take a while.I don't really want to place an unfinished picture on my site or on Side 7, otherwise I'd post it here because the only way to do that is to put it up somewhere else first.It's not the easiest thing I've done.  Fitting them all on one page means I have to draw them smaller than what I'm used to, and that makes Salacia and Alignak particularly small.  The thing about that is it makes it more difficult to draw detail on them.  So far I'm pulling it off pretty well, but the coloring will be a challange and I don't know if I can make it look the way I want.Wish me luck.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
man you guys are fucked up. poor eao @_@
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds like it should be pretty interesting to see.One day maybe I'll draw pictures of my many many characters. That  could take longer than your project.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
=) Whatever floats your boat!(as you can see, I'm shoving in as many posts as humanly possible before I go)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
OK - a few things. First off are these little screen shots from when I was messing around with my ToT ROM. Kinda the same thing like Sten's tidbit in the "Interesting Things" section, only with THEPOD.1234Next are comparison shots of two different Vortex hatchlings. The first is the "normal" hatchling - the one that Ecco turns into, the one that carries him away if you get to close.  The second one is of a Vortex hatchling from New Machine. As you can see, they are different in the face, body. Now take a look at the Vortex-thing sprite (from the beta; sprite from E2B site) and look closely at the first Vortex hatchling - don't their faces look similar? Also, the Vortex hatchling's tail and the Vortex-thing's spike resemble each other. Could the Vortex-thing actually be a prototype for the Vortex hatchlings?Hatchling 1Hatchling 2Vortex-thingAnother thing I found (sorry, went too fast for me to make a screenshot, and I had just noticed this as it was changing), was in Moray Abyss, when the Asterite's globes pop out of the conch. One of the globes turned into the beta's water bubble sprite!!! I'm kicking myself now that I wasn't fast enough to take a shot of it. X_xI'll shut up now. I promise. XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, that's happened to me before, too!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh heh, thanks, Teth! *hugglies*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've got a rather simple explanation for the differing sprites: The regular one is fully grown, the New Machine one is just an infant (Or whatever you want to call it). I don't see much of a resemblance to the tail, but you do have an interesting theory.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah come on! I'm they weren't that bad Teth! But then... you always think your own stuff is crap. And that brings me to another anouncment!!!I'm going to strat from square one on this project again. When I started this, it really had no plan, and made no sence... so now I'm bringing it back to start. Each characters age is being bumped up one year, and a little more background will has been created for them so this whole thing isn't just free falling.As for the comic... those two I've done are being trashed. I know, I know, sorry, but I just hate them so much, I can't keep em around. And it's not the drawing or the coloring that I don't like, it's the scripting and the (non) story. Like I said, I've developed some background for them, a strating spot, and a path (kind of). The whole thing is generally going to (hopfully) take a turn for the better now!I'm going to script out the first episode, and really try to bring out their characters (and keep it interesting). This'll prolly take me a while, and there's no way now, that I'll be finishing five comics end this summer. Uhhhh.... anyways... I've already rambled to much, and I doubt any of you know what I'm trying to say, but.... well you'll see when I get the damn comic out! ^_^

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh yEAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! W00t! For FFVIII art! I'm love'n it! The second one of Selphie is totally amazing! I love the whole idea, and the shading is beautiful! There all damn fine!It's too bad I'm not updating FFSCOPE anymore, because those would have been nice additions to my fanart section. And I think I probably would have given you my FF Fanart Award of Greatness for that one of Sephy, cause it totally rocks!!!You know I'm always dieing to see more! Keep it up!!!

<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah Eao, was that you who cut it in half there? I was wondering about that. But I really love the nice one you got now! Very purdy.

You know what the sickest part about it all is... is that I actually know what some of the stuff they're talking about means. @_@ I've been in math wayyyyyyyyyy too long. Damn summer school... it's fring my brain.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Awesome! The new Ecco sprite looks great, only the pallette may be a bit off (he seems to have more colors in the final), but it's no big problem. The new Magic Arms look awesome! )BTW, do you have an AIM screen name?

I'll miss everyone while I'm gone. If I went to Quebec,I probobly wouldn't be able to understand most of the people. I see why sten would go there! I'd like to learn hoe to speak french,but if I take one more french class,I'll pop! I really love Quebec for loads of reasons. One of them is that I love Quebecer accentD A other is the differences between French spoken in France and in Quebec: there are a lot of words from English, and from a very ancient French.For example, the word used in France for "car" is "voiture". In Quebec, it's possible to use the term "char", who is the name of the ancient car with horses. Do you understand ?In France, we use "blague" to say "joke". In Quebec, the people use the term "joke", like in English.I like it !_!

What is "The Globes" ? Is it a new clan ?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The Asterite's done. The sprites are similar, but not quite the same. The final version has it just shrink back into the background, but the Beta has an actual different sprite for when going back.Ecco's final sprite has the same amount of colors as the beta. They're just slightly different, and if you use the Beta TLP palette for the final, it'll work fine. And yes, the other Ecco sprites will be done.No, I don't have AIM.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Those are awesome! I especially love the last one, but for some reason it looks awfully familiar.  They're all really good.Sten, just copy the addresses and then paste them into the little bar-thingy where you normally type in addresses.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've noticed a lot of people now have great looking new avatars, many of which seem to have been made by Crestoe.  But Fargal made mine and I like it.But that's not the topic here.

The way I see it, the Vortex are like insects, kinda. It would be like this Expendable. Perimeter defense, workers, etc.Females/Young Queens/??? Attempt at a robotic guard. Was tested against dolphins. It failed.Machine/New Machine Feeds, reproduces. Can become a Larva for defense and escape.Larva: May become either of the other forms except the robot. Hung around the City of Forever for reasons unknown.This would also make some sense, considering the Vortex are the predecessors of arthropods, exopods, etc.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was fiddling with Levels 4 and 5, and found something very interesting. If you get the dolphin who says "COME WITH ME ... I KNOW WHERE IS THE CAVE" to lead you to the area with the downward current, and swim up it, you will reach a little area closed off by an island. On the left is a rock wall. Jump up into the air and you will go to a 3D Swimming level! This may not sound too strange, but here's why it's odd Fixed inaccurate information and made subject accurate as well, added some stuff.

Alrighty .. looks awesome so far! How long do you think it'll take to add the new Ecco sprites? BTW, if you get AIM, we can talk to eachother about the hack instantly, that's easier than talking on the board //www.aim.com, and my screen name is Epicenter713.

Alright folks, here's the lineart for your viewing pleasure.http http://www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Archive.pl?ANO=1610But I haven't been able to get to my archive at all since yesterday so that's even less likely to work.

 Ow. My brain hurts.The only thing that made sense to me is that i is equal to the square root of -1, because I actually remember learning that in Advanced Algebra.  But all the other crap...is this somebody's idea of a cruel joke? Did they just make up all that?  o.o;

<div id='container'>
Quaternions are very much real, they're essentially 4th dimentional complex numbers.Most commonly used to escape undefined states in the eular axis system, such as when two axis become coplaner. This is sometimes called "gimbal lock"

Ah, summer.  When you have all the time in the world to hang out with your friends if they weren't all on vacation somewhere. o.o;Don't you just love the irony?Have a good time Al!  :Fade-color
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Try doing it in a copy that you HAVEN'T patched yet. The ring meter was something I did for Ecco 1.5. In the regular one, the Air Meter is still there. And I think the reason you get to it by jumping in the air is that the ring you go in wasn't done yet.EDIT: It works in Level 4, too. Try going further right so you aren't off the screen horizontally when it finishes scrolling.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Awesome stuff, Teth! You gonna CG or color 'em?

Noriko is the best anime drawer in the world ! When I think I'm not able to draw a normal human...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It's axes. That's the plural form of axis.See I actually know something!Even tho I didn't understand anything else you said. o.o4th dimensional numbers? Wow, so I guess we actually do know what the fourth dimension is.  I always figured it was time but it turns out the 4th dimension is actually math. x.o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You need to be a developer of Ecco v1.5. Ask Epicenter about the criteria to get in.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh I just thought of something.Shadow, it seems you know something about these quarantines or whatever you call them.  So tell me, when in life would someone possibly use something like that?  Is there some sort of career where that junk might actually come in handy, besides trying to teach it so you can make people's heads explode? Cuz I can't imagine any possible use for all that.  In fact, I can't imagine any time when you'd use any sort of imaginary numbers.  Except for teachers to drive students crazy.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I guess I'll have to go next.Anchorage.  Cuz it's a city and I was just there.  But it's nothing like Detroit or any other big city, it just looks like a small city but with a larger area and more people and a few tall buildings here and there, all of which were hotels.I hope you all know that Anchorage is in Alaska.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

I figured all of the vortex looked different becaus ethey wer elike termites or something, which have different body shapes depending on what they do.

And you know what amazed me the most?The entire fuckin STATE is sold on PEPSI!  The only time I had a Coke was on the boat in the Kenai Fjords.  They said it was all the had left or something.  Guess they were out of Pepsi.At first I thought it was just Anchorage.  At the restaurants we went to they had Pepsi, at the hotel cafe they had Pepsi and the vending machines had Pepsi.  But then  it was the same way in Denali, Seward, and Alyeska.  No Coke anywhere, except on the boat as I mentioned.  And you want to know what's even more amazing?  All the Pepsi and not a SINGLE Sierra Mist to be found anywhere!  Sierra Mist is the only Pepsi product that I like.But there were two non-Pepsi products that appeared, and many places either had one or the other (I don't think any place had both)--Dr. Pepper and 7-Up.  I do like Dr. Pepper, in fact lately it's what I drink most often.  7-Up is okay...I can stand 7-Up more than I can stand Pepsi.  So it wasn't so bad.But still, it's amazing you can go to a state and see only one Coke out of all the places you've been to.  Here Coke is more popular, but there's still plenty of Pepsi.  But in Alaska Coke has almost no presence. Of course that's just where we were at, but if you go to three cities and one resort (Alyeska isn't really a city, according to my dad, just a resort or something), and all they have is Pepsi everywhere you go, you get the feeling at least most of the state is like that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Awesome stuff, Teth! You gonna CG or color 'em?Yeah it'll be CGed.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It's a good picture, and the CG looks pretty good especially for a first try.  The highlights in their hair and on the pokeballs look good.  The one major thing you should do is add more shading and maybe even some more highlights like maybe on their boots and gloves or something.  But it looks good, Kitnee, keep it up!

<div id='container'>
Tethys, you're a genius !   Yeah I know!   I'm really modest, too.

How I see the vortex )Vortex Drone - Rage from Baby (new machine) to Matured (Lunar Bay). Arn't as powerful as other types, but have free passage into the Vortex Future. Vortex Guard - Evolved from the Drones - The difference in colour symbolizes the rank (Green, Brown, Blue - for ref. Ecco 2 = Blue, Ecco 1 = Green, and Jap Ecco 1 = Brown.).  Are highly powerful and deadly, but arn't well armoured, so are killed easily.Vortex Larva - A slow, hulking hatchling of the Vortex Kind, it is very powerful when it attacks, but its easilly outrun, or confused. They feed off the energy the queen brings them, and evolve into the fast, and smaller forms of the drones.Vortex Bot (E2B) - A mixed combination of Dolphins, Sharks, and Vortex Drones. Is fast, powerful, but has a weakspot - it can't match the speed of real dolphins.Vortex Machine - A great machine built to sustain the life of the vortex on the earth. Similar to their home planets great city - the machine is alive, and when a forine life form enters it, it does everyting to kill it. Vortex Queen - Only one is born every 2000 years. They evolve directly from the Larva into the hulking head mass, where they breed, and feed apon the life of other worlds. My sumary of the vortex o.o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah, I see ) I think, though, that this exit was derived from Ecco 1's "flying into the air" exit, as there's no one defined object you have to collide with to enter the 3D Swimming stage. Ecco 1 did indeed have an exit like that, but the scrolling worked properly and Ecco would be pulled off the top of the level and fall into the next level.The rings look great, keep up the good work :)

<br />

<div id='container'>
*poof*  (See signature for details.)

<div id='container'>
Ecco's sprites will take a while... There are a bunch of them in the Beta, and even more in the Final. Most are also a different size from the corresponding one in the other versio. I got lucky with the one I replaced, but I still had to take off part of his fin, and the dorsal fin is a short distance from where it should be...I have to fix that star for the time warps... I had stuck a tile in a blank space, but didn't clean up when I was done.I may get AIM sometime...

I dunno why I keep drawing FFVIII stuff lately. o_o But actually, that last one is kind of old. x_x Oh an Tethys, the reason it looks familiar to you is probly 'cuz it's a sketch I did of one of my friend's watercolour paintings. You've probably seen it on a site somewhere. ^__^ I continued my FFVIII drawing madness today, actually. With a drawing of Quistis. o_____o forgot to scan it though. She's wearing a cute little sundress and standing in a field of sunflowers. ^.^ Maybe if I'm not too lazy I'll scan it tomorrow....heh. But I never know if I'm lazy or not until I wake up in the morning. So I guess we'll just see. o__o

Well, you don't have to be able to do graphics AND hacking AND sound, just some aspect of modifying ROMs. You can learn by experimentation (to hack the ROM), using some info from the Hacking the ROM section. You'll need a good Hex Editor to do this. To learn how to do sprite editing, you can use Tile Layer Pro and a pallette file (you can get Tile Layer Pro off the net, and Tails151 and I have the pallette if you want to try that out. I know next to nothing about editing the sounds, though, you're on your own there. :)Someone here might be willing to help you out. I can help you with hex editing and hacking, but the best advice I can give for that is to experiement and find out what all the parts of the ROM do, then try to change them in a logical fashion so you can make the game work to your liking.

Eoraptor,Sure! You can help out Tails151-- he can give you the palletized image, you can edit it and make a new sprite for it, and then give it to him, and he can insert it into the ROM. Does that sound good?

A quick search of the board would gives this bit of info:Heheheh...the two levels, Passage from Genesis and Pathways from Nowhere...were most certainly not taken out of the game! Who ever decided to state that they were, should've done more of their homework...ehem! They definitely become playable in the PS2 version! In order to unlock those levels however, you must complete the entire game first. Once you've done that...go take a look at the Level Select screen. Notice anything different about the level Up and Down's tiny oval picture when that level is highlighted...? You should automatically notice sparkles all over it...as if to be calling to you "play me again!" It is only after beating the game that the things necessary to get to those levels will be revealed. All the sudden the rock to follow down to the entrance of Passage from Genesis has appeared and can be used to do so! Same with the ring and the crystals to be brought to it in the area where the geyser drops you off at. They appear and allow you to access Pathways from Nowhere! So...do not fret Prime Mover...you still can play those awesome levels that take you "back in the days"...

Crestoe has made this post as the result of a converstaion him and i had.  The subject?DONT MAKE FUCKING USELESS POSTS.  This is an example of one such useless post.  And judgng by the fact that Noriko here didnt even flinch, its becoming all too common.  In case you dont know what stupid is, i made a handy little guide.If its about the color of sailor moons panties, dont post it.  If it's as stupid or more stupid, or 5% less stupid, also dont post it.This has been a public service announcement from Histronic.  Consider this fair warning for when I bust through your wall and strangle you with your mouse cord next time you make a dumbass post.

<div id='container'>
do it and i will beat you both with featuses o_o

<div id='container'>
Hrm. Well, considering that this particular forum is for "offtopic/other" posts, aren't ALL the topics here useless? So I don't understand why you're getting all huffy. It's not like dumb and useless posts are uncommon. *shrug* But if you want to play vigilante and try and stop them from appearing...I guess you can try. But ya don't have to be rude about it. o_o Sheez.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Why fetuses? o.o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well this topic WAS originally in the General forum as a public service announcement but Dolphin moved it because he's in a relationship with a linux program.But basicly, he's essentially talking about posting useless topics everywhere.

<div id='container'>
Thats pretty much the less offensive version of what i was going to say.

I see. Some day. It will be completed. But...don't those wise old warriors in the movies always call their students "Grasshopper"? Unless I'm sadly mistaken. &gt;_&gt;

hey Sten...I've noticed you're having some problems with Geocities.  = Is it fixed now? Well, duh, obviously you saw the pics, but I was just wondering. Heh.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, you are mistaken.On that faithful day in April 16 years ago, i made a commitment to make you a stone. Althought your training is slow and disoriented, i will make you my honorary aprentice "Meat Head".  As you progress, your rank will go from there to "Alastor Wannabe", And so forth.Its a long harsh road, but im have faith in you my "Meat Head" Whether you choose to except you desitiny or not.If you dont, you get your 15 dollar cash refund at the counter. Doing so will in turn make me take a sword to my eye, for that is the tradition of a lost aprentice. o_o

o_o I see...wait. No, I lied. I don't quite see. "Meat Head", eh? lol. Very un-flattering (if that's a word), but it will do.  And please, do not take a sword to your eye, for it would be very messy, and I would have to clean it up.

Wow, crazy seeing all you guys as you look in real life. Mostly I say things like "Oh, Dolphingirl... that's the blue dolphin with the sparkly background!" "Kitnee, that's the killer whale!" Well, now I guess I have faces to put to the names!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol! I know what you mean. Plus, it's kind of confusing when you have to associate like...a bunch of people with dolphins. o_o 'Cuz almost everyone here's character is a dolphin...with some original traits and things that they added. But still. It gets confusing. Like, for the longest time I kept mixing Artreus and Phosis up. o____o;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Um. Would you guys smack me if I asked what SPAO was? x_o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ACK! Okay, well, most of you know how I was working on a pic of everyone from the forums...and yea. I was working really hard on it. I had Cally, Artreus, Lizza, Myself, Arkon, Phosis, Crestoe and Eao all drawn in there. I even had individual sketches I had made of everybody. And I mean EVERYBODY.  But I just went into my room and I found out that my cat had jumped on my dresser and knocked over my waterbottle. I don't know when it happened, but it was one of those really big waterbottles...and it's all empty now! It had been dripping water all over my sketchbook for...who knows how long!! Now all my pictures are blurry. You can't even make anything out anymore.  :?  Now what am I supposed to do? (Besides murder Chloe?) My sketchbook was one of those with the paper covers.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*grins and playfully baps you* Hehe, Silly Noriko :DSPAO is the Sketchbook Pass-around organization. All those whom are participating in it have sent they're sketchbooks around the world where those whom are in it all contribute a few drawings to the book - so that when the original owners of the respected books get them back, they all have art in it from those whom participated. Fun, no?

<br />

<div id='container'>
"I will krush you like the little SeeDs you are!" Hehehe D Shes pretty cool, for an evil sorceress.

<div id='container'>
*pretend cries, peeking through her fingers to see Cally's reaction* Woah! What a spiffy idea! Wo when you get your book back, you have little memories of everybody. Teehee. Alright, that answers my question. Heh. Thanks. Now I'm not so lost.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yea! Why is it the evil ones always turn out to be the coolest? o___o Wait. I take that back. *Likes Selphie the best* but still. I think you know what I mean. ?  All my others are filled.

heh i hope i can add those tonight depens on how much the postnuke to html engine im gonna use works.i have one thing i need to say. that wierd shark/dolphin thing. I'm absolutly sure it was suppose to be a dolphin of the vortex future kinda like trellia but opposite future. I think they removed it cause it didnt have any significance to the story besides showing you what a dolphin of the vortex future would look like. that and too many people confuse it with a shark.I suggest someone ask ed annuziatta ecco's creator about this. email him at ed@andnow.com or maybe .net can't remember

You should be able to take a corner at nearly any speed provided that you turn the wheels more or use acceleration to kneel the car over. Eventually you'll find the corner speed for the vehicle, where you get the most turning rate (different than below cornerspeed, which decreases radius at the expense of rate)

This may sound weird,but I always had a fetish for the old Genisis box art and ads.I truely miss box art.Most game boxes today are simple,and often in-game photos or something like that. I always get a chill up my spine whenever I see that TOT ad,why I have no idea.It's just the lettering against a dark backround,with "For Sega Genesis" below.But I freaking LOVE it. It leaves so much to the imagination.I also love the ad for Sonic &amp; Knuckles at the back of TOT's instuction booklet.Sometimes,simplicity is best.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Awesome Teth!!! I love those characters! I think they're all really cool and original. Nice style too. Can't wait to see it when it's done! But Kit's right about that... takes my weeks to do a damn picture. :b And I still can't seem to find that "make cool" button.

I use two hex editors. One is called XVI, which I use whenever I am running Windows. I used to use Hex Workshop, but it turns out it expires and can only save files up to 512k. Or that might be WinHex. Anyway, it was giving me trouble, so I decided to go with XVI. XVI is free, and works great. It breaks the bytes (2 hexadecimal alphanumerics) into little boxes. That's the hex editor I used for the screenshots in the Ecco 1 Connection section in the About the Rom section of the E2B site. The only problem with it is that if you scroll with the scrollbars, the hex code won't refresh until you stop scrolling.The other is Ghex for Linux. It's available as a package with Debian Linux. The only bad thing about it is that it shows the 00 and 0A line breaks in E2B Text as commas. Not too convenient, but you get used to it pretty quickly, so long as you don't use commas in your messages, that is. :)

Webt and seen Deep Purple, Scorpions and Dio and they were all freak'n awesome. The Green Day concert rocked too! Blink 182 played also. Green Day at the Pop Disaster Tour were just awesome. Billie Joe had some guys come up there and play the drums, bass, and guitar. The guy who was playing the guitar got to keep it and ran off stage with it screaming! The only thing that sucked was we had lawn seats. I was hoping to catch a drumming stick but I was too far out. We got some really good pictures of Scorpions and Deep Purple though. You guys should have been there. It rocked!

Arkon/Shadow, whoever can explain this to me... I go to this site and it displays the last update as 'Hazardous Raptor's Profile' and I KNOW there've been a zillion changes/updates since then, including the remodeling of the main page. What's the deal, why can't I see it?

<div id='container'>
 Go, Noriko!

I think he's talking about Phantasy Star Online. You can still play online. But I didn't think V2 could get online yet.wel humm am 6 month,s online with v2 now so i dont now where you come from but here it,s online a long time now and dreamcast dead well not really its very alive here i still have 2 dc and about 130 games for it

boy oh boy....that is really a shame  8O  if that happened to me I would kill myself.  But i hope you get back on track. Colouring in photoshop works well if you dont want it done by hand

<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh. :) "This sea ain't big enough for the two of us .. uh .. green .. water dwellers..! Yeah!" ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
if it is still open, I will join. I have a few ideas for fixins and changes and whatnot...and I can do a bit of soundwork perhaps. As well I am going to try learning hex.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
its be fun to really mess up the game...like, replace the asterite with the vortex queen sprite. i can picture that now...ecco going to meet the asterite and being surprised to see a big ugly floating beetle thing head. Oh yeah, on a completely different topic, I found out today that scorpions actually came from the ocean...gives some more relevance on Ed's Vrotex integration thing.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The Vortex Queen in memory is just the Vortex Queen from Ecco 1. In the demo, she falls through the tube in an animation, and that ends up stored in RAM/VRAM somewhere if you stop the demos right there (using the demo editor, but hitting start over and over VERY fast and then using a hacked debug menu may work too). She looks more like a giant green almond with a mouth and eyes to me. )Also, does anyone else see a huge resemblance between the Vortex and their hives and the art of H.R. Giger?Yea, I'll have to fix those dates. :) Thanks for noticing, I sure didn't.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
thinking of hist's comment on the crazy ed...holy shit. you have to be insane to make a story as messed up as ecco. It is a good one, and I love it, but just think for a moment. a DOLPHIN. Who travels through TIME. to fight ALIENS.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Phosis)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah. But gigers aliens were far cooler then ecco's. and they will be again....a new movie, Alien Vs. Predator is currently in the works, putting the plots of three species, Alien, (by giger) Predator, (The movie with arnold schwarzenagger in it) and Humans. For those who like the movies, (dont know who wouldnt) Humans set down on LV 426 once again, after discovering the  existence of predators. Finding out that the predators love the hunt, they attempt to populate the planet with aliens, and once again, the aliens escape. There should be cool shit in their like the capture and escape of Preds, not to mention the design of Predaliens. Exciting.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Okay, thanks. First... i need acess to the board. I will see what i can do about music. I dont have too much experience, but I really want to help.

Very nice, Tethys! That'll look awesome colored! And I especially like the huge ass dude in the back. Tethys is actually pretty big, huh? CGing it should be a challenge, and I can't wait to see it!And...DOOMTRAIN!   Go throw yourself in with that smiley face, will you? Shut up about your CGing skills, because they're GOOD! If I hear you complain one more time I'll KILL YOU!!!!!!!

<br />

<div id='container'>
Very nice stuff! I LOVE concept art, it's so fun to get a look at what people think of in their heads! Putting the story into something visual! Fun fun!And yeah, since Doomtrain brought it up, I LOVE your face pic! I suppose Crestoe gets the credit on that but still, it's gorgeous, you're lucky!

Well, you don't have to be able to do graphics AND hacking AND sound, just some aspect of modifying ROMs. You can learn by experimentation (to hack the ROM), using some info from the Hacking the ROM section. You'll need a good Hex Editor to do this. To learn how to do sprite editing, you can use Tile Layer Pro and a pallette file (you can get Tile Layer Pro off the net, and Tails151 and I have the pallette if you want to try that out. I know next to nothing about editing the sounds, though, you're on your own there. :)Someone here might be willing to help you out. I can help you with hex editing and hacking, but the best advice I can give for that is to experiement and find out what all the parts of the ROM do, then try to change them in a logical fashion so you can make the game work to your liking.And how can I learn how to do that ?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I learned mostly by experimentation.. there's guides on the net though ... just for Sonic games, I've never seen an Ecco hacking guide.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Phosis) You should be able to go to the 1.5 board now.
</div>

I was told by someone on the Area51 Message Board that "A MUNKA SZABADDA TESZ" means "WORK MAKES YOU FREE" in Hungarian. I looked into this, and this text was apparently written on the walls of Nazi concentration camps. See this page//www.wwnorton.com/catalog/spring02/005046.htmI wonder why someone at Appaloosa would have put this message into the game. Perhaps it was an inside joke that their jobs were like prisons, like how people put jokes into things, like the "HELP, I'M BEING HELD PRISONER IN A SYSTEM SOFTWARE FACTORY" in Macintosh ROM code.I'm not sure if this is relevant, but Hungary may have been communist at the time that this game was in work.EDIT: Another translation I've recieved was, word-by-word (with some uncertain words), "A JOB WELL DONE". This would make sense, since it's displayed at where the end of the game was supposed to be.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Not just Sonic... There are Mario ones too *bricked*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah, ah! Nevermind, I got it!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ugh, Mario hacking ;) No, seriously, there's some fun things you can do in Mario games like jumping ludicriously high (over the flagpole) and watching random sprites fall from the sky (like Bowser), for no good reason. I only liked the NES games though .. and they're nowhere near as good as Sonic games. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I like it! But for some reason, nothing freaks me out more then the voretx head from ecco 1, no matter how elaborate....something about that damn head...the simplicity of it, the good animation...SOMETHING makes me afraid of it, even now. perhaps cause i first played the game when I was 7, and did not know I was going to be fighting it...then, when  dropped down into that black room, and saw those huge jaws, I immediately shut the game off in fear. Since that, I have hated fighting the end boss to that game...

Heh. Yea, but the problem is that...I'm kind of...erm...PSP challenged. o__o I've never used it before, so I'm kind of at a loss of what to do in it. lol. But still. I guess I could just fiddle around with it...see what happens. Just as long as I'm not like...."oooohhh....what does this button do? *click* *everything explodes*" .....o_o 'cuz knowing me, that would probably happen.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aha! So it WAS a compliment! Lol. Teehee. Thanks, Sten. *blushes* ^.^ the weird thing is...when I was younger, I could draw animals really well, but I couldn't draw people. Now I can draw people, but I can't draw animals for crap.  :?  Why is that? It's really frustrating. &gt;.o
</div>
<br />

Really? O__O 'Cuz....yea. Everyone hates Geocities. *including herself* But I'm not very good with like...making websites or anything....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well there was originally supposed to be a bigger size gap in between all of them, or at least between Tethys and Tangaroa (the biggest one).  But it just didn't turn out that way when I drew it.  And besides, if I had made Tethys much smaller the other too, especially Alignak, would also have to be quite a bit smaller and then it would be a lot harder to work with them.  And I couldn't make Tangaroa any bigger cuz as you can see he barely fits on the paper as it is.  So let's just say he's smaller than I originally had him...or else the others are all bigger.  Ah, whatever.Anyway, this project will have to be postponed because I just got a request from someone.  And I just don't think I should be putting off requests to work on something that I'm pretty much doing just for the hell of it, especially something that will take as long as this project probably will.  But it should only take about a week, give or take a few days, to get this request finished.

Ad i do it again. o_o;Hey everyone. Ive been workin on face pics and they havent been comign out the way ive wanted them too. Sorry about this, its kinda frustraiting but i'll try to have atleast 2 members with shiny purdy Crestoe Made face pics before the end of this week!

Yeah, Archie Bunker used to call that one guy "Meat Head" Dont rememeber the guys name but that show kicks ass.Ofcourse, my All inthe Family has nothin' to do with it, just the name.

<div id='container'>
The one of Usagi also looks quite good, I like the background.Where do people get these photos they use in backgrounds?  I don't have any that would make good backgrounds and those I have aren't big enough.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That really sucks, Noriko.In my case, my sketch book doesn't have anything that I would miss in it, since I always tear out all the good stuff so I can scan it.  And I wouldn't miss the sketchbook itself either because the paper in it sucks.  The paper is weak and thin, and it's much too easy to erase a hole in it.  But there's no use wasting it all, it's just a shame trees had to die to make such useless paper.Well anyway, Photoshop isn't that hard to learn.  When we first got it I opened one of the sample pictures that it comes with and tested out every filter to see what it did.  And I still just recently learned a few new things that I can do with it. And if you do something and decide you don't like it, there's always the undo command.  Or, if necessary, you can just close the image you're working on without saving and then open it up again, which is no big deal if you've already saved it at another time.  Or, if you really get messed up, you can rescan the image and start over.Or, there's always Paint.  It may not have all the cool effects or anything, but it works.

Try looking on eBay. I bought Ecco 1 about two or three years ago from FunCoLand. God I hate that place. They ripped me off once. &gt;.&lt;

<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, and your "All in the Family" is funnier. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I stand corrected then. One of my friends was complaining 'cause she couldn't get hers to connect to the net, so that's why I thought V2 couldn't get online yet.

<div id='container'>
I've been playing with my Ecco 2 final ROM and changed the text, but that's it. Also I changed the text on my Megaman 7 ROM. Changing text is fun! XD

<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmm...perhaps one of the folks over at Appaloosa just has a sick sense of humor? Perhaps they liked Nazis and wanted to put it in there to be "funny"? I don't know, it's like 1 AM. @.@
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ha. Sorry...reading your basic description of Ecco made me chuckle, Pho. :P But you're right - it is a rather...bizarre storyline when you actually stop and think about it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thats probably becuz she either didnt pay for it or becuz when she went to enter in to buy her hunters liscense, she put in the the wrong serial or key.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yup! Personally, I really don't care how long it takes yew...just as long as I get a pretty avatar made by Crestoe. ^_^ To tell you the truth, I had almost forgotten that I was waiting for one. o.o heh....

<div id='container'>
Hey, no problem! What are friends for? ^_-
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heya Crimson! I have no idea who you are and you probably have no idea who I am! But Hi anyways. ^_____^;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe. Thanks, Tethys. ^.^ And yea, I kind of understand what you mean about popular things. More often than not, that's the way I am, too. But my brother brought over all his games one day and...lo-and-behold!!! FFVIII was in the stack. I just thought the front looked intriguing, so I popped it in my playstation...and I've been hooked ever since. lol. I thought that it would be all...blah and boring, but nope. I love it! I haven't really played FFVII(erm...yea, 7. Roman numerals...so confusing) so I don't really know....a lot of people I know say that it was good, but...I don't know. I couldn't really get into it. I've played IX, too, but VIII remains my ultimate favourite. Except for the fact that I bawled like a baby at the ending. o_o Urf. I'm talking too much again, aren't I? =D *shuts up*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmm...maybe I will try PSP. Most of the time I just use paint, too. lol. If you see my pics in my fanart profile....I did 'em in paint. Except for the ones I scanned, of course. I'm actually just goofing around with a pic I drew of Selphie in paint. Pretty fun. Anyways, about the sketchbook. I know what you're saying, and usually I wouldn't even care (I tear out the good stuff, too) but I hadn't finished the pics, so I left them in the book. And it was a particular book that I really liked. The paper was thick (but not too thick) and it was really easy to erase. You could use any type of medium you wanted to on it...charcoal, pencil, pastel...and it wouldn't fold under or rub off or anything. Grrrr....it was really nice.  But I guess I could just go out and buy a new one. Lol. If I had money and I knew where to look, that is.    :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have to admit, I'm impressed that such a 'useless' topic has made it to page two. o.o One would have thought it would have died around the....um...7th post? *shrug* but oh well. I'm only adding to the madness as soon as I click this 'submit' button anyways.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I know what I'll do!= I'll stay up (late night is when I feel most creative and 'alive', one might say) and pound my head on the wall until I come up with a creative, captivating plot and story for my character! =D MWAHAHAHAHAHA! Or then again....I could always just turn it into a comic. o.o But that might be more work...and I'd still have to have a story. D'OH! x.x

Yeah, but if I buy Ecco 2 by the site of a american or canadian shop, the game will be in NTSC, and I won't be able to play with it (my tv and Genesis are for european standar, PAL)...

I learned mostly by experimentation.. there's guides on the net though ... just for Sonic games, I've never seen an Ecco hacking guide.Hacking Sonic games...It can be cool !

I don't think I'll ever be able to understand anyn of that, especially just by looking at formulas and reading stuff.  It's much easier if someone shows me, but in this case I doubt that I would understand it even then.Hey, ancient people were able to survive without this stuff, weren't they?  Of course it was probably invented in ancient times, but there still would have been a time when people lived without that.We should all go back to the simpler days of ancient times--before math was invented.

Oh, they're putting them in aquariums?When I first read the headline I thought they were killing them, because I know that in Japan they eat whales and in some other areas too.Well it's not like nobody's ever captured orcas and put them in aquariums.  I think they're endangered, but we put endangered species in zoos, too.  So I don't see how this is much different.  Not that I approve of it or anything, but if they're so worried about the orca population what about dolphins and what about all the animals they capture and put into zoos?  Aren't they worried about the wild population of other endangered species?  You'd think they'd have the same sort of problem.Actually I'm not even completely sure orcas are endangered, I think they are but I can't remember.

That was sick x.xUh...right...let's see...Cinderella...The Brothers Grimm, because they wrote the original Cinderella (original titled Ashputtel, or at least in the book I used to have) along with several other stories that Disney made movies out of...altho the original versions are much more..."grimm".   (that was a bad pun)One of her step-sisters cut off her heel and the other cut off her toes so that the glass slipper would fit them. x.o

Ecco the Dolphin, for Sega GenesisEcco Defender of the Future, for Sega DreamcastI don't have boxes for ANY of my Genesis games, and I only have two instruction manuals, including the one for Tides of Time.  I only lost the manual for Ecco 1 recently.  The games themselves seem to be in good condition, last time I played them.  It's the Genesis that's not in such good condition.DotF is in good condition, and I have the case and manual.  Of course I never did play it much, but only because I simply don't play video games much anymore.Oh, and I've rented Ecco Jr. a few times, but that doesn't count.

Well I actually have four characters.  But I haven't really developed them much.Well first I may as well tell you about my original idea for Tethys when I first created her.  Tethys was originally a Sanaya, something that I made up a long time ago and I can't remember why.  Sanayas live on a planet called Mundagua, or something like that...I got it from the Spanish words "mundo" for "world" and "agua" for "water"..thus, "water world."  Anyway this planet, which is an alternate dimension of Earth, is covered in about 90% of water, due to a great flood.  The Sanayas are descended from a race of creatures that lived on the land before the planet was flooded.  They have telekinetic powers and are very intelligent, and have created an underwater society.  Oh, and they look similar to dolphins, but different in some ways, and they come in all colors and are shiny like gemstones.  Tethys was a scientist and discovered a means of traveling between parallel universes.  She travelled to Earth but something went wrong and she couldn't go back.  And...that's about as far as I got.The new Tethys is completely different.  She is one of the four Guardians of the Oceans.And that's where my other characters come in.  When the ocean was born, Llyr appeared.  Originally there was one ocean called Panthalassa (that's an actual fact) and Llyr was the gaurdian of this ocean.  So far all I've figured out about Llyr is that it has no gender, I have no idea what it looked like.  Anyway, when the continents shifted and Panthalassa was devided into four seperate oceans, Llyr himself "seperated" (I have yet to figure out exactly what happened here) into the four Guardians of the Oceans.  I believe it was approximately 65 million years ago that the oceans first took on the shape that they have now.Tethys is the Guardian of the Atlantic Ocean.  She resembles an elasmosaur and is about the size of a whale (not including her long tail).  Tethys is shy, and tends to worry more than her brothers and sister.  She is the one who warned the Atlanteans of the Vortex kind and told them of a dolphin that would in the future save the Earth, giving them inspiration to build the time machine and the glyphs.  (this is assuming, of course, that Atlantis was in the Atlantic Ocean, seeing as that may be where the ocean gets its name)The other three I have devoloped even less.Tangaroais the Gaurdian of the Pacific Ocean.  He resembles a cross between a whale and a shark and is about the size of a large whale.  Alignak is the most peaceful and quiet of the four. (pacific means peaceful)Salacia is the Guardian of the Indian Ocean.  She resembles a campchurch (half unicorn, half fish) and her size is between that of a dolphin and an orca.  She is very playful.Alignak is the Guardian of the Arctic Ocean.  He resembles an ancient crocodilian, but, like the others, is warm blooded.  He is a little smaller than a dolphin.  Alignak is cunning and mischievous.Um...that's all I guess.

FuncoLand was in all likelihood founded by Satan as a means of getting entertainment out of ignorant gamers like myself.  I brought ecco the dolphin dotf there (MINT FUCKING CONDITION I care about my stuff more than anythng esle in the world) and got 4 dollars.  Sonic adventure, also mint, since that game is fucking gay and i only beat it once, 3 dollars.  Next time i'll try Ebay.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well that dolphin thing was probably put in because it was cool, but taken out perhaps because it didnt add to the gameplay well enough.  I don't think it had much to do with the story.  Genesis action games weren't exactly known for little things like detailed plots and character development.
</div>

Toucan Sam is probably based off of the white British people who moved to Africa set up colonies, and exploited the native black people.

I think they are all idiots. whale trappers, the people who trap dolphins to take to sea world, (dont know the technical names here, people.) They all suck. Especially since they are trapping animals SMARTER then we are. oh well. When the end of the world comes, and the dolphins are the only ones to escape, who will be laughing then? Well, the dolphins, of course. Unless the world ends up like DOTF where we all live in peace and harmony...But at the ratye things are going, it is highly doubtful..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
None of those "cheats" even makes any sense. We already know a code to "get all levels" which works and also makes a lot more sense.And why would you want to become a shark and eat other dolphins?  Or become a whale?  Either way you could never get through any of the levels like that.It would be cool to have an invincible code.  But even if it worked that way it wouldn't really be worth it.  And, I can't really remember, but aren't the yellow and red speckled fish the ones that are poisonous?

FF Anthology (IV, V - Euro ver.) is excellent, a good remake of the originals. I also like how they re-did some of the music for the game on there. IV is good, but I can't beat Zeromus *snarls in fustration* and in V i'm just up to Gilgamesh, as I'm slow in that ) Kefka is a freak - your just waiting for him to do the Alfred Ashford laugh you know... Setzer is cute... I swear - its always the guys with the nice silver hair (not evil oldman grey, silver) that are cute... , Gau is even cute in his own way D *laughs* FFVIII is good, i'm up to Ultemacia, Legendary Beast (Griever), and the incarnate of her GF(Griever) and Herself *shudders*. I have Eden too . FFIX was excellent, Kuja was hot (^^;;;;), the summons where goregeous, and the story made you keep playing. FFX *drools* I have only played it on my demo disk and I love it. Now I just need a PS2, not an evil hired one from the vid. store. evilbat)OOoohhhh, and I must say, i LOVE that pic of Ultemacia *drools* It pretty.. shes evil 0o;; 'Kurse you SeeDs!'

The whole thing is in my head and I'd really like to do it. So I suppose I'd do it anyway. I've written a bit more on this idea since the time I posted this.

Okay you fucking animal rights activist-wannabe's, We get the point. WTF is this, an animal rights forum? Quit bitching about it unless yer gunna go out there and do something about it, you seat &amp; monitor bums.HA ha ha ha i can't help but laugh at that qoute.Personally i dont think they should capture anymore orcas for captivity. I'm kinda seeing a point that it should slowly be done away with. I don't know why i think this cause i used to think it was a stupid idea. but animals like orcas and dolphins just cant handle the stress of it in some cases. I don't know what to think, guess after seeing free willy you understand how much it be nice to let them animals free to prevent the future making of gay movies like the one i just mentioned. naw free willy was alright. i loved the orca. stupid movie...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Remember the Sonic 2 Delta hack? The goal is to make it look like a version after the real beta but before the final. I'm adding new messages and plot to match the final and hacking the hex of the ROM, Tails151 is doing the graphics editing, and we have some other people onboard too. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm not so sure the Asterite rambles about shit-- I don't remember him being a fecaphiliac. ;) Seriously, yes, we can modify the Asterite's messages to say whatever, but currently you have to stay within the length of the original message. You can break it up into multiple screens, but the size of the text block we can work with right now is "SING TO THE SHELLED ONES AND THEY WILL HEAL YOUR WOUNDS". I'm working on finding ways to lengthen the amount of text you can insert. )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hum...It isn't a really an happy birthday, but...lol ! It doesn't matter, Arky !  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The Asterite rambles about "I remember you! Of course, it was you... And it was I who sent you..." in the original, when he sends you to steal the globe from his past self.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oh I need that thing i think
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ecco's hard work and 'attempt' to distory the Time machine frees him from the perils of normal cronology and sets in into a 'free' limbo of the tides of time?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Crestoe makes several compelling arguments.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ha crestoe. I thought you only liked rap...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ahh yes. That was what I was referring to. I have Photoshop 7 tho, so I dont care.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lolYeah, I just remember him saying 'Now it is clear' and I was always like "It's... not too bloody clear to me..."
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah!Sounds like a lotta work. But you guys seem to be having fun!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ecco used to scare the piss outta me. Prob'ly because things used to pop out at you all the time. I was also scared to death of the octopus in the Undercaves. Literally.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Haven't heard too much out of Green Day lately. I don't know, I liked their song.... umm.... Minority? The Minority? I dunno. Not a big fan of 'em, but that song was pretty good.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tell me about it Delphi...I am still scared of it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I spent a good few days looking at the rom...found some interesting stuff! If you look carefully, you can find almost EVERY message from ecco 1. I found the entire story of the atlantians destruction...But man all that language is confusing...does anyone know how to rip sprites from the rom?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That was already known and documented in the About the ROM ) And yes, you can rip the sprites, you can use a Tile Editor like Tile Layer Pro, and a .tpl (pallette file) for the beta ROM, which Tails151 and I have.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh, yep, I knew what you meant. It's really not too clear until you beat the game just what the HELL he's talking about. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Exsqueeze me? :) Well, my opinion of it is that Ecco tried to destroy the Time Machine and accidentially used it (not hard to do, I imagine, since he uses sonar to destroy things, and uses sonar to activate the Time Machine), or he intended to use it, and he ends up getting "reborn" in the future in DOtF. However I will not get into DOtF too much considering that.. well.. it's not truly an Ecco game. I mean, warning lights go on for me when Ed Annunziata didn't do the story, Spencer Nilsen didn't do the music, and there's no Vortex or Asterite..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Since so many people want to edit the Ecco 2 Beta sprites, I'll be posting an "Accessories" page with all of the things needed to do that and more .. I'll post a copy of TLP and the Pallete file there for anyone who wants to use them. I may also put up links to some Hex Editors, and upload SegaTool and StealthPatch.

No it doesn't exist. I said that because sporks are funny! No, I said that because I got a spork at Taco Bell the night before and I wanted an interesting going away post. Which it was.

To Artreus)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tethys, was your idea based on the Greek/Roman Mythology, or is that coincidence? I know they had different gods for various rivers and bodies of water much smaller then whole oceans.The story of Artreus becomes more and more complex as I tie different ideas together. They start out unrelated and I try to work my charcters into them, which has interesting results. Whats hard is identifying all the new characters to the reading. Characters like Kae and Balae are very obvious to me, but are hardly made known to the reader. I guess that's what other stories are for. My most recent additions to the story line are Svyku, Anlay, and Kindi. There are a couple others unnamed yet. Kindi is one of those tie in's. She's not a dolphin, but will be when I pull her into one of my next stories.

Aw, you posted this just after I left. It's good to have gotten over the loss, but its ok to still hurt from time to time. You can't dwell on death too long, but you must not forget those who are gone.

<div id='container'>
Losing progress is  .....ouch. But, it's important to keep going. I hope someday to use photoshop, which I think will be in one of my classes next year. Most of the good programs on my computer are not-legal, but the computer isn't good enough to run anything nice anyway.

Yeah, I know what you mean about Hard Water - those ice blocks DON'T show up on sonar, and its a bitch. I died so many times in that because I couldn't figure out the paturn of the ice blocks. Then I did - sped away to the exit :D There is also a longer way to go to get to the ice blocks that isn't as hard as going down that tunnel with the speedy iceblocks. Hehehe.

is this relevant but what does the Text say in the beta op?  I see lots of tiny black letters moving through space.  Is it the same prolog as in the final?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Play it in Gens. The text displays properly there. It says, directly from the ROM he .saved the earth, and .he destroyed the evil.      vortex,        .or so he tought...   .the vortex queen    .detaches from the   .hive and falls      .into the tube behind.the escaping pod of .dolphins.           .she is puzzled  by  .what has just       .happened: a small   .dolphin has managed .to attack the hive  .and battle its  way .to her chamber.     .the dolphin attacked.her during her  feed.state - she was weak.and very suprised.  .    he beat her.    .now she must follow .the pod to the earth.to start a new hiveNot quite formatted correctly, but it's the same text, nonetheless. Note that they misspelled "thought".

http the cart is 24 megabits.  Almost every other 32X full game is less size than that.  Basically all the demo is doing is taking the video data and just spooling it directly from cart to screen. Since it is not a CD and there is no major slowdown they were able to go larger screen and more detail.  I really haven't played with it much other than piecing the cart together but I don't think you'll find very much with a hex editor in there.  The only way I was able to figure out that all these chips go together was to find the frame marks and use those as markers to figure out which chip went where.  Hope that helps a bit more with the cart."To wrap things up i been looking for this rom for years. sad to say there isnt much to this rom except that is was a short movie clip of an introduction. nothing mroe was developed on it. or nothing more was developed and shown off to the media.

Noriko has over 500 posts, and is not a member of Earth Clan. Therefore she has the sentinel rank, something I've only seen on Eao, though others are qualified. People that are in Earth Clan have the rank covered up to display the Clan status.

I tried it in my ROM and it wouldn't work .. well, I'll check it out. I'll fix the things you pointed out, Thanks, Tails.  Definitely see RoF, it kicks SO much ass. The quantities of ass it kicks are immeasurable. :)

Ho-ho...I can't change my details...It doesn't work..."Not allowed to directly alter user informations"...You and Eao seem to have simlar problems with this.

The complete demo. There was no completed Ecco 32X game. Before this, all we had was about half of it, at which point it would crash.

<div id='container'>
i was woundering if any levels in Ecco have shortcut glitches (american ROM has it as with the cart ..)if you've been to the intersting things you'd see my discovery, that I think I even found out using the genisis version.but what about the rest? are these glitches or deliberate?Can rom hacking show us more?whatu think?

I'm not using post nuke, mabye i'd like to because everyone is and i's soooooooooo cool!so I'd be cool as well.*kicks her web page*heh I lost track of the piccies I uploaded, Make sure you don't do that either Stene........lost piccies cause migraines

well...i just thought id post it cuz i know sten might be interested :D and im sure there are other of you out there too"Sunday, July 21, 2002BCTV News on GlobalAurora's new calf.The Vancouver Aquarium's beluga whale Aurora has given birth to a second calf. The baby popped out Saturday evening in front of about 200 spectators. Aurora's calf, whose sex isn't known yet, is happily swimming alongside its mom. Aquarium officials say they will be watching in the next 24 hours to see if Aurora is nursing her baby. In 1995 Aurora gave birth to a female calf named Qila -- the first beluga conceived and born in captivity in Canada. Aurora is 14 years old. Female belugas reach sexual maturity at age five and tend to calve once every three years. Belugas can live up to 30 years."so there you go ^^ a new beluga.

Since a lot of people are posting pictures of themselves, I figured it would be an idea if we all drew ourselves! What would you look like if you were a comic book character?Just draw a comical self portrait and post it here! Let's see the cartoon character in you!So, here's me... I actually drew this for my Ctrl+Alt+Delete site (if you notice the style), and I saw this topic idea somewhere else, so I figured I'd start it here!Yeah... me! ^_^http://beisick.dolphinparadise.net/krystal.jpg

Hi everyone! I'm late on sayin this but I finally got back from my trip and I had fun! It was sooo cool,because I saw this ranch and when i looked at the name of it,I was like  because the name of the ranch was-Fin &amp; Feather-I almost thought that it said Fin to feather from Ecco tot!!! But I got some new stuff like,a dolphin clock and an MP3/CD player for,like,60$ in Canada! Anyway,I had a lot of fun! :D

Ah, come on Sten! You got to at least give it a shot! No one said it had to be good or anything. Maybe you could just try a little chibi you or something like that. ^_^ You can do it!Swifty too!

I have Photoshop 5.5, my mom got a copy from E-Bay, one that was legally copied (I dunno how you can copy something legally, but somebody did it. o.o).  So therefore it was much cheaper.

Mine would have to be anime-style because I can't do anything else.Actually I did do an anime self-portrait once, but it's a bit outdated now.  I also drew a furry version of myself once (which is on my Side 7 archive), but that's also a bit outdated.

In the original version by the Brothers Grimm she was called Ashputtel because they made her sleep by the fireplace and she was always covered in ashes.  And Cinderella includes the word "cinder" and cinders are pretty much the same thing as ashes.  And Cenicienta makes sense because it sounds like it probably came from "ceniza" which, unless I'm remembering wrong, means "ash".  And I'm guessing it's the same way with the French version, especially since the first part sounds kinda like the English.I never would have even thought about it if I hadn't read the original version, which actually explains why they named her Ashputtel.  I wonder what happened to that book anyway? It dissappeared not long after I got it, I think we found it in a house that my sister bought.  It was an old book, that had a bunch of stories by the Brothers Grimm.Ahem....anyway...We should continue with the game...I guess that last thing was what Noriko said--the Grim Reaper.So my addition will be Brad Pitt.  Because he played Death in "Meet Joe Black".  Which I've heard was a remake of an old movie (the name of which I can't think of now) but I never saw that one.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Haha DOTF is no more a continuation to Ecco 2 than tha new Planet of the Apes was to the original, and everyone knows that.  I have no idea why everyone feels they have to invent a new impossible storyline that would make Digimon fans laugh at them.  David Brin is a jackass and he changed the plot - I have no trouble whatsoever accepting that.  In fact, here's tha Histronic theory why we dont have a real Ecco 3----Ed Annuitza  Oh, Ed.  We can't release your game since Im a total fucking sellout who's currently having sex with Steven Spielberg and I agreed have to release a Lost World game instead.  Oh, by the way, our new name is Appaloosa... yeah i don't know what the hell an appaloosa is either but it sure sounds spiffy, huh?  Oh by the way you're fired, dolphin boy.

Actually, Gens runs 32X games almost perfectly, to my knowledge...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds pretty accurate ;) Except I'm sure Ecco 3 wasn't anywhere near completiion, if it was even started. Appaloosa is apparently some kind of horse (or something horse-related). What a shitty name for a game company .. especially for one made famous by their games about a *dolphin*.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Crestoe, how much longer do you think until you're done with the avatars? just curious.  :D

<div id='container'>
well, that is the twist here... you see, whitefin just got out of winter break. that would certainly explain "the snow" that was mentioned before. when it is summer here in the states, it's winter down in australia, so she's already had her summer vacation  :)

I have a copy of both the "Ecco 2 Playable Preview" and the "Ecco 2 Beta", and I plan to do a hex comparison of them and find out just what is different, which I will then publish on the site. I'll also put up both versions of the ROM. Does anyone have anything to contribute about the difference between these two versions?

Aw dammit there goes another potential Histronic article -_-

<div id='container'>
Yeha an appaloosa is a breed of horse.  Yeah, i know.  i don't get it either.I'm pretty sure that ecco might actually have been pretty close to completion.  As soon as ecco 2 is complete, what does Ed do?  He doesn't work at starbucks or anything, so he probably went right to work on 3.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i thought ecco PC needed a disk/CD?

I'm pretty sure its tha same thing except arkon screwed with one, as i recall.

I think you need that disk to install it but it can be played without it.

i thought ecco PC needed a disk/CD?Yeah, you have to engrave it before installing. Don't panic, I put a file named "instructions" on the FTP to tell you what you must do.

We're talking about two versions of the Ecco 2 Beta .. one of which Histronic says he thinks is just a modified version .. I certainly haven't noticed any differences between the two versions. The differences are probably only minor hex differences you couldn't notice actually playing the game.

My personal fav and most well done anime i must say would have to be Blue Sub 6, even if it didn't get good reviews I loved the 'mutants' as they so called them in the series. It's a perfect anime to watch if you like anything dealing with the ocean AND anime.Also Range Murata's art is certainly one of a kind! (he's the one who drew the character and creature designs in BS6)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I don't know why it took me so long to reply but,those are all great Noriko! We practically turned the subject from talking about art,to talking about FF games. 
</div>

<div id='container'>
i &lt;3 card captor sakura! well....its one of the few anime's we get here o.o but princess monokoe was an awsome movie! i loved it!

unless you wanna turn out like Crestoe, Hist, and Yogoat, I would most definitely get your 15 bucks back.

<div id='container'>
I like the desing of some Anime, like Sakura Captor Card. It's, according to me, one of the only beautiful Anime.

<div id='container'>
WOW ! Noriko !!! Great artwork !

I bought this ecco guidebook,and on the level "Ice and Fire" it says you only hit the clan dolphin 3 times and I hit it 5 and it still wasn't dead. some of the locations of the vitalits that it points out are all screwed up. And well,it's not the best guide but for me,since you hardly see any Ecco stuff anymore,it was sorta a "rare" find.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I tested the original rom on AGES.  It worked great for me but it does have an error show up when you first run it.  Just hit ok and it plays fine.  Not sure about any of the other emulators.AlanD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
RetroDrive will run it fine.

<div id='container'>
...reason being I have been spending the last few days in a tired, clueless haze, not much makes sense if you are exhausted and insomniatic....(Hmmm was that right...?) wink:

<div id='container'>
What IS the best Emmulator to use then? :(

Dang! Seems the link is down, now I wont know what the pic looked like...

<div id='container'>
Agreed spiderwing, Ocean and Manga/Anime my two favourate things.I have sen so many that to name them all would take up a forum on its own! So lets just say my favourates are: Blade of the Berserker, Samurai X and Ninja Scroll. 8)

I upgraded the forum to one of our looks we were saving until the entire site was converted to postnuke. The name of the new style is "Illmatic" and eventualy it will be the new look of Arkonviox.com along with many other skins which we hope to have aviable. since the forum can't relly be customized this will be its look.Hope everyone lieks the upgrade. i can already feel that it kicks major ass ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It's nice-looking, overall. And the buttons are actually a noticeably different color from the text on them, too!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
From the Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles hacking site:Cheat CodesThis section will enable you to change the cheats to whatever you them to be. First of all, you need to understand how the Genesis deals with buttons on the control pad. Here is the info you need.01 - Up02 - Down04 - Left08 - Right00 01 - A00 02 - B00 04 - C00 08 - Start
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's true, It kicks ass.  Great work with this pro skin.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the new thread buttons and new replie buttons didnt come out as perfectly as iw anted but im not gonna worry about if they match i think they ame out alright.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
WOW !! Awesome design, Arkon !  8O
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Crestoe designed it, i can't wait until my whole website will be using "Illmatic" and you wont have to worry cause i plan to keep the old look as a skin feature.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Blade of the Beserker! (Aka. Sword of Berserk). I saw that full anime this week, and man, it rocks. The ending it's a true jewel.Ninja Scroll was bloody too, and great.

I'm jealous.... 8O  Those are amazing! You have a really cute style and I like how you do your eyes....it's cute! The last one is my favorite but your right, it does look a wee bit familiar. Oh well. It's coo.

<div id='container'>
8O Sweeeeeet! i love the new look!!!!!

Nope, wrong format... The cheat code would in a similar place to Debug, and I couldn't find that with that format.

ALL the site ?! But I LOOOOOOVE the current design of the site...

<div id='container'>
Yeah, I noticed it looked different.  I opened the forum and said "Woah!"I think it looks really cool!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ice and Fire? I played that just earlier today...You have to stun the dolphin first. When he's an ice dolphin have him run into the fire sphere, and when he's a fire dolphin, have him run into the ice sphere. Remember to hit him when he's stunned, or the level could go on a long time.I never see anything for Ecco. Even on the internet it's kind of hard to find.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh jeeze!  I forgot about this!  Otherewise I would have already drawn something.  Well, now it's going to have to wait because I always do my drawings at night and I have to go to bed early tonight.Oh, and I think that looks good Noriko!And Neko, welcome!  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
How about Teknoman? That's the first anime I've seen, and now my brother and I are trying to prove to people that it existed. :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well... That was interesting.   X . X
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
glew?Oh! I honestly didn't know what you meant at first but I'm thinking you mighta meant "glow" in the past tense...in which...that doesn't sound right but niether does "glowed"...oh well, whatever.Tethys, was your idea based on the Greek/Roman Mythology, or is that coincidence? Ummm...I never even thought about that to tell the truth.  The name Tethys does come from Greek mythology, and Salacia is from Roman mythology.  Tangaroa is Polynesian (I think that's what it was) and Alignak is Inuit, and Llyr is Celtic (I can't remember if it was Irish or Welsh).  I'm no expert in Greek mythology but it is a big interest of mine, so that was probably in the back of my head when I came up with the idea,  Actually at first it was just Tethys as the guardian of all the oceans, then I thought why not have one for each ocean.  And Tethys, in Greek mythology, is the name of the wife of the titan Oceanus who was  basically the ocean, I believe.  So the original idea was kinda based off that.  I know there are different gods for all the rivers and seas and everything, but I wasn't thinking about that when I came up with these characters.  And I don't know if there's one for each ocean.hmmm...even all there siblings and split from the one orginal gauridean what if the oceans gaurds split/breed/created sea ones...I mean theres alotta water to cover and one critter has a big job to do.Hm...I didn;t think about that  either.  Well, the Guardians themselves are big, or at least Tethys and Tangaroa are.Actually I was thinking they really don't have anything to do with rivers, lakes, and seas.  I guess that's somebody else's job.  Or maybe they could be in charge of them...but they do have a lot of power, even if they prefer to use as little of it as possible.  I dunno.  Like I said, I haven't really developed them much. I guess I'll have to think about that some more.

Personally, my fav is DBZ, but not everyone puts it under the anime category cuz of the quality and content.But if its straight naime, id have to say Cowboy Bebop has always been a favorite even before it appeared ont h cartoon network. That, and Outlaw Star.

Just some retard that, like, knows me n shit.And to awnser Norikos question, i have some done but their looks are questionable cuz i havent been able to get them all looking good. They look half ass cuz ive been stressed over this piece of shit box with a type-writter on it (Computer) Screwing up on me 24/7. I have to get Arkon over here so he can fix the damn thing.You wouldnt be able to get avatars done if yer computer reseted on you in the middle of doing an avatar. Happend well i was doing SilverFins face pic. When it reseted, it saved the file but inside was just some fucked up distortion and none of my work. So sorry for not gettin them to you guys sooner, although you say take yer time. Its just that i like to get them to you ASAP and this piece of shit wont let me even finish them.

I was hooked to DBZ when it was emited here. I don't care if people considers it crap, that anime rocks. Someone gave me the whole thing in divx, but looks like I at last, I will return the stuff. 50+ divx cd's are a long watching time...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh. I actually liked DBZ for a long time. But then I saw the original DragonBall series. I like it better. DBZ has too much violence 'n junk. And the plots all seem kinda redundant. But I dunno. *shrug* That's just my opinion. My sister calls it the Constipation(sp?) Show. ^_-

YOU ARE GREAT... (quote from ecco 2 beta which I am having lotsa fun with.)

Ages. seems like the only one that can get it to run.advice when running it. first you dont need the roms. second you have to set your monitor to 16 bits. that should do the trick
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
In english sure. DBZ in japanese is of much higher quality. I have a few of the dvd's, but I personally dont watch a lot of tv...I watch very very little tv. Id have to say the only anime I have ever really loved is Akira, because I love the Manga. But, my favorite manga in the ENTIRE WORLD is GON. I love that little dino.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Who is being mean? I simply stated a fact
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i dont think any of the glitches in the rom are delibrate. glitches are mistakes and most mistakes arent done on purpose.hacking might do some interesting things like the possiblity of unlocking levels that accidently made it into a final that werent suppsoe to be there. My idea is there probably isnt any since im sure when the final was made they probably removed anything unnessary.thats why the beta is so intriging.
</div>

heh i forgot all about the adds. im gonna have to remind myself to include them in an update.

The copyright notice at the bottom of the forum is slightly wrong. It should read: "Ecco The Dolphin" is copyright Sega, developed by Appaloosa Interactive.In the console gaming world, when you release a game, the console maker owns your intelectual property under license, not yourself.

If anyone can figure out the Gens "debugger" and happens to know 68k asembly, it shouldn't be too hard.if you can get that runtime debugger to capture opcode logs then its just a matter of stepping through memory and seeing what I/O gets watched for and when. Put on your debugging vest ;)

To tell you the truth I only liked DBZ or anything relating to it for a while because it was popular among the kids at school n such. Then i realized how little of a plotline it has. Sure the art has its own style, but it you're a true anime/manga lover what anime doesn't?And now for shits n giggles I'm gonna list all the anime I currently have.Record of Lodoss War (the entire series)Lain (the entire series)Trigun (the entire series)Outlaw Star (the entire series)Cowboy BebopDragon HalfCrest of Stars (really good anime)Princess MononokeMy Neighbor Totoro (that is one trippy movie)Soultaker (if you wanna good laugh at a 'trying to be serious and melancholic anime' that is the one)Blood the last VampireVampire Hunter D (bloodlust AND the original)Night on the galactic railroadSpring and chaosAh my Goddess!(the movie AND the manga)Saber Marionette JEvangelion (the entire series)Escaflowne (the entire series but borrowed lol)and i had Ranma 1/2 but i gave it away so I can start getting the DVDsWelp, that's all of it. And imagine that I didn't even list Blue Sub 6! Heh!About Sword of Beserk and Samurai X, I want to see em and thanks for the comments! A word of advice though, they ruined Samurai X by making the Rouruni Kenshin series. Sure i hear it gets great later on in the series, but come on man! Where did that sexy kenshin go!? (I really need to shut my trap sometimes.. v_v)LoL as you can see spider-chan has no life. Or rather an anime half life?

I photoshop did me a funny trick once, I saved a 128X128 image and it consumed 150mb, and becoming almost impossible to work with it. There was no mistery, it was a plain image (it was an avatar too, a shark).Avatars are unholy.

When it says "this page could not be found" You have to click on the name of the site,(entertainbilia.com) then go down to where it says Games/Plush etc. and click on the letter S under the category that you want,then it should take you to something that has to do with sonic. :)

heh sounds pretty cool. a glyph that poisens you. heh.I had one for an ecco the dolphin 3 for sega cd and genesis. It was different on sega cd and much better.It began with Ecco spinning lost in time and in the background showed old history events. (sega cd)the genesis version had Ecco spinning but in space. After a while he ended up appearing in a new atlantis with a new time machine. The time machine looked like two hands and there was a baby orca and sea tortuse waiting there for him and it turned out they acidently activated the time machine to bring ecco back.i couldnt remmeber the rest except for a strange puzzle you had to solve near a beach and a human scuba diver comes into contact with you to relay a message.the game play was wierd too. you had three different camera veiws at once the screen divided itself with one part to show what your inventory was (weapons items) the second screen showed a side view of ecco another screen a standard back view then a status screen telling if ecco was hungry and how his air situation is.Ecco had the power to levetate things so behind him if he found items in a level he could bring them with him. but only carry at least five. withen one level he could use teleport rings to go back to older levels. ( So you could go backwards if you missed something you needed for a later level. )There were also very short levels ment for you to get an item from and bring to the next lvel (much like secreat cave) instead you had to go back to these paticular levels every now and again for loading and unloading crap.anyways that was my dream o.o

ugh....clam juice...anyways, that is a really cool thing. Is the vortex sprite even creepier on the pc one?

Hello, I'm Epicenter. I'm interested to see anything you can do with the ROM, experiment with it and see what you can find out. We specifically want to find the format for the buttons pushed, i.e. A B C Start, etc. so we can see if the Demo Editor is still available in the final, and we'e also working on a hack to merge Ecco 2 and E2B, sort of like the Sonic 2 Delta hack by Esreal.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Uh,where eles would the blood be? Besides,I saw somewhere that the "liquid"on that level is the blood,but I may not be right. :?

<div id='container'>
Safe trip Phosis, and happy entrails.....uh...I mean....

<div id='container'>
see ya
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ok... I found another format... from the Sonic 2 Hacking Page this time... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (this is a byte represented in bits) S A C B U D L R (these are the bits translated to show what each key is) With a 1, that means the button is being used (on) and with a 0, the button isn't being used.http://www.sonichacking.org/s2hack/binary/demo.htm
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i believe the only blood you actually see in DoF was indeed in the stage "Heart of the Foe," but i never suspected it was the fluid at the bottom of the level... when you actually manage to blow up the foe queen's heart, a small amount of dark blood comes from the large arteries that held the heart in place...although it never seemed like enough blood to really be concerned about... i mean, not many of us even recalled that blood since it was in such a small amount. but that is the only case i think the warning would be referring to.

one of my orginal ecco 2 (MY ecco 2 before I played ToT)the vortex dosen't fall to earth in my verson,but just repets shit and blasts earth insted of sucking on it.ecco had a free fall level.another included a moving screen level in 3d...i was ecco and the screen smooshed me on a rock.most of my neo-game ecco dreams have him in 3d, i'm 'dying' to play DoTF knowing it's 3 dimental now I'm kinda ecco in those dreams.I did have two involdivg being in a buliding or sunken ship, there was not only an air pocket in this large ship but I had to flop on wood to get somthing.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Most of my dreams about Ecco are about bugs. I often do this one: I'm playing "Undercaves", and when I arrive close to the first key-glyph, there is a bug, and Ecco enters in a wall. He can't escape and dies...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks Lizzy  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think Shadow was in that one dream.....there was a black dolphin after ecco gets poisioned by the glyph(by that giant impossable jump)"now that we've meet I might as well poision you"there was a plastic fish card...i think nosing that antoxins you

This one doesn't look like it's used in E2B either, but then again, I'm not too sure of how to use it. I tried putting in the numbers for the keys (for ABCBCACAB for the final, or CCCCCCCC in the beta 12 14 13 ... etc., I also tried 21 41 31, reversing the position of the 1. No luck.Any other ideas..?

there most certainly is a dolphin soccer match in the DC version, kitnee, it's just not as obvious to find as in the ps2 version. it's bascially in the exact same place; within the hidden room in "Powers of Levitation," charging at the light to the right in the far back.... but i wouldn't suggest taking this as a reason to think that you are an idiot for missing it  :D

What do you mean, Trellius?

...The Ecco 2 Vortex are the same size as the ones from Ecco 1... And only edited to fit the proper palette.And the memory I was talking about is the one where the Asterite got destroyed... There are tiles near that of what look like Octopus/Squid tentacles, with suction cups on them.

Ark, the CD is music from older Sonic games. The booklet is just various information... The coin is just as it appears, a coin. If you're wondering how I know, I have it, but want to hold on to it. Sorry.

Well, one night I stayed up way too late playing The Lost Orcas, and guess what I dreamt about?It was like a recurring dream, I'd have it and an orca would lead me out one way, then I'd have it again and something different would happen.There was another that was like the 3d stage from Sonic 2. I had to navigate through the tubes like a water slide (Or Hanging Waters, but I hadn't played that level yet)I kept managing to die, so I switched to an orca and made it through the level. I then heard (Yes, heard) what I only guess was a female dolphin, a friend of Ecco's, I think.It was very wierd? Odd? something... In any case, I wrote it down and later added a second part and tossed it into the poetry section as 'Captive's Vow,' because I got the impression it was caused by Ecco being captured by the Vortex.

i believe, histronic, you are referring to the odd centipede/crab creature that ecco must battle in the stage "Blades in Motion"? i had always assumed that the dark green, cloudy substance it was producing from under its body was a kind of ink for defense, since it usually dispensed this fluid after being hit or when attacking ecco and the small green eels in the room with a hoarse "hissing" noise...of course i could be completely wrong... even so, like i had said before, the warning almost seems a bit gratuitous since the game itself has such a minuscule amount of blood in it.in my complete opinion, the game seems to be actually lacking in blood in logistical kinds of situations, such as toppling the massive stalactites down onto the crocodile in "Caverns of Hope." not a drop of blood was shed by that beast even when such a huge, pointed rock formation had struck it in the back. i'm not suspecting immediate impalement from that, but the croc simply swam up and broke through the rock wall blocking ecco's way as though it was just spooked by something. not even so much as a difference in its swimming due to the injury as it left... but ecco has never been known for its gore value in the gaming world, so even just the blood seeping from the foe queen's heart may come as a step above what the normal ecco games are used to...

did anyone find out how the rom uses music and what file it is?because the 'lost tracks' in ecco 1 can be used for the beta levels (seeing as how they are in it alredy :P)as I suggested.  I'll play Mr. Rom and see what I think would be best fitting.Oh what is to be done with the level where Pre-trella comes to meet Ecco? The level's body is for 'the eye'and other levels have bodys that are used in the final version that have enemies and rocks that are indeed solid (that one future level where you swim therough rock)what is to be done with the level where you re-build the asterite and everything is all box-like?oh well....hmmmm where is the hex editor you are using?how do i edit sprites in an art program?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
We haven't decided on all the things we're going to edit so far. But yes, adding Music would be cool. I use XVI32 and GHEX (for Windows and Linux, respectively.) Tails151 uses Tile Layer Pro to edit graphics.

a guy from another board i go to described the 32x rom in detail of what it containts.Jagboy and I were talking about this ROM earlier today trying to figure it out but I just didn't think the bitrate of the video was around 500 KB/s.So I looked inside it and I found some things- The video data starts at offset x20000- At the end of the ROM there's 819232 bytes of junk (filler bytes, "FFFF FFFF FFFF", etc), starting at x237FE0. - The video resolution is 256 x 160So, that leaves us with 2195424 bytes which can possibly be video data. So, 2143 KB of video divided by 6 seconds = 357 KB.I think this is still a lot.So, my guess is that they just encoded a high bitrate video to make a nice tech demo. It wouldn't be as impressive if it was running at 150 KB. The evidence that points me in that direction is that:- There's 800 K of junk on the cart, so they weren't concerned about having to build big EPROMS (or maybe the junk was added later on by someone, by accident?)- It seems it's just a tech demo which was running at an Eletronics fair? So, since you don't have the data rate limitations of a CD, why not just beef up the video and make a nicer tech demo?BTW, I'm supposing the video ends when the filler data begins, but that might not be the case. There might be something between the end of the video and the junk data, so the video might be even smaller than 2.1 MB, but I doubt it.

o_o Wow. I must admit this has been a fun topic to read through. =D I remember having an Ecco dream once. It was kind of a long time ago, though. Let's see if I can remember it.Ummm...okay. I was at a friend's house and I was playing Ecco 3. At least I think that's what it was called. It was for Genesis and the graphics looked exactly like those from Ecco-ToT. Hrm. I think the game was called "Remember the Ocean". I don't remember what the plot was or anything, but I remember seeing Ecco in this green and purple sea attacking these...floating...furry orange things. And always in the background was the figure of a girl, swimming and following Ecco everywhere. o___o;;; I had this dream like...4 years ago though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
O_O Heeeeeey...I want some, too. *pouts*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hehe. My art teacher said that too. But she WAS a loony. I'm serious. o_o She made us call her "Dr." So it was always "Dr. Peters!" If we called her Mrs., she wouldn't answer.  Also, she used to make up stories all the time and tell them to the class. Not like, faerie tale stories. Things like...she'd tell us stuff that 'happened' to her and she would expect us to believe her. i.eSupposedly, she came home from work one day to find a man dressed in all black in her bedroom, stealing her jewelry and 'heirlooms.' So she grabbed her rifle and tackled him to the ground, shooting him in the arm and the leg. Then, she picked him up (I guess at this point he was unconscious) and threw him out the window into her pool in her backyard. She went out and checked on him and he was still alive. And, according to her, he asked her to go on a date with him.Hm. Don't you think we would have read about something like that in the paper or something? Also, she doesn't own a pool. She lives on the street right next to mine. o_o Odd. Very odd.

Ha ha! Hey Neko, welcome in. Looks like you fit just right with all the other weirdo's in here. :DI love cheese myself... In fact I remember in grade 8 when Jader appointed me the nick name cheese head. O_0;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh. My FFVIII dreams are pretty weird. o_o One of these days I'm gonna make a website just about my dreams. ...okay, maybe not. But they're pretty weird. c.c Anyways. Most of my FFVIII ones consist of me being dressed up like Edea. ._O And I always end up killing something. I remember once I killed Quistis. e____x I don't remember why. I think it was because she was just getting so damn annoying.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Bweee! *grabs her Vanilla Coke* &lt;3
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe. I have a couple nicknames involving cheese, as well. Nothing very creative, though. The main one would have to be cheesy. o__o That sounds funny.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
JADer!!!! Where did you come from!!?!?!?!?! HEYYY!!! E-me if you're at a computer! I wanna talk to you! I've never gone more then a day without doing that. 0.o;;; Crazy! Thanks though!And yeah... being 16 sucks major. 23 is my age. I want to be 23 and stay 23 forever. Well... not forever! But you know... I'm gonna have so much fun when I turn 23. MY YEAR!!!! MINE YOU HEAR!?!?Ah hem... yes. 18 would be nice too. Then I could hit the good clubs, if you know what I mean. ^_-
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sure, Doomy!  That'd be a neat addition!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sup Kit! Sorry about your computer. But you weren't gone that long were ya? Hmmm... well, I was busy for a while too so maybe I just didn't notice. But uh... welcome home!!! ^_-

<div id='container'>
Heh heh... well I have the first THREE scripted out already... it's the drawing that'll take forever. The first one is being drawn and then I'll color it up, and this show will be on a roll! But the coloring is what takes the longest. I'll get it done this summer, I promis! It'll just take a little longer because I'm entering a big art contest and I'll need to put some time into that too.In other CAD news... I've redisinged the site (yes again) much nicer this time. It's not up yet, but soon soon. I'd like to get it a little interactive too. I already have the poll (go vote!!!), but I'd like to do some more stuff too. I think I'll add a forum to my forum index for it... but that's not really what I mean. If you have any idea's on what kind of stuff I could do, let me hear em'!

I was playing that Betarom and did that b+c and start thing during the jumping intro to get that selecting menue and I warped to that intro but I was BLACK!  heh, Shadow is in the Beta rom (if i guess Shadow is a black dolphin)gmmmm think and ecco dream collection would make a good topic?sure there is fan fiction and such, but a rampent mind can do strange things.

Aw I missed it! Happy belated b-day DT!Driver's test...you mean you have to take one? o.oI'm 18 going on 19 and still don't have a license...haven't even taken the test yet.  It's because I hardly ever drove because I don't like driving.Well I kinda almost feel like I'm still 16.  In fact I'd almost rather it be that way.  Because then I wouldn't have to worry about going to college or have to think about when I'm gonna move out and what I'll do at that point.  After living with my parents for almost 19 years I'm just not sure I'm ready for that.  I think I'll wait another couple years at least.You know, I remember when I actually wanted  to grow up.

sorry for posting again.I did that B+C &amp; start thing to get access to 'move levels' when you select the demo 1 2 3 0 to watch "the dolphin show", by the Dolphin who says "i know where is the cave", there is an extra dolphin who dosen't talk but goes -somwhere-.Unlike the normal "follow me" dolphins this one is quite Neurtic.he'll also apper inbetween the opening to the pathway to the current and where that current is, follow it/him/her and this dolphin will take you for an nerotic dance.back and forth back and forth ect ect...then up and down, through the rocks (and dissapere off screen on the very bottom)it won't talk but pops up first above the "cave dolphin", ignore the dolpins need to dance with ecco and he'll swiftly go back to the starting place (either above "cave dolpin" or below those rocks)I took screen shots.Oh and I made ecco turn back via glitch....it's level 104 or somthing

I've had dreams about games that don't exist.  I even predicted one game and half-predicted another one.  I had a dream about playing Ristar like a year before it came out.  I pretty much forgot about the dream, but when I rented Ristar before I actually bought it, I thought the graphics and some of the characters looked extremely familiar, and the music was familiar too, and then I remembered dreaming about it.  Also when I used to read Animorphs (I only got about halfway thru the series) I dreamt about an Animorphs game.  I only recently discovered they made one for PSX.  I rented it, and I didn't see any levels like the ones in my dream, but I also didn't get very far.Now, Ecco.  I haven't actually had a dream about the games, but once last year I dreamt I was a dolphin swimming with a pod.  And I had a feeling it was Ecco's pod.  I seem to vaguely remember talking to the other dolphins.  I don't remember but I might have even  been  Ecco.  It wouldn't be the first dream I've had where I was a character from a video game or a cartoon.  LOL, once when I was little I dreamt I was Rafael from the Ninja Turtles.  He was my favorite of course.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I never even looked at it.is "copywritten" a word?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I didn't know there WAS an Ecco game for PC.

<br />

<div id='container'>
8? Dontcha mean 2? *glomps her DSL* &lt;3
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
okie-dookie. Here's the Ecco review from//www.geocities.com/doomstuff/eccoreview.jpgIt says on it that the game was featured in EGM #152. That wasn't too long ago... any body know anything about that issue? It's the issue featuring Maximo, March '02.

i have ages i have all of the stuff the read me asked for to play 32X but it just goes to the sega sign and dissaperes

Lightning is what fragged my Genesis controller. It was a good one too.I have a video tape: "At Frich, a man was struck by lightning." The guy with the camera is struck, falls on the ground, gets up, and keeps filming the clouds in front of him.Well, when it keeps its distance, I think its kinda cool.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh. Yea, seriously. Well, glad to hear everything's back in order, Kit! =D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The real world is boring, that's why we have this fake one here.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
All there is on that rom is an introduction nothing more.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol. Exactly, Artreus. The real world for me is VERY boring. Especially during summer vacation. -_- It's funny. All year we moan and gripe and whine for it to be summer, and then when it gets here, we can't find anything to do and we're bored out of our skulls. Puzzling, yes.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe. Neko.  My sister always told me that I smelled like an enchilada. o_o or a taco. She was obsessed with mexican food. She told other people they smelled like butt, so I guess I'm lucky she only said I smelled like an enchilada. c.c
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe. Ahhh, the ninja turtles. Such fond memories. I don't remember which was my favourite. o_o

o__o;;; I am so lost. What's going on? x.o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
indeed, the entrance to the dolphin soccer game is in the same hidden room as in the ps2 version; through the wall in the room with the clan general in "Powers of Levitation" where the power of stealth can be found. just charge the same light in the back where the soccer ball would have been found in the ps2 ecco and you'll be able to access the hidden game.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
aww...thats to bad. I would really like to meet some people who actually like ecco around here. everyone around here is either a gangster, or someone wanting to be a gangster. But, if it would be wierd..

Interesting observations! Home Bay (level 04) seems like it was just a testbed for the following system. Shall we call it the "Schizo Dolphin"? :)

I use XVI for Windows and GHEX for Linux. You can get XVI by searching google for:Download XVI WindowsBut I'm going to be uploading it to the site soon anyway, in a new section, Are you sure you edited the ROM and that wierd thing happened? Or did it happen on an unedited ROM? If you could send me the screenshots and your edited ROM (epicenter@adelphia.net), I'll take a look and find out exactly what you changed to cause that to happen, it could be useful.Thx!

SHADOW !!!!!! FOR WHOM DO YOU TAKE YOUSELF ?!?! I uploaded this program !!!!!!!!!!! YOU CAN'T USE IT WITHOUT MY PERSMISSION !!!!!!!!!!!! Eh? I'm just asisting in the spread of pirated software. You don't own any rights to that rar file anymore than anyone else here does.

<div id='container'>
Hmm....I need to study this rom more...I am still learning where things are and whatnot, but I hope to learn soon
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
stenellya whats the point of sharing files with people if they can't do as they wish with them? your getting mad if shadow adds them to his site but how do you think i feel?I share many files on the net and they appeared on other sites, but do i get mad? no! cause that was my intention. Some things people should have access to.But theres no point to this arguement the file doesnt belong to you and i can prove it. Lets just say i gave shadow my copy of ecco for pc. then what are you gonna do? get mad that he copyied your idea? Puh my advice just be proud you started a revolution. you are the first person to make that game open to the public. ;) and i think its a good thing you did. so dont blame yourself. even if you didnt do it someone else would have. so its not a big deal.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i got some pics of the beta version but where do i send them?

Ha!  No one is even aware that the fact that we have an Ecco 2 beta forum, some of this forum's participants, or this whole damn hacking revolution, wouldn't have happened if it weren't for me!  Now i i'm being forced to fuck around with "toning down" a revision of the ecco 2 beta file as though I didn't even create tha first one!  I will admit i gave it to deven int ha first place but i guess i counted on somethign a bit different to happen.... Youre whining means shit, compared to me, sten, and this is the first time i've complained about it!

Yeah if you put off updating that site for too long its goign to look like mine used to!By tha way hows 3.1 coming?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the ecco beta forum is its own community. and i have to say i like the way its ran. it even has some of its own members. after all, there are quiet a few who don't post anywhere else.I will admit histronic you awoken a sleeper known as the ecco 2 beta community. it has alot of potential. but if you talked to deven latley he said he was gonna do two betas. one was gonna be combined with the ecco final the other was gonna be a crazy game with cussing and you name it.Even if he doesnt do that i still have plans for my version of ecco 2 ;)By the way does anyone know who exactly was the first person in the ecco community to descover the beta?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
histronic i have to agree. when i was looking at this topic i was thiking the same thing.

What are the significance of the pics though? I don't understand what you what information on the site to associate them with. If you can tell me exactly what you did to get each of these, though, I'll post that. :)

My question is, does the Vortex have any weapons like laser rifles etc. In "The Library" the atlanteans says, that they were losing a war with the vortex. But an enemy without weapons is no problem. But, when they have weapons, why don´t they use them against ecco? And another reason for my question is, that the Vortex a high-technology species is. So they normaly have to have weapons! Maybe you can help me
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think most of the Vortex (and Foe) weapons are organic, they're inclusive in their body.For example, in Ecco DotF, one of the alien crawls on the ground and has a weapon; an organic and poisoned arm. He can launch it to catch and hurt Ecco.The Vortex from Ecco 2 also can send poisons to their ennemies.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What I want to know is why you never see a single Vortex in the Vortex Future. I know the Drones (Like the ones who took you there) can't survive the low pressure (Try taking them into shallow water in Dark Sea-They'll die)... But the others would live fine. In fact, I'd expect to find a bunch of larvae (Like in City of Forever).

there is a "follow me dolphin"  in the "floating glyphs level"it brings you to a 'magic arm'
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, Appaloosa looks like they went a bit overboard showing off the Following System. I suppose it was a new feature, I don't think you could follow other dolphins in Ecco 1, just have them follow you. I didn't know about the dolphin leading the Magic Arm, though, thanks! I'll document that on the site when I do my next big update (probably today or tomorrow.)

Yo Crestoe,I emailed you with an avatar request, just wondering if you got it.  I'm not trying to sound annoying or anything, it's just i was wondering if you got the request or not. Thanks for listening to this.

Yeah, good luck. You need a ton of it for finding rare items like that at affordable prizes.

<div id='container'>
Eh? They die? I never noticed that before. I must try it. About the vortex and weapons stuff, perhaps they are some type of ultramass-breed and there's no need to arm them due weapon costs and low value of a miserable drone's life.Of course, you can think then why don't you find more of them in the game...

I think I was busy with something else at the time. And somehow, even though I backed up all of my stuff, the files are nowhere to be found. Sorry. I could, however, tell you how to take your hard disk out of the other computer, install it into the one you're using, and get your files off of it.

Indeed. It was a more than decent thing. It had some cool spark on it.

I've posted three toolkits to the site for editing art, hacking the ROM, and investigating the ROM. You can find them at the following URLs (these will be on their own page sometime this weekend.) Each ZIP file is compressed to the max and about 1 MB. Each contains the Ecco 2 Beta ROM in BIN format. The artist kit includes TLP and the E2B Palette file. The hacker kit includes XVI32, the hex editor I used for the hex screenshots on the Hacking page, StealthPatch and SegaTool. The investigator kit includes GoodGen and XVI32.http//ecco2beta.2ya.com/kits/artist_kit.ziphttp)

Most of the posts here are off topic but that's ok. Maybe that explains why there 4 pages doomtrain  :)  Oh yeah, you gotta wait and see those picts! I'm thinking their going to be great

<div id='container'>
Hey...I just rented it and saw it again......and uh did any of you see the newist version?the timemachne here looks 'almost' like Ecco's and like the guy in the film there cannot be 0ne without the other. or somone or somthing at stake.The man's girlfriend dies, if she lived he would of never invented his machine, without the vortex and destruction Ecco and his time hoping would not exist as well.Also it got me to thinking of strange things...the past is still happning while his future actions are going on.Think of as reading the two of the same book, but 'backwards' (last chap to the first) and the one normal.  What is happning on earth while ecco is 10,000 years into the future?  and that 10,000 years could be one of two possible out comes, one with the vortex queen taking root in earth's present/future and one with her not or alredy escaped into the past and making anthropods (as Ed told us) So the vortex belongs here all along?If Ecco destroyes the Queen in the past then there would be a very small bio diverse world?if ecco is the stone that split the tides of time into 2, then would there be 2 eccos?  would the missing ecco 3 have this ecco and a vortex ecco?where Queenie V assilimates him and breeds a 'dark' dolphin to kill the true ecco that comes.....how would the Atlantians wart this?What if Trellia went into the past....or HOW did she?  and how does the future Asterite send Ecco back? (also how does he change colors and move all over the place..this also goes for the Beta)could the geography change so much?what do you think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Haha no ones called me hsitroic in awhile.  Basically its going to be a whole bunch of crazy stuff... its goign to be a completely playable version fo ecco 2, in tha regard that everyone tells you tha same thing, but just ina ghetto sort of way.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
....who are you? O_o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Once again peopel try to find a way to explain the story... dude, the vortex have no weapons!  I kind of think its related to the fact that ecco would look fucking lame shooting sonar at someone with an acid torpedo launcher.  Of course, ecco should have weapons too, but thats just a personal gripe.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah silverfin, i know.  Its just that the people here don't like a game unless you colelct experience points or theres subtle character development.

Haha tha hard disk is tha problem!  Oh well i'll just rewrite it again.  This time it'll be even better 8)

<br />

<div id='container'>
How's your hand? It grow back yet? Yeah, I started to wonder about where you went. Then I decided to cut it out. I think you're getting all of our water :x  It hasn't rained this side of NY for a while, but it's starting to come back now...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it almost esscaped my mind, but what is too be done with the 'dubble' levels?  how many balls does it take to build an Asterite (that wacky geometic level)and the "pre trelia" level, which is the eye's map shape.building the glyphs to relese a dolphin is cool.......but the level is taken for the eye (the body anyhow) should we tweek the game and use the golden/white/shadow dolphin that occurs in glitches come out of the glyphs?  What can we make schitzo dolphin do and the dolphin that is in the floating glyph level. (what is to be done to this as well) being in the future much cannot be done, because we'd have to make a trellia dolphin swim and jump and move and all that rot..let alone say somthing (it drags you to a magic arm)and um.....some useless levels that mimmic finished ones.oh and another thing! where are we/you placing the robot shark/dolphin? will he be gaurding the globeholder or the entire vortex base?

<div id='container'>
I've had similar thoughts (I think.)Interestingly enough I'm writing a story write now (Yes, yes, I write many stories) which has all the possiblities running into each other you go back in time and tell yourself to build a time machine, then you build a time machine and go back in time to tell yourself to build a time machine etc.  Time is confusing.

Unfortunately, we don't know how to do most of that yet .. if anyone can figure out how to edit level layouts, that would be awesome .. I suspect that the placement of items may be indicated by an (x,y) coordinate pair you see in the Debug Menu ..

That's one of the ones that survive lower pressure. The Drones (The brown ones, both types) die at a certain point of height... and also when taking you into the future. In the Beta, the one in level 16 doesn't go very far up, just starts to stay at a certain height, it seems, although I think I may have seen it higher once... I think this was the fix for palette issues that would arise from them being in the upper palette.Screenshot of one's death/explosion//members.cox.net/tails151/ecco2_005.gif

<div id='container'>
Time Travel is confusing... In the Ecco games, the Vortex Future is false. It is an impossibility, and if it had happened, the past wouldn't have. There is a finite past... If one travels back in it and changes it, reality will split in two, and when the one who changed it goes back to its previous time, nothing will change. The entire reality where Ecco does what he does requires the Queen's presence in the past... The Asterite continues a loop it started somehow...  The Asterite seems to be able to distort the flow of time, and was possibly how Trellia went back, where Ecco was grabbed by something like a temporal vacuum (Not the machine!) which pulled them into the area with a gap. In theory, Ecco was continuously on the verge of being pulled back to his present, requiring only a slight loosening of the future's hold, which the Asterite's Metasphere did.The Vortex essentially made it so that time went like he died right on the spot where he was taken... The Vortex have some time travel capability, but apparently only in the opposite direction from the Time Machine... Again, the future barely held Ecco, and the Asterite's globes broke him loose, pulling them back to the present.And apparently, the Asterite is good at movement. It just doesn't often because it is vulnerable while in transit.

I've got about 800 sprites total on my HD. I do too much downloading, but i love the little things. Like anime icons, game icons, buildings, and items. They're like mini digital possessions that are perfect as bullets on webpages or to be used as a graphical representation in an online roleplay.Currently I have these categories:AnimeGames and SpritesFoodsBumpercons (bumper sticker icons that I made, thinking of making summore but just a wee bit smaller tho)Items (love love love items!)And in the subcategory of Other i have..CutiesEtc (which are basically everything else that is misc., but in this folder i have tons of game backgrounds/scenery.)BuildingsAnimalsFantasy CreaturesSmilies and EmoticonsKodamas (those cute little things from Princess Mononoke)Web ElementsOrbsWings and ThingsKaosGame misc. (fan made game gifs, that aren't really official nor rips)-Well that's all.....I think. I am very picky about the kinds of gifs and sprites i pick out, so I assure you they are as best quality that I can find.So if you guys would like some I perhaps will consider making a web page to archive my collection.Love ya'll, peace.-spiderchan

Heh heh...my squirrel quote was said by me while talking to Tidesinger in chat one day. I was telling him all about the baby squirrels we rescued last year, and he said that he had a ton of squirrels, too. So I said, "I think squirrels are universal."Ah, OK, Sha, I'll burn it.

welcome back vantid. when you find the time register for postnuke. we now have art gallerys which you can maintain yourself. it also allows you to upload your own artwork. o.oanyways im glad your back!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
wow you sure have alot! i guess i know who to go to if i ever need any sprites.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh i never could get an interest for live journals probably cause i could have my very own live journal system on this site anytime i want o.o;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
im sure shadow didn't mean to. the guy can work nonstop through a day and through the night. i wish i could do that ._.; then again maybe i should start looking into the joys of cafiene (yes i know i spelled that wrong to lazy to look it up bitch o.o)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i'll look into it when i get time. to be honest we never added any new smileys. shadow might have but my guess is he didnt. alot of those new smileys your seeing came with the board and have been here all along. people just didnt know about them.I want to add some of the gay assed ecco smileys up since people like them. problem is id rather ramake the sprites. the ones blackfin made could be better, though i commend him that it was alot of work to do those.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
whoa kick ass! when i get some time im gonna have to start playing with these things o.o

Hey, I still can't beat the Megaman games for NES. o.o;;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
my bet is we need 68000 disassembler. if you get time id recomend look into it and use it. it wotn be that much code. especially if you know what your looking for. i'll look into it if i ever get the free time ._.;

I think the future's 'Trite is the past one's spirit. No, really. It looks like a ghost, hence the white and yellow ghostly colors.

I once disassembled the ROM into ASM. Looked like thousands of lines of code. Perhaps we could do something useful with it though. I'm not too familiar with that ... would there be text messages in the ASM code as well? I mean, where else would they have come from? :) If so, once we learn the format, we may be able to add messages to other dolphins and the Asterite, etc.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Nah, the ROM is completely self-contained. Basically, the way a ROM works is that there's an actual chip on a cartridge, which contains about 512k - 4 MB of data. The Ecco 2 Beta is a 2 MB file of all the data read from the chip. Since it's just raw data, it can't use files. GYMs are just music extracted by emulators from the games. Our best chance of editing music/sound is probably to get a disassembler and fiddle with the source code, or do a lot of Hexing. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You were talking seriously as I can see...Other of the "Impossible" games bites the dust.By the way, megaman games are not really hard... except the first one for the nes. I swear it, I was playing like a god and that yellow thing (that morphs to the other part of the screen) kicked my ass all the time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

Haha it took me forever to beat the final raptors in jurassic park.  And Radical Rex (who happens to look like me) had this boos that couldnt be hit.  It was bullshit.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
PsySonic observed that one of the levels in the Ecco 2 Beta is the "Silent Sea" from Ecco 1 for Sega CD. I am also convinced that Level 4, "Home Bay", is a completely different level from the one in the Final, it's designed nothing like the final one. It seems more like a testbed for the following system than anything! Two dolphins try to get you to follow them, and then there's even some turtles swimming around. I think this level was just meant to be a test for all sorts of things.But anyway. Does anyone know what any of the levels in E2B came from (Ecco 1) or became (Ecco 2)? I'll post any confirmed findings on the site. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Tha asterite had bland colors because he was an old mothafucka o_o  If he was suppsoed to eb a spirit or somethig hippie liek that, they would have told us.Don't even talk about tha dark dolphin because since he wasn't in tha final, he never actually happened!And finally, it was a genesis game.  it didn't have to make sense.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
All eccos excpet ecco 2 and dotf did that for me
</div>

<div id='container'>
I made a Ecco dream this night...I was playing a strange Ecco game, with passage full of crabes, falling rocks, etc. and no surface.In the other part of the game, I was swimming close to a octopus, but it was a female, and babies went out of the eggs. I had to kill them.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah I though we'd have to take it completly appart and almost re-write it.Like In Jurassic park....when they remade the dinosaurs with frog DNA...it's almost the same
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the sea of silence is in Ecco 2 beta!?i never got to play the sega cd....the only way to see if ecco 1/CD levels are in this beta are from sonar maps....being emulator-less I hear one would need a TV card (have one) and a sega CD with ecco.up my TV and "puter are 10 or so feet away from each other....which would call for a hugeass ugly wire connecting the two.at my other house the TV stand and table with the 'puter were very agasient.I hope we can get an extencion cord up...we purchased the damn thing and now I canno't use it.

I know Level 1 is Globe Holder (Duh.)... Level 3 became Two Tides.... 0 and 10 resemble Asterite's Cave (The future one)... 6 became The Eye in idea, not map...7 became Skyway and Skylands... 8 is unrecognizeable. 9 is unrecognizable as well, but would fit a level, if it had objects besides the Glyphs... 11 is Tube of Medusa... 12 is Vortex Arrived (Text level)... 13 is Moray Abyss... 14 is City of Forever/ TMachine (Level 48 in the final)... 15 is one of the Vortex Future levels... 16 is Lunar Bay/Dark Sea... 17 is Vortex Queen (Duh!)... 18 is an unspecified good future level.

Hi Vantid! :D

w00t! It worked!  Eao, you live in Foo Jersey, too? I'll mail a copy to ya. Just gimme a PM!

For the Artist Kit, just get Tile Layer Pro from http New version of palette. Works for basically all the uncompressed tiles, but not exactly the correct colors (i.e. brown instead of green for Vortex Queen, must change 1-2 of the blacks to fit). Note the sprites from Ecco 1 for the past enemies, and the Vortex-ling sprite from Ecco1)

Thanks to Sten and Shadow, I was able to get a copy of Ecco PC. I noticed something - the PC version uses nearly identical Ecco 2 version's Ecco sprites!  Now I'm not sure when the PC game came out, but I know E2 came out in '94. If the PC version came out before that, it may just be possible that EPC is a stepping stone between E1 and E2!

<div id='container'>
Yea, I know what you're saying. I like romance and stuff, so that's mostly why I like Sailor Moon so much,  but you need a break from it once in a while too. That's why there's so many other anime to turn to. =D (Cowboy Bebop being one of my very favourites) Bweehee.

The first TEN episodes are all scripted out, the first TWO are drawn, and episode 001 is in the coloring process and will be out this week!!!!I'm actually really exited myself, because this is my THIRD stab at the damn thing and it's finally ready to go!

Hm. Yea, it does. o_o In my dream, Ecco was in a passage with crabs and falling rocks (except they were orange and fuzzy o_o) and there was no surface either.  It was pretty strange, too. c.c

Hello everyone it's me again. I'm considering making a website or forum entitled Pangean Seas. It'll be a marine oriented site for the dolphins or creatures of the prehistoric world ecco once visited. If anyone would like to help pitch in and create the storyline, characters, and/or host me please let me know in this post. I can do art and web design, and submit my ideas on a few concepts as far as the site.Well, thank you for your time. I hope I'm not posting here too much to make me seem as if i have no life.. lol ^_^ But to be honest I check the forum everyday, just like I check my email.My best wishes to all of you, ja.

<div id='container'>
Haha it took me forever to beat the final raptors in jurassic park.it took me the same "fucking forever" O-o, only... I used "refill ammo" cheat.I never beat the final "Grant".  I moved Ecco toward some kinda "weedy" net, and I heard the usual sound I call "Water-Tube pop".In my 2nd dream, the usual stuff.... This time it feels like the "Gravitor Box"-like level with the same -tubeofmedusa- music and when I accidentally exited one tube, the gravity pulled me UP.In all those dreams above I had the feeling of Ecco TOT. (more of a "sequel-like" type.)

That's one of the ones that survive lower pressure. The Drones (The brown ones, both types) die at a certain point of height... and also when taking you into the future. In the Beta, the one in level 16 doesn't go very far up, just starts to stay at a certain height, it seems, although I think I may have seen it higher once... I think this was the fix for palette issues that would arise from them being in the upper palette.Screenshot of one's death/explosion//members.cox.net/tails151/ecco2_005.gifI never seen this pic....

<div id='container'>
Well, I'd like to get into my stories and characters and stuff, but I won't because it'll take too long.

I hate remakes and ports of old games. The only way I'll buy a remake is if it has multiple games on it. (e.g. Smash Pack, Sonic Jam) I'm boycotting single game remakes in a hope to get new games... but it doesn't seem to be working. :( If it was a new Ecco game, I'd buy it. But a remake...

Teknoman had something like that. The bad guys kidnapped a few people and turned them into Teknomen. The main character, Slade, escaped with the help of his father, who soon dies. His greatest enemy is a teknoman that was his brother and his sister later dies because she didn't become evil. All I need to know about anime I learned from Teknoman.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i can kinda agree with that. sometimes when they make remakes they can tend to ruin the oriignal game. That and you know too much what to expect.

hey hey hey....i was gonna close it i just wanted to ask crestoe. but...before we close it lets take this thing off the top of the list.

If you need an avatar or something, preferably an anime or furry face I can find you one or make you one.

I have about 6 books on dinosaurs, of all eras, including lots of pictures, as well as 2 books on palaentology. Did you know that the Icthyosaurus looked like a dolphin but was a fish.

alright prepare to laugh and look down upon in contempt  ahem I just recently discovered the wonder of roms, no dont start laughing yet, and remembered this wonderful game from my childhood called ecco, ah the memories, and causally heard something about an ecco 2 and become frantic with the need to play the game(and i have discovered there is more than just 2 eccos, oh the wonders never cease, anyways i download the ecco 2 and i begin playing, all the wonderful memories of echolocatoin and speedy little bursts of swimming goodness and basically how to play the game came back to me, and i was going merrily along...oh god how did this become a narrative?..this plea has gotten out of control...well as i was saying because i might as well finish this dreadful story...i was going merrily along, until i come to a point for which i can find no way out of. the crystal springs, only the third bloody level, sonofabitch., i am a loser, getting past self pity i will now askCrystal SPrings in ecco 2? i echoed, and swam in circles aroun, and speared them as if they were a vicious bastard shark,all the crystal things i could, swam around the crystal that the other dolphin showed me,(the only helpful advice he offered was 'DO IT' and believe me i was rather annoyed becuase i want to do it, i just dont know what the well it was i was supposed to do--the rocks were/are  still at the entrance dammit. and i know its the entrance because when i do that 'wow look i can make  a map' echo magic it shows me a nice little arrow at that point.       so thats my bloated question with all my clever/annoying side notes along with it. ----Erisian Serendipity

All right, the trick is to push the glyphs with your sonar. The just shake back and forth, so just before the turn back you hit it again, making it swing farther and fall down. Use your sonar to push all of the glyphs to the point of light down at the bottom of the level.

Icthy is fish, so an ichtysaurus is a fish lizard. National Geographic, November 2001 has an article on the eviloution of whales, including pictures of the early species from hoofed to finned.

<br />

<div id='container'>
(just going to add a bit)yeah, like he said..push the glyphs. they'll vibrate back and forth...try to get them going at the same time as your sonar..ehh...its hard to explain, but you'll figure it out. then at the bottom of the level (left hand side) theres a glyph floating (or is it just a little star? i cant remeber) bring all the glyphs there. then you get a song. go to the bottom-ish left part of the level and theres is a line of rocks. sing to them and they explode. then exit the level.boo yeah, its been awhile since i played ecco 2, im glad i rembered that. crystal springs was my fave level (since i never dared to go past two tides 0_0; stupid scary vortex drones...oh but now i find them oh so cute *snugs one* hehe o.o)

ichthyo- fish, -saurus lizard.Pretty neat for early thunniforms.Not suprisingly they bear similarities to many other forms of large pelagic marine life.

sigh.....okay I did what you guys told me i really did. I sonared the glyph good. it was going all over the place, and i was pushin' it too. iwas attacking it, sonaring it....but there was no falling.....thank you trellia for the vote of confidence, but  i did not figure it out. well with the last shred of my diginity when it comes to gaming i say.... more help?

why dont you ditcyh that level find the code to the next level and work from there :D

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmm...I'll try and explin my method as best as I can in words.  :? Don't keep hiiting the sonar button really fast. Take it slow. Hit the button in a beat - like, for example. A *pause* A *pause* A *pause*. Eventually, the glyph will shake and fall, then you just sonar it to the point down at the bottom of the level. Hope that helps. ^^;

<div id='container'>
Rofl. I like malls. Dispite the security guards. =D I have many fun shopping at the mall stories. Like...dropping full cups of soda over the rail on the top floor...and...you know how they have those cars in the mall where you can enter to win them? Yea. it hit that and splattered all over the place. Needless to say, I bolted outta there pretty fast. Hehe. It was fricken hilarious, though.

heh, that reminds me. In a class in my school, students had to take home an electronic baby for a day. It would cry and you have to shove a card in its back to make it shut-up. And people would take them in the mall wrapped up in a blanket, and scream at the thing when it cried. Imagine a 15 year old girl yelling at a acreaming blanket in the mall. :)  Several heads turned that day.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Lmao, Artreus!! I had to do that!! O_O It wasn't fun. The stupid thing cried during the middle of the night. I am so NOT having kids for a very long time. x_x Yea. I had to take it everywhere. Baaaaaaaaah. I would never do that again.

My only two games were Ecco and FF7, and I had to go off and finish them. Still a lot to do in each, so its not too bad.

<div id='container'>
You should play Final Fantasy VIII. (eight, for thsoe of you who are confused with roman numerals) Bwee! I love that game! That is like...wow...the coolest game ever. (In my opinion anyways) Besides Ecco the Dolphin, of course. *nod nod*

The key is the speed of the glyph. If you hit it when it is moving away from you, it goes faster. If you hit it while it moves toward you, it goes slower, killing your progress. When it goes fast enough, it falls off its little gravity track and you can just push it with your sonar. I remember this level stopped me when I first rented the game. Then it was... Trellia's Bay? I forget...

<div id='container'>
Yes the Icthyosaurus was an aquatic reptile that was found by a little girl, though i cannot remember her name. See... I use to have a ton of books about Prehistoric animals and animals alive today but they became the victims of spring cleaning. seesh.... last time I ever leave the house...  Anyways, Spiderwing, are you collecting all sorts of stories from different people or a combination? Because I devolping a story that takes place in the prehistoric era. She is a aquatic dragon type combination, thinking about naming her Karnaim. What do you (and everyone else think)?

Uhm.. heh heh.. heh ^_^0 it seems that most my books have dissapeared or don't contain info on prehistoric marine life.Sure I'll need a little help. So that i can draw correct anatomy, species, and all that jazz. But Pangean Seas won't be entirely accurate, sure there'll be some fanciful characters that are made up and whatnot, but I'm talking about backdrop creatures. But like in Ecco when they had species evolved a million years ahead of what they were swimming with.I'm also thinking of having a section dedicated to the really prehistoric and  section to those that fill the gap between the destruction of the dinosaurs and rise of intelligent man. Because if you think about it. If the land creatures were destroyed and most of the entire earth was water, what about the marine life that HAD survived the first apocalypse? Maybe during this time was the first contact between humans and dolphins?..You know what's scary though? Sharks the size of whales.... I'm thinkin of putting that in there too. I mean they could eat 3 dolphins and it'd only be a mini meal for them.

But I only found 2 ..I'll email em to you though, they're pretty nifty!Oh yea and Doomtrain.. I know about psyguy. Some of my sprites came from there.. hehehe, Oh yea and I took yours too Trellia.. Just so that I could get em spread around the net. more people should like ecco, besides you can't find any good sprites these days. Good job on em! I'll give you the credit of course, as well as every other place i took sprites from. Even though I don't remember em all.. That's over 100 places to remember*blows a kiss*Waitin anxiously for your next reply peeps!

like I said, In the e-mail I'm prolly gonna have to make themthanks to you I have a whopping 3!one says it's from a game, it's file was calles "orphen game" which I strange because the only orphen game there is, is the PS2 one.hmm I feel dirty taking over an alredy existing sprite....thinking i'm somthing great compells me to make my own, but Photoshop wants me to make sprites in rbg color....so MS paint has to do.

Yaaay! Another cheese- :) lover!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Go to View&gt;Format&gt;Genesis, then start scrolling down. You'll start finding some sprites, 8x8 squares at a time. That's the difficulty with doing the graphics in the ROM, you have to figure out where the pieces go first, except in cases where it's put together nicely for you (Like the dead Torizo in Tourian in Super Metroid...). Typically, for the actual sprites, the tiles go vertically, like this:15263748I'll post offsets and some pictures later.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ugg....e-mail me for what animals you want. I have a book on dead thingsi can get you some fish and sharks and whales and seal thingsBasilisaurs is a whale, it has 'useless' flippers that aren't attached to it's body, it is long and snake like and had few teeth compared to normal mamals today.it was 30 feet long, it's name means "kind lizard", for when discoverd in AFRICA's sahara desert it was thought to of been a sea serpehtTethies, they mentioned you on TV last nigt *laughs*they say it "teth-ease"like how I think the word is said.too bad your ocean is Africa now
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Talas, all you need is an emulator and the ROM... www.zophar.net has a bunch of emulators. For Genesis, Sega CD, and 32X, I'd suggest getting Gens from their Windows/Dos page under Genesis.Oh, and Shadow, I've got more respect for the person who made Gens than the one (or many) that made DGen. But then again, DGen was one of the first ones to run Sonic 2's 2 player mode correctly, so it's still a nice piece of work.

What is it with art teachers and being crazy? You become an art teacher, you go nuts. Well... Doomtrain's art teacher sounded crazy, anyway. Mine, she was nice. But she had two last names (I dunno, she was Ukranian) and so no one could figure out which to call her by. So she was like "Yeah, you can call me Master Schile, if you want..." she even had that embroidered on her art coat... she was funny!Anyways... yeah, Kit, I like the one of Usagi! It looks very purty with the background. And Team Rocket kicks ass! Wooo!

Hello again, i'm sure you will al be pleased to know that i have conquered the crystal springs!!! woohoo. thank you, thank you.okay now i need help again, well not so much help as maybe a tip. or a hint or something... the medusa thing how does one get past this monster? its faster than me. sonaring does not  keep it away enough. is there a trick, or do i just keep going till i get lucky? this is so great the novelty of having a place to go get help. and all you nice people actually helping me. well i'm off..oh do you get those cool movie scenes in ecco 2 like you did in the original ecco?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The medusa is the mst annoying part of the game really. Theres no way past except for twitch reflexes and brute force. Basically just jam as fast as you can for the exit.

Tha reason you never see pod sentinels is because by tha time somoen gets up to a normal amount of posts, arkon changes tha forum.

Eh? where did I say anything about DGen other than maybe in reference to the fact that right now its really the only emulator available on MacOS.That said, Gens and Kega are both excelent emus, from the compatibility/operability standpoint. I don't subscribe to the whole emu scene politics to know anything about the developers.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You got to tha flying medusa already?  It took me two years to get past tha second part of two tides.  But i was young and an idiot.Tha medusa is a bastard, plain and simple.  Just swim like a mothafuck and you should be okay.  However, since you're probably using a keyboard, you'll find this to be tougher than it should be.  So I'm goign to give you something that can actually help you.Turn ecco so he is pointing toward tha screen (just as long as he isn't facing directly left or directly right) and press abc bc ac ab  Tha level that's supposd to come after that is Fin to Feather.

<div id='container'>
Well someone should fucking upload them. o_o

<br />

<div id='container'>
Ain't got nuttin but love for anyone who's involved in emulation.And seriosuly, what did you expect?  Of course its a port.  I made a post in tha Ecco 2 forum about what probably happened to make us not have an ecco 3, and it's probably tha same thing that put old Ed out of business.  After he was declared child eatingly insane and shipped off to wherever, Ecco died.  And DOTF was not an ecco game.

Good question. My PC version has no music, and crashes everytime a Glyph movie is finished playing. :?Uninstall the program, "engrave" it (put it on a CD), and re-install it.The program will be able to take the music and the films from CD, so it will work perfectly !

While I agree that FF8 is a nice game I would have to say I enjoyed 9 more. But yes, Ecco is still king......though what they want for it here in ZA is rediculous! To buy a brand new copy of Ecco DOTF costs around 700 bucks! 8O

The charging one is one of the ones that stuns the Drones... The level is Dark Sea, by the way. It works in Lunar Bay, too. It's actually easier to do there, since there are so many Drones there that aren't being sonared... Even a few right below the depth they come apart at.And the reason is definitely a palette glitch if they were to be near the surface. You can see that if you swim high enough for the sky palette to appear while a piece of a Drone is onscreen.

You know, before i got that game, i was expecting realistic blood and such since tha graphics are so good.... not having blood where it's appropriate brings down tha visuals, if you ask me.

Well I did draw a picture of myself and I'd show it but I'm having problems with Side 7.  I'd post it on my website but it's Tripod and so that won't work.  I haven't been able to view my archive on Side 7 for weeks, but everything else was fine until now.  Now the whole damn site doesn't work except for the sidebar and the log-in page.  Guess it must be down or something.

I have Vantid's sketchbook.   And I'll have to retain it a while longer. I have three pages left to fill, and Neo's swamped with two books already and welcomes the idea of not having two more added to the pile (Van's and mine).

you don't know how pleased i am to hear that, swifty ;)i shall notify you, eao, when i am prepared to send out trellia's and cally's sketchbooks to you so i can get your address. however, due to my financial restrictions, i may have to send them out one at a time... but i shall try to get at least one book out to you before swifty sends the next two books to me.

i usually enjoy chatting on AIM as well, since i do it more often then attending the chats here at #darkseas these days...one of the best ways i've found in obtaining people's AIM screen names from this forum (or at least those who are willing to give out their screen names) is by checking to see if the individual has the little AIM buddy icon down near the bottom of their profile, clicking on it would instantly pull up an AIM window with the person's screen name on it so that you could chat with them or even save it to see if they are on later... that's how i first came into contact with trellia and arkon, the first people i had ever spoken to who were affiliated with this site.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Haha... Why would Arkon feel a tad bit threatened by me? I don't even know how to build a fricken website. So don't worry!    Though I do agree with Artreus....  Noriko has not been on that long and look at all her posts... I would be a tad bit deranged and would have to run away in panic. :)

Well I found out the name of that ugly dog-dolphin creature and it is known as a Mesonyx. I also found a good time line that starts with Pakicetus and ends up with the modern whales and dolphins. Even River dolphins... ever seen those things? So strange looking.....

o.O Whutchu got against it, Arkon? Heh. Juuuuuuuuust kidding. Um yea. Well, her art was the first thing I went to when I first visited Arkonviox.com (back in the day). It's just my favourite. =D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
As I was looking throught his site, I noticed a page in which Arkon was wondering about the runes that is found in Atlantis. Yes, they do indeed resemble Tolkien's own runes but they also resemble another set of runes as well. These Runes were used by the ancient Scandinavians and other Germanic People. I recognized one of the Runes as an o and another a d, so I'll try to translate it and I'll see what I get.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
She's a popular one. That's the weight of the charisma.

<div id='container'>
One of my first thoughts as I played this game was why would those two drones take you to the Vortex Future in the first place? If I can recall, the last of the Asterite's globes was there, so why would those two drones help send Ecco to their future? Just a curious thought....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Woah. Pretty cool, Atolm. o_o I wonder what you'll come up with...?

I have an account too on aim. And I use to connect it, but never  used it to talk. I center my chats on msn, irc or icq.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Iv'e also noticed those ruins and had tried to translate the sybols from the game into words with the runes from that book. The only word that was in english though was the word "HELP" and after that it got all mixed up. I'm really eager to find out if you turn up anything about it. Good Luck!!

If we are all having requests for sprites, then I have two simple ones. Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy Tactics. I'm a bit of a retro gamer and plus the Lancer class in tactics is just so cool looking! Oh yeah, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Anybody ever heard of that one?

<div id='container'>
I'm thinking there was supposed to be a mean thing in the area they bring you to... But it died, inexplicably. Either that, or they thought Ecco wouldn't be able to escape....Why are there no Vortex in the Vortex Future? It looks... abandoned... except for the other creatures and any devices left behind...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's so sad,they could just move the whale faaaar away from the shore....and that whitefin dolphin was sad too. For more info on the Whitefin dolphin, click here  //www2.newpaltz.edu/~rowe22/#5.com

perhaps the vortex in the vortex future are dying; thus falling into general disrepair. We're informed in one of the prologues somewhere that the vortex aren't a self-sustaining race.

<div id='container'>
Maybe its Zaire.  And defender of tha future is worth like 20 bucks.  Unless you go to fuckign gamestop.  Then an old one is like 40 dollars.

<div id='container'>
Yeah thats what i was going to say.... tha vortex fucked it up so they left, leaving those weird ass globes behind.  Though there is a strange larvae in tha vortex future that doesnt show up anywhere else.

Tolkien probabyl took a few of his runes from a real language so looking at real languages is probably tha right thing to do.

blackfins made a comeback to the web it looks like. he started a new website with archives of all his works. if anyones interested he put up an archive of the undercaves. I been relunctant on puttting this up cause i didnt think anyone would care but im probably gonna contact him again.heres the url to the undercaves archive. the udnercaves was the first true ecco community.it grew to 50,000 hits. before it closed.http://undercaves.aileronnoir.com/It was the highlight of cavernsofhope.com's update.

Hee hee. Thanks, Neko. No I didn't draw it on my compy, just colored it with PaintShopPro. ^^

Why not make an "Evolutionary tree" featuring all the looks this site has gone through, ans well as the Undercaves in order, and put it on the Site Arkon?

<div id='container'>
Just a last little thing...The "name" of the CD can be important. When you "engrave" the CD of Ecco PC, you must enter this name for the CD: PB

LMAO!! XD I shoulda saved my message to Lizza.  Starting with Mefusa.A long time ago, my good pal Tidesinger came up with this Battle Forum, where he'd usa a crazy system to battle the forum members. He created a Medusa Battle Forum (one where the giant medusa from Ecco 2 could interfere) and made me in charge of it. Well, I typed up a fight and posted it. I looked it over and realized that I had accidentally typed "Mefusa" instead of "Medusa." I thought it was hysterical, so I named the Medusa that. It was now named Mefusa the Medusa. XDSquirrles.During a chat session with Tidesinger, I was talking to him about all the squirrles we had, and how we even had to rescue some baby ones. He told me that over in England he had a lot of squirrels, too, so I said "I think squirrles are universal."Spitty!This was one of my replies to a post Tide had said. Something along the lines of ramming kudos down my throat. XD So I replied with "Spittylicious!"

Whitefins Dolphin is its own species called "Thira Totara", but im guessing the looki of it had something to do with that dolphin.You brainless fools, if it had been a Whitefin dolphin it woulda been all fuzzy! ^^

Ah... understanding these runes is a bit strange. One rune symbol actually means one word, and I translated a three symbol Rune, the results were strange. The first symbol meant Ansuz, which means Gods of wind and the bringer of storms.  The second one, Odila, is known as to inherit the land, that also includes inheriting history or legacy. The last one is Eewaz, or a yew tree. The yew tree, back in the ancient days, was the bringer of life or death, since it grew from a sapling and into a tree, and whose wood can be turned into posionous arrows and thus bring death. Anybody want to try this in sentence form? Anyways, this is what I got from just one set, I'll try the bigger sets later on today. Yes, Eoraptor, I'll help you. E-mail them okay?  :)

Dang!  I was forced to find another copy of Ecco PC sonce the ftp os no longer working, I found one but it is only 125.4 MB, I'm not even shure it will work. Where else can I find it?

<br />

<div id='container'>
ooookkkk....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Not a sentence...a story.The "gods of winds" is the tornado that steals Ecco's family. Ecco is the Odila - he "inherits" the legacy, also becoming it. The yew tree is the vortes, which comes and tries to destry the earth.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Black Jack? I think it is about a free lance surgeon or something like that. Not quite sure, I'm too lazy to pick up the series. Has anyone seen the Escalfowne movie yet? You would not believe what is happening. I bought the ultimate edietion set, which came in a huge box, and Iwas planning to watch it later. I get a phone call from a friend complaining that his did not work. I thought little about it. Minutes later, I got another phone call from another friend, saying her's did not work as well.... Well.... I turned on my computer to give it a test run and lo and behold... mine did not work either, in fact, it froze my computer. So all three of us went back to suncoast and thus began the long search of searching copies that did work. The result? Out of two cases, only two worked, and there were three of us. Well, my friend said that he would be the gentleman and let us two ladies have the two working copies, he will have to wait a little longer for his copy. Has anyone else heard of this defect?

That uses a different set of letters called katakana. Hiragana, which is what I used for Callista's name, is used for Japanese words; katakana is used for foreign words and such. So wolf would be URUFU.

I've just gotten a new computer just a few weeks ago, a Gateway.  And now I'm having problems viewing stuff that uses Java script.  Or something like that.I'll try to draw something on an oekaki board and it asks me to download something called "Java Virtual Machine".  It does that also with the PaintChat and whenever I try to view animations on the oekaki boards.  Also there was one other site with a page with four images and I could only see two, and it also asked me to downlaod the same thing.  Without it I can't view these things.Now before when I tried to download this Java Virtual Machine it would say the components cannot be downloaded at this time, or something like that.  Now it does start to download, and in fact it gets to about 99% or so within less than a second (I have cable access, it says 1 minute which is probably if I still had a modem).  But then it seems to get stuck and it doesn't go any further.  Even after an hour it still doesn't do anything.  This is with AOL.I tried once to access the oekaki on IE and when it asked me to download this Java thing I hit okay and it seemed to work.  But then I got a thing that said it can't be automatically installed or something.  I'm going to go and look at exactly what the message says and then I'll post it.

This is what the dialouge box says that pops upJava virtual machine(checkbox) never download any of these components(download) (cancel)Here's what it says while downloading 3 KB     Download Time httpWe're sorry.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes! ^_^ I always wondered if she was nice (I always assumed, though) so it's cool that I got to find out once I finally(!) signed up for the forums. *nod nod* heh. She's gonna come back and read this thread and be like "whaaaaaa?"

Ah come on Neko, I'm sure it wasn't that bad! I'd like to see! And I can't wait to see your's either Sten! Oh, and Teth too! When it's working.And hey, Nori! You don't have to send a full body pic, just tell me what you'd like to have on, that's all! You can send a profile over this way: doomtrain23@hotmail.com I'll get on it ASAP, but member...

<div id='container'>
thats very interesting. yeah i found out about that a while back. im glad you were able to translate them and kitnee thats probably what it means. i'll update the interesting things section to carry this information.

BWEEEHHHEEEHHEEEE! yay! Okie dokie! I'll send it on over as soon as I can, Doomy! And don't worry about being slow. hehe. I am too. ._. Sorry to hear bout that, Swifty! =[ I just know yours would've been awesome!

Everyone's a slow ass, including me. That's too bad swift!!  But I was wondering why you would need a tablet when you can draw on paper.....anyways I'm stupid so forget I asked.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
its me again....okay i just straight up and skipped the medusa thing. thanks though..now time to ask once again for help(catching the trend, its probably going to continue) al right here goes it...im at the the astrelite's cave.. and when i go in and see him and he tells me about blah blah and so forth, which by the way i'm i'm confused about. he wants me to go save his life, which means that he was killed but if he was killed how is he in the future? and what happened to the cool videos like in Ecco 1? i got some cheesy vortex head bouncing around instead...i was disappointed. but the future dolphins are cool so i guess that makes up for it. ..wait wait none of those were the questions i wnated to ask..ahem..after  the asterlite goes on his spiel what am i supposed to do? i'm stuck in the cave with no air and he doesnt do anything to help me so i eventually die from a lack of oxygen....and i dont think thats how its supposed to go so.....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Had it been Whitefin's dolphin, I think they would be more concerned with its existance over its death. Some information on the Pilot Whales stranding:In July 2000, 10 pilot whales were stranded in shallow water off Nantucket Island. They died despite the efforts of volunteers and whale experts.On Christmas Eve 1991, 31 pilot whales became stranded off Cape Cod and died. What I don't have to quote, but was mentioned later, was the last of the Whales died near Blackfish Creek. The creek was given the name after 1,500 Pilot whales beached there in the 1800's.

Yea, Trellia's heading over to my weather. Well have fun.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You head up above the asterite and swim down between the two globe strands. If you hit the globes, he kicks you back out because he doesn't really want you to save him. Well, beneath him is a cave with a thing that takes you somewhere.

<div id='container'>

I'm glad to help out Arkon! :D  This is the lastest one. It is seven runes long. The words are the following, Ansuz (Gods of Wind), Odila, (to inherit), Lauguz (The water that reflects the sky and mirrors the calmness or ferocity of the wind that flows over it.) Uruz (An ancient name for a powerful extinct ox. It seems that if one was to prove himself, he would destroy or defeat this powerful foe.) Gebo (to receive a gift and give in return. Basically, an exchange in forces), Elhaz (protection) and then Uruz is the final one. This would probably mean that the gods of wind ( Vortex) seek to inherit the sea. Ecco, would need to back into the prehistoric era to retrive the missing globe from the asterite, but he must battle him to do so. After giving the asterite his lost globe, he gives Ecco the power needed to defend the seas against the Vortex. Anyways that is my first thought. Any other ideas?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Lord of the rings is a very good book! Right now I'm reading The Simrillion and it is very interesting! In the case of books, I would recommend The Hitchiker's Trilogy, The Chronicals of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door,and A Swiftly Tilting Planet. The Left  Behind series is quite good, (you dont have to be religious to enjoy it.) For harder readings, try the Iliad and Beowolf. If you are into ancient military history, try Gates of Fire, it deals with the Spartan battle at Thermopylae.

Java Virtual Machines and AOL don't play along real well.You probably need to run Windows Update to install the JVM. Because you have Windows XP, its not preinstalled.If that doesn't work you need to head over here//java.sun.com/getjava/download.htmlIts slow, but it works.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Neko - It has to do with photoshop often being a superior tool to pencils/markers for artwork thats going to be displayed on a screen. Low-end scanners don't do so well with getting colors/textures right and often blur or artifact fine details.Swift - What happened to your stuff?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah basically like Artreus said. Time your tapping of the C button to the speed of the globes, its pretty constant. when you get to the bottom you'll exit to the next stage.As for the asterite being complete: As Trellia said, this is the "good" future. Theres a "good" future and a "bad" future. You'll travel to the bad future later in the game. The asterite aparently can span planes of space/time, as seen in Ecco 1 as well. (in fact from a technical standpoint, the plot in ToT is not much different than the plot in Ecco 1)Yes, the cinematic of the vortex smashing the asterite sucked, but it made a funny idea for a comic skit i never finished. Ask me about it some day and I'll tell you.

Okay this forum has been kinda lax about moderation, but thats going to change effective now. Earth Clan is supposed to be a serious discussion forum, and right now its not. In fact it looks a whole lot like the O/T forum.New rules, enumerated:1) Posts on topic with EC only please. ie, requests for info, suggestions to steering committee, files and info that shouldn't be seen outside EC. Posts that arn't on-topic will get moved, deleted, or locked as seen fit by the administration. 2) In accord with the first rule, no more "Look at me I'm here" posts. 3) Topics should stay on topic, and not stray off into the world of one-line spam posts. Posts that cause this will be deleted or split.4) Posts that contain no text will be deleted on sight.Thats really it for now. I won't hesitate to censure users that violate these basic rules, with fair warning of course.

Well, the first time you sent in a translation, it looked to me like meaningless babble. But, some of it matched elements of the game, which Kitnee then put together. The last one makes sence in the same way working figuratively as opposed to literally.

i don't see the e-mail.sm....I have a font called "elder funtak" a runic font....some 'letters' are dubbled, hitting shift will make up runes face down.runes also mean differnt things too.  I don't know if the SSOrphen runes accutaly say anything or not but they call them "sorcerous letter"so, we have the story in a mythical metaphorical way?ecco inhertes what?  the asterites power.  where is the asterite in the story.what does the ox symbolize?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm going out on a limb here, but maybe the ox is the evil Asterite of the past? Ecco needed to defeat it in order to get the good Trite's globe, who then gave Ecco power (exchange of powers).

<div id='container'>

If you wanna see what Flash is truly capable of go to this site//www.ninjai.com/index.htmlThis is the best use of Flash I've ever seen! The animation is great, the music is great, the voices are great, and even the story is really good.  This would make a great anime!And then if you want a laugh check out this sprite comic//www.nuklearpower.com/comic/archive.htmIt's really funny!  Better than That's My Sonic, IMO. A spoof on RPG's.

Whaaaat? I didn't say anything was spelled wrong.  I was asking an honest question, not being sarcastic.  I honestly was uncertain if it was a real word, because just because I never heard it doesn't mean it's not right.  Honestly, I only asked that because I thought it sounded funny, I truly didn't know if it was a real word or not.You just assume that everything I say is sarcasm or that I'm always attacking something...or whatever.  And just because I happen to be picky about grammar and spelling and all that doesn't mean that I'm an expert at it or that I always do everything right.

OK, my first entry's up.  Who wants to be on my fiends list? XD

The issue here is that everyone assumed I was being sarcastic and attacking Arkon's, or Crestoe's, choice of grammar when I really wasn't.  But, even tho I have more that I'd like to say, I won't.  Because that's not the topic here, and Shadow didn't post this so we could bicker about something stupid.So if anyone still has any issues with me, you can send me a private message.  Otherwise, we can just forget about this.

AND would anyone here condsider buying it if it was released?

YES!  It WORKS!   Now I can draw on the Oekaki board with my new tablet!   Thanks Shadow!  XP doesn't ship with JVM due to the court decision barring microsoft from redistributing Java.

And it didn't even hardly take a minute over broadband.

<div id='container'>
Ah, I figured it was something like that.  But I never had any reason to write in a journal.  Every day is exactly the same for me.  And when something different does happen it's too sporadic to bother dedicating a whole journal to it, and most of the time when something different happens it's not worth writing about anyway.

Brin wrote Startide Rising, which I believe was a great book. It may be possible to drop him an email to ask if he does plan to release a book. If Brin really is going to release DotF as a book, I have no doubt it would be just as good.

Um... that is what I said. Anyways, that is my guess as well. The ox is a powerful creature that must be defeated or destroyed to prove one's power.  Sorry Eoraptor! I did not realise that my e mail was not posted up. It should be fixed by now...

It doesn't run any games yet, but the emulator core is the farthest along of any PSX2 emulator that I know of. Most of the CPU is emulated now, along with the loader and memory routines. Already can run basic demos. I figure in 6-8 months there might be something interesting to see out of this devel group.

 Hee hee, thanks, Nori! &gt;^^&lt; I was sittin' there, bummed 'cause I hadn't drawn in a while. Then I just thought about my fanfic, and thought about some scenes. And there ya go. Actually, that scene takes place in the Second Coming, which is the revision created by people from the future of the original story. Confused yet? XD

Brin has a bad habit of assuming characters; In most of the uplift books Ive read there is a general lack of character development before the point-of-view skips off to wherever. Makes for incomplete characters that essentially live and die in the span of 3 paragraphs. There is much better ways to do multiple POV space opera; AFIS does it quite well.After a while it starts reading a little like a star trek synopsis, and those arent really that interesting. If I wanted B-rated sci-fi I'd stick with Eric Lustbader. At least he has gratuitous scenes of overly described violent sex.

<div id='container'>
Heh. I probably could Kit, however your idea sounds more like a novelty, like typing with my tongue. It wouldn't be the prefered position for maximin efficency.

Hey, Lizza, did you add me? Because the delphi you have isn't me. I didn't use the name Delphi because someone had taken it already. So I'm wicked_talynDamn that delphi person... I hate being unoriginal, though... let them have the damn name. ARGH!

It does it tiresome after awhile, but the books are well worth the read, especially when the movie did not include characters from the first book. Has abyone read up on biographys? I'm reading about Alexander the Great right now.....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What is the book about if I may ask? An Ecco novel? That would be interesting!
</div>

<div id='container'>
all I see are choped up dolphins and stuff

Ahhh,yes you can add me to your list Del!! I didn't think that Delphi girl sounded like you...I'll fix that.

Those are the tiles. They tend to be a bit hard to change, because they're placed oddly. The Tile Arranger in the top right is for putting them how they go, and when you edit them there, they get edited in the ROM, but placing one over another won't do the same.Screenshots will be later of how they go together.

sounds like a book where id skip the the dolphins nightmare chapter and read about the battle of the mutaclone. then neevr read again.  :P but it still sounds very interesting. i probably would buy it being an ecco collector.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Cant they email it to you again?

</div>

<div id='container'>
Yeah...I heard about those whales continually stranding themselves. Damn shame. I hope that one day, we can actually find out what really causes them to beach...and beach repeatedly. I feel sorry for that poor Baiji...it lived a long life,  to bad it was  spent in a concrete pool. What is also sad is that they think there's less that what...? 100 of 'em left? Makes me ill thinking about it....btw...ignore any crappy html u might see in my sig'....I'm just messin' with stuff right now. Pay it no mind.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmm....a DoF novel? That might be interesting....I'd read the Man's Nightmare stuff for sure, and yeah ok, Dolphin's Nightmare (even tho' I found it less interesting, but that's just me)...the whole Foe part at the end would be kinda boring tho'...cuz we all know how it ends.

5, actually. "World's most endagered cetacean" I think at 5, it's the worst most endagerred anything. But, that's only an estimate. And entire species have managed to remain hidden until the last hundred years or so. But then again, they have whole oceans to hide it while the Baiji only have that river in China.And the party dolphin in your sig looks fine. :)

*starts munching on cheese slices* Gotta eat sometime! Anyways... Gather around as I tell you the tale of what is possibly the greatest RPG in existance. It was released during the final days of the saturn system and 5,000 copies was released in the US alone. You play as a young boy who is guarding a remote excavation site when a turncoat general murders your captain and steals an artifact. A dragon saves his life and thus starts the journey to stop this general. The highlight of the game is the combat system, it works like the final fantasy ones but there are three gages. The more gages you fill, the powerful your attack will be or better access to your dragons abilities. However, enemies will attack you as you wait, but, these attacks can be avoided. The game has 3-d freedom, meaning that you can fly behind, in front or on the sides of your enemies. So there is also a bit of stragedy in this, since the enemies also have this ability. Anyways, the name Atolm comes from a powerful boss in the game, the dragon on my Avatar. You fight him many times and he grows stronger each battle. When i heard about this game, people said it was better than Final fantasy 7, and i had my doubts, since 7 is a good game... then i played the game. they were right. This game truly gives you 3-d freedom... besides, it is fun to fly and play in the skies. Just think of Ecco, but  with flight. So if you get the opportunity to play it, PLAY it! I'm also happy to learn that i bought it for 10.00 when on ebay, it goes as high as 200.00! haha! wow i wrote alot! questions?
</div>

Hey doomtrain im just now seeing your comic for the first time.I have to say at first i wasnt so sure but the comic is awesome!

I'll try to draw something on an oekaki board and it asks me to download something called "Java Virtual Machine".  It does that also with the PaintChat and whenever I try to view animations on the oekaki boards.  Also there was one other site with a page with four images and I could only see two, and it also asked me to downlaod the same thing.  Without it I can't view these things.It asks me to download the "Japanese Text Display Support"  O-o

Look! Look at this! Picture of the BETA...on a final release package of Ecco 2!!The pic comes from CoH. I only took out the small bit so you wouldn't have to wait. Look real close - this shot has an old Ecco 1 sprite, characteristic of the BETA...but the background is that of Ecco 2!!http://sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/Image1.png

Japanese sites can appear much better with that goodie installed. But I can't understand a word of it, so, there's no big wonder after all.

Never seen Gundum, sad to say. But Teknoman will live again! Okay, maybe not.http://icefall.org/Teknoman/images/tekicon.gif Teknoman Slade, because it was the only one I could find.Just hang in there, and the forums will seem a little less wierd everyday

Look around for Fargel EX, he does animated avatars. And a good job too. Problem is I don't think he's around at the moment...Until then, you can just crop an existing picture.

Yeah, you're going to fit in nicely. Just don't call me Mr. Artreus. I'll let Noriko keep calling me that just so we can be wierd. :?

Loking good, keep it up.Oh, yeah, I know what you're thinking, I've been keeping up with this too.

<div id='container'>
Actually...I was referring ignorant to the fact that I said the name before and people kept asking what the name was. I never heard of Panzer Dragoon either myself until I saw Atolm's avatar and wondering what it is.   YES!! NOTHING BEATS FINAL FANTASY!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hahahahaha! i do admit the final fantasy series is very good! I personally liked six, but panzer dragoon saga is my favorite.  I don't know, it is very addictive, the music is some of the best. I do agree that many people do not know about it and i remember reading somewhere that was the greatest injustice of it all. I also think that it changed the way RPGs looked to me. So limited... so i enjoy flying! anyways, i found a site that had some pictures of your dragon in his many forms (you dragon changes shape. Another cool thing, you can change your dragon to your own preferred combat form, I.E. defense, attack, magic or agility, or you can do a mixture.) check it out! http://www.draconic.com/gallery/dv300/panzersaga.html

Hi there! I'm new myself! The Gundam I like is 0083. Teknoman is one of my favories.... just wish it will be on the air soon.... maybe I'll check Ebay...

</div>

<div id='container'>
Oh, missed the mark, again. I play StarCraft, but someday maybe I'll get a hold of D2. There are, however, a few who do play somewhere around here... Talas, maybe?

I'm aware of PD and I knew that Atolm's image was of a PD. I just didn't say anything about it....and the fact that some ppl might not know PD doesn't mean that they're ignorant.   pThat series does look and sound pretty cool, At! o.o Now all I need is a copy of it and a Saturn. :P
</div>

<div id='container'>
Man, I am in college... Books are so expensive....  so much money..... Anyways, here is another set... Thurisaz, meaning Giant and a powerful force for fighting and defense. Gebo, to give and Elhaz, protection.OK..the Asterite is the "giant" who "gives" Ecco powers for "fighting, defense, and protection."Or it could mean something about the Big Blue (a "giant" of the sea) who tells Ecco about the Asterite.

<div id='container'>
I have PSO V1. Very fun game!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh heh. If you're gonna get one get a DJ - you don't have to pay for them. :pI didn't think I'd write in mine, either...but I update it everyday! o.o

Meh. I did another CG of a drawing I did early this morning (ie 1 AM @_@). I dunno. I really didn't like how the drawing came out ...it's OK, I guess. phttp://sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/Ulala.png
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Trellius, that is a nice picture of Vincent you got there! Know where I can find some pictures like that? Yes, a copy of PDS is very hard to find and very expensive! I go into ebay and watch people fight for the copies on for bid. It is very entertaining! I love the Grandia series, and I have the first Grandia for the Playstation and the second one for Dreamcast. I just recently passed the second one and that one was very fun!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It does! But also, it may tell us a bit more about Atlantis. The Runes used here were also used by the ancient peoples that lived in Norway and Denmark. Also, the Runes were associated with the Norse gods, Odin, Thor, etc. So it may also tell us about their gods and such.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, I loved Grandia II, too! I cried at so many parts, though!!! It was funny, too, because I would keep cursing at Zera or at Selene. XD And I would try and convince Ryudo not to fight Melfice, and Melfice not to be evil. It was quite humourous. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Too bad for Melfice, I really liked the guy too. Ever played the first Grandia? You can find it for the PS1.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i have Phantasy Star Online. and since i just barely got the net, i would like to play! I prefer the hunter class!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's one of the times I cried. &gt;.O No, I don't have a PS1, but can't you get it for Saturn?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm a hunter class, too! :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I felt such a sence of accomplishment when I figured out who Trellius' avatar was. Seeing as how I only have FF7 an Ecco was for my PS2, maybe I'll try some of these games.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XD!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wowies. Sounds like fun. Maybe I should start? o_o

Sega Saturnnnnn...I want one. ;.; I remember this one game I used to play...I wa slike...10 or 11. It was called "Knights" or something like that.

All right, fine. I'll look into it. I've had an interesting last few months anyway 
</div>

<div id='container'>
^___^ Yayee! That'd be spiffy! But if you did, you would  to let me and Delphi and Lizza and Kit know what your username was. So we could add you to our 'fiends' lists (XD). Yes. It is a must. NO BUTS ABOUT IT, MR. ARTREUS! (psh, as if you would've said no anyways)

I once had an Ecco dream. it was about two years ago and the dream started out. I was at a building and I walked in and there were these two girls sitting on the floor playing an Ecco game. I remember I got a very good look at the cover and it  was well detailed. The front of the sega game box almost looked like that of ToT except it was different. there was a sky tube in the middle and Ecco was in a different position. I also remember the name of the game. It was Ecco: The beginning of Time. all of a sudden my dream shifted and I was inside the game. It was in 3-d and there were sky tubes all around and the sky was a bright greenish color. The water was filled with creatures that looked like they were mutated versions of fish. I looked up and saw the outline of a dolphin (probably Ecco?) flying up one up the tubes. Then my skin started burning (Yes, burning. It felt like my skin was on fire.) and there was huge ball of light heading toward the ocean. It smashed into the tubes, but the dolphin escaped and flew back into the ocean and then everything turned a bright white.    Pretty weird, huh? My dream couldv'e been what the ecco 3 might have looked like if it ever came out.I did have another dream but it was too fast i couldene't make out what happened. I only remember seeing a dolphin with spikes all over it's body!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A dolphin with spikes? That's a clan dolphin from DotF.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow. o___o I wish my dreams were that exciting. Er. Ecco dreams, anyways....&gt;.&gt;;;;

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

Hey,I had an Ecco dream once.A few years ago.I dreamt that he had a huge crest on his back,kinda like the 1s you see on reconstructed dinosaurs.Also,he was a deep red colour and was in a cave-type level.Funky or what??I am the last of my people.I am alone.I wander with deep mourning for my people who have lost the memories of our past lifes.

Hiyas Duo! It's a pleasure to have you with us  :D  I played starcraft, warcraft 2 and 3, and Diablo 1 and 2.....awsome games!! Blizzard really makes cool stuff!!! Hmm....any of you guys played an online game called "Lineage"? If not you should try it...even though you have to pay $50 cents everyday to play it.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sega Saturn had some of the best games - or so I've heard. But I don't remember any games for it since my brother sold it a couple years ago. And you wouldn't guess that if he gets pissed at one game so bad like if he can't accomplish something in it, he would brake the game to pieces.and Atolm - get pictures at "httpwink:
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I can't remember any of the dreams that I had about Ecco, but I remembered something about BEING ecco.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I just recently received the starcraft battle chest as a gift not too long ago. It is pretty fun, but i prefer playing warcraft. Anyone else played the third one? Gott love those night elves!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hi! We haven't met yet but I would like to wish you a Happy Birthday as well! That would be the right thing to do anyway!  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thank you everyone for your comments! I have not drawn a dolphin for about two years! The reason being that some of my friends wanted me to take a shot at human drawings, so I dropped my dolphin studies. Anyways, I'm doing a creature that looks like a dragon but with a aquatic style into it. I'm calling her Karnaim (meaning two-horned) I hope to be done with her very soon!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Man, the only Ecco dream I had was when I was fighting the Asterite and all of these Puffer Fish came out of nowhere and would attack me nonestop. Damn, I hate those fish...

K, At. Which version ya got? Version one or version 2? I can't help if you have version2, though, 'cause I only have V1. Anyways, if you're version1, just load your game, and choose online mode. It'll ask you to type in some codes, which are found on the inside of the CD case, where you put the CD. Type 'em in and you're ready to go.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
No prob, DM.  I like helping people! No, I really do. o.o Ask Lizza! XDYus, Ninjai was awesome! Can't wait till Chapter 6!

Wow, it worked. o.o For me anyway.  If you can't see it this is the address//www.side7.com/art/cyntbeeh/self.jpgAnyway, I right-clicked on the pageand went to properties so it would show the address, in case the one I posted was wrong or something.  It gave me the address to the image by itself, so I musta right-clicked on the picture rather than the background.  I never even thought to try that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
How cute! ^_^ Great job, Teth! I love it! Specially your hair =]o.o Oh thanks! ^_^;(edit) I just noticed my glasses look kinda purplish. o.o; I dunno how that happened I sure didn't color them that way. They're actually supposed to be kind of a reddish-bronzeish color..But that is an actual shirt that I have, well sortof. The real thing is more detailed of course and has a tie-dye effect. But not like anyone cares I'm just rambling for no reason.

Tethies, they mentioned you on TV last nigt *laughs*they say it "teth-ease"like how I think the word is said.too bad your ocean is Africa nowWhat was this on? o.o;I do know that there used to be a Tethys Sea.Well anyway I think this is a neat idea.  I have a book on dinosaurs.  But it's more of a picture book, doesn't have a lot of info.  But it does have some.  It has some of the ancient sea reptiles in it.But Pangaea (or however the hell you spell that) is the name of the big land mass that later seperated into today's continents.  It means "all lands" or something.  The ocean that existed at that time was called Panthalassa ("all oceans").  This I know from Geoscience.I don't know much about ancient sea creatures.  But I know a little bit.  I only kinda scimmed thru a lot of the posts here so I'm not sure if crocodiles or sharks were mentioned.  I know that crocodiles existed since before dinosaurs, or at least as long.  And sharks have also been around at least as long as the dinosaurs.  The ancient sharks were huge.  There was one that was so big that one of its teeth was about the size of your palm (or bigger depending how big your palm is).The earliest crocodilians(relatives of the crocodiles) weren't very big, but there was one that looked exactly like a modern crocodile but was gigantic.  I can't remember what it's called, I'll have to look at that book of mine.And I know that three types of marine reptiles were the elasmosaurs, the ichthyosaurs (I musta spelled that wrong), and the mososaurs.  I think there was another kind too.  Again I have to look at my book.::
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
book:  And now a listing of all the marine reptiles, crocodylians, and other such things in this book.  I could scan pictures but I'd need a place to put them and I dunno where to put them.Triassic PeriodPistosaurus (Nothosaur)Placochelys (Placodont)Lariosaurus (Nothosaur)Askeptosaurus (Diapsid--"early reptile relative")Mixosaurus(Ichthyosaur)Cymbospondylus (Ichthyosaur)Henodus  (Placodont)Rutiodon (Phytosaur--"aquatic carnivore")Shonisaurus (Ichthyosaur)Early JurassicTeleosaurus (Crocodylian)Plesiosaurus (Plesiosaur)Temnodontosaurus (Ichthyosaur)Stenopterygius (Ichthyosaur)Late JurassicOphthalmosaurus (Ichthyosaur)Liopleurodon (Plesiosaur)Metriorrhynchus (Crocodylian)Early CretaceousBernissartia (Crocodylian)Pachyrhachis (Serpentes)Late CretaceousPlatecarpus (Mososaur)Elasmosaurus (Plesiosaur)Deinosuchus (Crocodylian)--This is the huge crocodile I was talking about, it looks just like a modern crocodile and for the size it says "possibly 49 ft long"Plotosaurus (Mososaur)Archelon (Chelonian--"turtle")*phew*There's also a whole page on ichthyosaurs.  I could copy what it says, but I'll do that later.
</div>

<div id='container'>
That is so totally cool. o.oI just kinda figured they probably didn't mean anything, that they just made it all up or maybe used authentic runes to make it look better but didn't bother to make them mean anything.  After all, you'd think they'd figure no one would care.After all, I'm sure lots of people never even noticed them (I didn't until I saw that screen shot) and if they did they'd just ignore them.  Why go thru all the trouble of finding out what they mean, especially if nobody cares? (I'm talking theoretically here)So why should they mean anything at all?  Did the people who did the graphics (or those in charge) actually think somebody might try to find out what those runes meant?  Why even have them there in the first place? Except to make it look cool or more authentic or something.  Now that we know (or at least have a theory) what it means, it IS cool.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a waste of time or anything.  It's interesting, really.  It's just that it seems odd that those who worked on the game would go thru all the trouble to look up what these runes mean and place an actual message in the game when nobody knows what they mean and chances are not many people actually care.  I mean, it's cool and everything, and interesting and all that, but the question is...why?Well...seeing as I am obviously rambling on here for no real reason....I guess I'll just shutup now.  You can just ignore everything I just said.

Arg! Those stupid puffer fish! &gt;&lt; I can't tell you how many times I got attacked by those god-forsaken little monsters. x_____________x Anyways, back to the point. I actually had an Ecco dream last night. It was very vague, though. I remember that it was Ecco swimming through a tube, like the ones in the vortex future levels. He reached the end, but there was nothing there. Like, literally nothing. Everything was just black...nothing...ness. and then I woke up.
</div>

<div id='container'>
-_-; alaster. shoot me.

<div id='container'>
*thouroughly confused*  Tha asterite had bland colors because he was an old mothafucka o_o  If he was suppsoed to eb a spirit or somethig hippie liek that, they would have told us.The asterite in the future looked golden to me, not bland.  But I never thought about it much. He was really old to begin with, he's been around at least since the meso.....uh, dinosaur period (*forgets what it was called exactly*).  As far as we know he coulda been around since the day the Earth was born.  Well...there was no life for a long time so maybe not.  But he does represent a giant DNA strand, and the very first life forms (bacteria) were nothing but a single strand of DNA surrounded by a cell wall with some of that...fluid stuff (I seem to have forgotten half of what I learned in Biology four years ago).Hm...so all the Asterite needs is a cell wall and he'd be a giant bacterium. (eewwww...)Don't mind me, I have caffiene and sugar in my system which seems to have warped my brain plus it doesn't help that all that talk about time travel jumbled my brain even more.::Is the Asterite even a "he"?  Does it even have a gender? o.o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well on the time thing...You can't change the past cuz....It's like, well, if you go into the past well your future self has already done it and it's like a cycle that never ends.  Like the idea that the reason why dolphins evolved into aquatic mammals is because Ecco went into the past and they heard his songs and were inspired to live in the water.  And so they evolved into today's dolphins and then Ecco was able to exist as he was and then he went into the past and they heard his song....etc, etc, etc.  And also the idea that the Asterite was missing a globe because Ecco went into the past and stole a globe from the Asterite in the past so that he could give it back to the Asterite in the present.Also, in the same sort of way you can't change the future by traveling to the future.  You can, however, steer it in a certain direction by your actions in the present.  Because the future is not predetermined (at least don't believe it is, except maybe to a small extent).  But if you travel to the future, well first of all there'd be countless different versions of what could possibly happen.  And then...well maybe you could change it but you couldn't change the things that happened to lead up to that future and it would be like....whatever you did in the future would be as if it never happened because you'd still have the option of acting in the present towards steering the future in a certain direction and it could be different. Boy, I'm confusing myself here.  Actually I think that you probably couldn't actually go into the future because it doesn't exist yet. It's more plausible to travel to the past because it's already happened and everything's all set.  But the future has not happened yet and what does happen in the future completely depends on what is happening now.  So, in reality, you couldn't really travel to the future because it's not set.  But I suppose it may be possible to go and see what could possibly happen based on what's already happened in the past.Okay I wrote a lot more than I intended and now I've confused myself.

Ninjai would make a good anime, but NOT an American cartoon.  Because they'd take out all the blood and all the body-parts-severing and they'd try to make it all nice and stuff.  So it would only work as an uncut anime.

I know I'm a bit late but I haven't been around in a while.  Just don't hang around as much as I used to.But anyone who's a fan of Duo Maxwell is welcome in my book! I think the Epyon is the coolest-looking of the Gundams but Duo is still my fave chara in that series.But I've never played any of those games that have been mentioned, never had any interest in them.

I'll just let you know it wasn't forgotten, and Cally wasn't let down. Shadow caught her birthday and started a topic for it. I guess it wasn't so eye catching though. But Sten, I'm sure creating your own will mean something special to her, for how many people get two birthday topics.

I was wondering about that as well. The thought of translating the runes never came to me until i came to this site. What is the point of putting in the runes? Who knows, maybe someone on the team knew the language and since it is ancient, thought it would be a nice twist. Also, the use of the runes would make the city look more ancient, and since there are still people that can read the runes, accuracy may have been important to them. My thoughts anyways.

That would make sense.You know I think I said the essentially same thing somewhere around three or five times in that last post...I think I was trying not to sound like a moron and just ended up with the opposite effect instead..x.xAhem...Yeah, that makes sense.  I already said that.  But that's kinda what I was thinking--after I made that post--that maybe it was something like what you said, or maybe they just wanted to make it as authentic as possible.But we'll never know and it doesn't even really matter that much.  And I dunno why I even bothered thinking about it or especially saying anything on the matter.

I'm still working on the picture of all four Ocean Gaurdians, after having to put it on hold twice in order to work on requests and getting off to a rather slow start in the first place.  I hadn't been working on it much until now.Well, anyway, the four of them are all supposed to be shiny.  Like the kind of shinyness you get with a tumbled gemstone (not like one that's been cut and polished like in jewelry, but tumbled like you might find in a craft store or some gift shops).  Anyway, I was wondering if anybody had any tips on how to make something look shiny like that in Photoshop 5.5 (or 6 assuming it's very similar).  I've never been very good with higlights and shading, especially when it comes to making something look shiny.So it would be great if someone could give me some tips or something.Thanks in advance.

Well,keep in mind,it IS a rumor,after all.So I can't really take credit for finding anything.Even though I would love too...   I got reply back from him... Here's my original letter.&gt;Hi there.&gt;&gt;Well,I just wanted to tell and ask you something.I'm a fan of the Eccogames,and I know you did the plot for the third,DOTF.&gt;&gt;I loved the intricate job you did on it,and it's my favorite game in theseries,by the way.&gt;&gt;I heard you where planning on releasing a Novel adaptation of it.If youare,PLEASE go thru with it,because I think it's a great idea.As does amajority of the Ecco community.&gt;&gt;I only have one request from it,that it follow the continuity,and have thisbe Ecco's third venture,and not his first.Or at least that's how I willalways see it...&gt;&gt;Thank you for your timeNow,this is his reply...Hi!Thanks for your kind words and insights. I find it genuinely moving whenpeople write to me in the way you did.Yeah ECCO is fun.  Too bad about Dreamcast.I had to work with the designers and write the story around the game theyalready were developing so I had little choice to expand beyond... but theresults were immensely satisfying, yes?  Perhaps I will write a story setthere, someday!Meanwhile, do look up my award-winning novel about dolphins in spaceSTARTIDE RISING.  You may like it too.With best wishes for a happy, successful 21st Century!David Brinwww.davidbrin.comHuh.Well,didn't tell me much.Oh,and he also plugged a book.Thanks a pantload,Brin...

Here I go again with my game opinions but im really dissapionted with warcraft 3, the graphics arent what were promised, the gameplay is pretty good but its a pretty biased game. Even though personally I am a HUGE fan of any elves, I HATE the night elves. The humans have god dammed steam tanks ans flying gyrocopters with riftles on them. This might be just me but Warcraft 3 is a good game...Not great but good.

I thought i'd let everyone know i got a new blundercaves up. Of course its not flash since those are a bitch to do. But i hope with this said well continue the bludnercaves series and hopefully start adding new characters in.

Guys, if ever I needed your halp, it was now. Copied and pasted from my DeadJOurnal, because I'm too emotionally and physically worn out right now to retype.You know something...You never think it can happen to you. You never, ever think.But it can.And it happened to me.My dad, the one person in my family I'm closest to...had a stroke.The worst you can have.He's bleeding in his brain. The doctors can't operate on him...or he will die.He will anyway. I know he will. I can tell. I can always tell these things.I prayed. But it won't do anything. I know it won't. Because bad things always happen to me. I'm a bad person. I've sinned too much. It's revenge on me. It's all my fault. It's my curse.We're going to the hospital. He's not dead, but he's in a coma of sorts. I'm going to try and believe that he'll be OK, but I'm having a hard time doing it.We're going soon, so...I'll update this somtime. I don't know.

My Ecco dreams are always strange ! Is it normal ?! lolI think all dreams are strange.  Or at least most.Hmm...if dreams are supposed to have meanings, than what does it mean when you dream about a video game? Lol. I think it'd be okay if you told us. Heck, I brought up my FFVIII dreams with Ir-uh. Yea, I think it'd be alright. =]Okay, fine.  Just as long as we can get right back on topic.Actually I had another dream related to Golden Sun last night.  It must be because just less than a week ago I finished playing thru it for the second time, I had decided to pick it up again because I was bored.The first one seemed like it was suppose to be part of the sequel (btw, does anyone have any idea when GS2 is supposed to come out?).  It felt like I was almost a part of the game, except that I wasn't any of the characters (like in so many dreams I've had where I dreamt I was a character from something).  I think I was really just playing it, but I didn't see myself playing it...Uh....anyway, the four characters were in a forest that kinda reminded me of Kolima Forest but it was different.  They came to a sort of a tree house and knocked on the door (this whole thing seemed to be an animation sequence, even tho there were no tru animations in the game).  And it was after this point that the only connection to the game was the just characters, because it doesn't seem like anything that would be in either the original game or even the sequal.  Anyway, they told the guy that lived there that they sought food and shelter for the night.  In fact, they actually spoke, and even Isaac said a few things (I can't remember what) even tho in the game he never says a single word.  Anyway they go in and this guy's got other people with him in the treehouse, and they're certainly not the kind of people I'd want to spend a night with.  They're rude and just plain nasty, and one of them keeps making advances towards Mia.  Like I said, it didn't seem like anything that would actually be in the game.  It was pretty weird actually.  And that's about all I can remember.Then the dream I had last night was shorter, I believe.  This one was also weird.  It was a battle scene with the four against some blueish-greenish dragon-like creature and no matter what they did it just wouldn't die.  That wasn't the weird part.  The weird part is that I remember seeing them chasing the thing around in circles throwing fireballs and other magic thingies at it.  While they were getting worn out, this creature just simply wouldn't die no matter how many hits it took.  Finally they managed to take it out--or maybe it ran away or something, I can't really remember.  And that was the end of the dream.Actually, now that I think about it more, I remember a bit more clearly what was going on....Mia was chasing this creature around in circles throwing blue fireball-type-things at it (probably more like water balls in her case), Isaac was standing there throwing various magic attacks at it, I can't remember what Ivan was doing but I think he was also standing there and throwing various magic attacks at it, and Garet in the meantime is standing there fending off a swarm of bee-like things that were surrounding him (and apparantly ignoring everyone else) which I had a feeling they were supposed to be poisouness or something. I think Isaac finally defeated the creature using one of his big earth-type magic attacks, and I dunno what happened to the bees because I woke up too soon.x.o yeah...I'd say that was pretty weird.

Ok little tip from the materials department of any 3D prog: high speculars make a material look like plastic. If you wanna make a white surface shine, make it reflective and slightly metalic.

...Oh, Kitnee. I'm so sorry. *huggles you* ;.; But don't say that! It was not your fault! Not your fault at ALL! these things happen to people, it's not punishment for anything. If there was ever a time where I really wished I could do something and it would help...it's now. I can't even tell you how sorry I am. ._. I wish I could make it better...it breaks my heart to see people suffer. *hugs you again* just remember that you can talk to me about anything, whenever, okay? I'm always willing to listen.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh interesting. but where did you hear the rumor of him writing a boo based on ecco DOTF?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
you shouldnt think its a sin on you kitnee. blaming yourself is not the correct solution.Im sorry this has happened to your father but you need not to give up faith. If theres one thing i learned its to never give up even if the odds are stacked against you.I had a grandmother who had a pretty hard stroke. it made it so she couldnt walk and made her have other problems. she ended up living for another 8 years the sad thing was she couldnt do the things she wanted to and had to live in an old folks home.The positibe thing was for the last few years she was happy to be with her family but eventualy she choose her time to die and i wasn't sad about it cause i understood that she knew she lived up to her purpose. i feel bad about not getting able to visit her during her last moments but i dont dwell on it. shes not gone afterall. anyone who passes away and is family is apart of you. even if its a friend somethnig about them becomes something apart of you overtime. I have seen people come and go through out mylife its hard to let them go but sometimes its the best thing you can do. BUT...your father is still alive even though im not the religious type if i could recommend something for you it would be to prey. if your not religious trie to have faith and dont blame yourself so much. im sure your father would feel much better if you didn't.am i right?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
what are all you people "o_o" at me for?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i had a feeling the ruines ment something. problem was i had no way to translate them. callyfin told me they were originally ruines from vikings and that there was no translation of there language.before you came i was already corrected that tolkins ruines were related to viking ruines.But finally we got a translation and im glad we do.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah but i dont see that happing soon.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow. o_o Very nice, Arkon. Let me just take this time to also saaaay that my great grandma and great aunt both died of strokes too, but...keep in mind that they were both around...oh...96? x_x Anyways, I just want to tell you, Kit, that I can't even count how many stories I've heard from people who said that times like the one you're going through brought them even closer to God than they thought possible. So yea, like Arkon said, don't give up faith. *sheepish smile*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
cuz it was funny. *snicker* o_o what? Can't we 'o_o' without a reason? (No? ...okay then. *shuffles away*...)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XD! Hilarity.  Where DO you come up with these things? *chuckle*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Um....okay....1. I don't know what you mean by "high speculars"2. I don't know how to make something look reflective or metallicThat's the problem, I haven't a clue.  Well, actually I do have a clue, I figure at least part of it is a matter of putting highlights and shadows in the right places.  Problem is, I'm not exactly sure where the right places are, except that I know I have to keep constant with the direction of the light source.I think that what I've done so far looks fine.  But it doesn't look quite as good as I'd like.  I don't exactly have any actual sources to look at right now (the best thing I think would be my collection of tumbled semi-precious stones, but that's at the cottage).  Of course even if I did that doesn't mean I would be able to do it seeing as I'm not sure what sorts of tools and special effects I should use.

hey doomtrain im gonna make sure to put a link in my links section to your site. your comics rock. they actualy kinda inspired me to do the blundercaves again.heh speaking of which im gonna have to add you in the next one i do. this should be fun.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
specular is the point of brightness on a curved section of material. Use for surfaces that have plastic-like quality; shine without reflectivness. Theres a serious bit of math that defines the calculation of specular lighting, but for simplicity's sake, any curved surface that faces a light source should recive a highlight.Reflectivity is easy. Just redraw the foreground inverted and slightly distorted, just the hint thereof can make it work.

I was thinking the same thing Arkon. 100 reply's and we're still on topic... and not even locked! Now let's just keep it that way. Come on Arkon... you know you wanna draw yourself. I see you have a beautiful face pic right now in fact. Heh heh.

Ha ha! I'm really, REALLY flatered! Like... really! Thank you so much! The reactions I've been getting are much better then I thought they would be from everyone. But Arkon, you really did just make my day! I'm also very glad I somehow inspired you to do a new Blundercaves (which I loved btw... very funny indeed!), it's always good to know that my comics are good for a little something extra. ^_^I'd be honored to be in your links too! I'll get yours up right away myself. Thanks for all the support Ark, it means a lot.Oh! And I can't wait for the next blundercaves too! &gt;D Power to the Dumbtrain, biatch!!!

Heh. Yup, thanks to Mr. Artreus! ^_^ I had totally lost it, it was like...completely erased and had no hope of ever returning. o___o And I was too lazy to make it again. But luckily, he had it saved on his computer. ^___^ So he sent it to me and now I have it back! Yayness! Well. Until Crestoe gets done with the one he's sposedta be making me.Anyways, I know what you mean. =] Teth is cool, but sometimes...I don't know. I really know her well enough to judge her or anything, but just from what I do know. Hehe. Can't wait to see the next one. XD

<div id='container'>
I'm very sorry to hear about your father Kitnee, i can relate to it since my grandmother also had a stroke. However, you should not despair, for my grandmother survived but had to leave the job that she loved. A few months later, her husband died to cancer, and since i live with them, the loss ached me a whole lot. DO NOT think that this is your fault! it never is nor will be. I am sorry, i do not know what else to say. I'm never good at this sort of thing... i hope things will turn out for the best for you.

Thank you all so much, you guys.Arky, you're absolutely right. I know that now, but when I wrote that I was at my ultimate low point. But after I came back from the hospital, and after I heard the updates today, I've gotten more hope. *hugs everyone*I'm going to go back and visit him today, and pester him about opening his eyes. :p 'Cause once he does that, I'm pretty sure everything will be a lot better.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wooooooorrd!Ha ha! Nice shit Arkon! New characters are always fun to see in it. I loved Shado... heh heh. And two in a short time! Good job. Can't wait for the next one!

Hi every1 i guess since it seems every1 may browse only 1 forum i will just say "hi" here also :P.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Took me a while to udnerstnad why we had to put rules here so i'll explain.First off if everyone posts in the secreat forum noone else out there will see it. plus it could cause the rest of the forum to become dead.That wouldnt be too welcoming to newbies.Second it be alot cooler if you shared things here that make this place a better forum to be apart and make non members jelous and want to join.I know i should contribute some things i probably will pretty soon. i had a blundercaves flash movie i never showed to the world. personally i thought it sucked but it was a big episode i might share that withen the next few days.Anyways thought id inform you people about "why the deadness?"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
haha, serious! One day my friend wanted to pick on me and asked me if i was hungry. He pulled out a can and it was labled canned dolphin. It had a picture of a dolphin with x's for eyes and along the side it said it was tuna safe. It was pretty funny but i still did beat the crap out of him.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
haha! Not at all! Im having fun!  :D  It has been a long time since my artwork has been online, i have more but they do not go with the sea theme. but it has been a long time since i drew marine life, so it is a good opportunity for me to brush up on my skills!

My character doesn't have much of a story. But this how it goes.Leviathansharks live in the deepest parts of the oceans. Their ancestors, who were lords of the oceans back in prehistoric times, were gigantic great white sharks called Megalodons. They were over sixty feet long and could easily tear apart a T-Rex in seconds. Having just eaten an Itchyosaurus, one particular Megalodon watched as a ball of fire streaked aross the sky and crashed onto a small island next to it. The radiational energy killed all life in and around that area. However it seemed to have a opposite effect on the shark. Instead of destroying it, the radiation passed through the water and cross-mutated it with the DNA from the Itchyosaurus, thus creating the dawn of a unique species. The jaws of a shark, the speed and agility of a dolphin, and larger than a Blue Whale, they live shrouded in darkness in the depths of the ocean, waiting for the world to be one great ocean again so they can flourish as they did once long ago.This species has glowing blue lines across its sides and has reptillian eyes that glow green and purple when threatened or disturbed.These creatures also have magical powers but rarely use them. Its mostly used to kill giant squids and other prey. Their dorsal fins are sometimes seen gliding through the water and are as tall as an oceanliner.

Scientists are studying the case of the Cuvier's beaked whales, who strand by entire families.They think it's the US NAVY 's sonars who damage some cerebral tissues of these cetaceans. So, they lose their sense of orientation. Or the tissues can get infected. We don't know.

Man that sucks. I love the resident evil series, and hearing that the remake went to gamecube, that pissed me off. I hate having to buy new systems just for one game. By the way, i heard that Squaresoft went back to nintendo, does it that mean that the Final Fantasy series will be continued on gamecube?I know that 11 will be online, but it is something that i am thinking about. Wouldn't that be something, yeesh.

Well, I've come up with something new for her...I decided that she has 3 forms. o_o She has her normal form, as a sea-person with fins and stuff, then she has her 'phin form and then she has her human form. So far I have her human and sea-person forms drawn out. I just need to make up a dolphin form for her.  It shouldn't be too hard, right?

http://arkonviox.com/blundercaves/avatars/avatar_pesty_1.gifI'm a tadpole. o.o;Hm...there's only one problem with my character.  I would never be caught starting a sentance without capitalization.  Nor would I spell "beautiful" wrong.(Sorry, couldn't resist)And I don't like frogs.  Okay, that's a lie.  I'm just not a big fan of them.  Not that it matters.  (See, an example of another part of my personality that ought to be incorperated at some point--babbling). Well I guess I should make some sort of comment about those episodes.  As usual they're very funny.  I even laughed at my own persona.  Actually, I didn't laugh out loud.  It takes a great deal to get me to actually laugh out loud.  But I was laughing inwardly.  Babbling again...better shut myself up.

I already mentioned that book has two pages about the Ichthyosaurus.  And I said I could copy what it says here.  But I won't if nobody wants me to, or if nobody cares.  Because, even tho it's not a full two pages, it will still probably make for quite a long post.

I won't see her at school again, so we decided to spend time together before she leaves.

On that subject matter, I wonder what Japanese keyboards look like anyway?I mean they have two writing systems, Hirigana and Katakana (or howver those are spelled), one which is used for smaller words and one for bigger words.  And then there's Kanji, but they probably don't use that much, it's an older system based off Chinese symbols and each symbol has several different meanings.  But I've also seen stuff on Japanese sites written with Roman capital letters.  BTW you can use AltaVista to translate websites in different languages.  But it doesn't always work so well, it seems to work better on some sites than others.  But I've only used it to translate Japanese sites, it might work better for other languages.  Maybe it's just that it can only translate one of the two major writing systems.address//world.altavista.com/

Actually WACOM is the brand.  The product itself is a tablet.I myself recently got a tablet.  It's not a WACOM but it works just fine.  I got it at Meijer.  The least expensive WACOMs are almost 100 bucks.  And those ones are only about 4"x5".  I only paid about 50 bucks for mine and it's about 5"x6.5".  That's the active area anyway.  I don't see the point to spending a bunch of extra money for something that's probably about the same. Can't imagine what could be different about it.

My dad had a panic attack once, and I was really worried.  I wanted so badly to do something to help him but I didn't know what to do.  I don't know if a panic attack can kill someone, but my dad got thru it fine. When my grandpa died a few years ago, I was with my family at the cottage for the weekend, like we've gone there every weekend during the summer ever since we bought it, and I had my best friend over.  My grandpa had been in the hospital, and this was just after my grandma had gotten out.  While we were at the cottage it was either my aunt or uncle who called and told us my grandpa had passed away.  We went home right away and took my best friend home.  I have no idea how she felt at the time.  It was especially hard on my grandma, of course, but all the more so because she had recently begun to develop Alzheimer's and that made it worse.  My grandma on my mom's side was even closer to me, she was only 72 when she died of cancer more than 10 years ago.So I know how it feels at least to a degree.  I always hate it when other people are depressed because it makes me feel depressed.  But I'm glad you're okay now, Kitnee.

clymene dolphins, if i remember right, are closely related to spinner dolphins, but they are not as acrobatic. They can be found in the Atlantic. My favorite Cetecean species include the Hourglass, Common, and the Pacific White Sided. Has anyone heard of a strap-toothed whale, man they have strange teeth!

Sorry to hear that Tethys. Like I said earlier, I'm never good at these things, so I don't know what to say.

<div id='container'>
unfortunately, tethys, i fear that only certain users have a status in this forum that allows them to delete their posts or even other posts... i have noticed as well that even though it says "edit/delete," there appears to be no specific "delete" button. but, of course, i could be wrong and it is in the most obvious of places ^_^;;i personally kind of found the two new characters rather amusing... though i'm not quite sure if tethys' character is supposed to be named "Pest" or "Pesty," since both seem to be mentioned in there... oh well, at least arkon shortened my character's nick from neogeeko to just plain neo. i also really liked these new blundercaves episode, certainly held my interests until the very end... quite odd that i gave birth, though O_x... there's a lesson in here, kids; never, ever come into contact with a giant dil-"Watch your language!"... at least my baby was able to kick some major nuudell ass in that episode  :D  excellent job, arkon! keep up the good work!

Blaming yourself for that reaches a high level of total nonsense. Death walks with us, we can die in every second of the life. Sometimes it's just a question of possibilities, or call it the balance betwen good and bad luck.Even if I don't know you or your father, I feel sorry of hearing that, and I hope to hear good news.In this topic, I totally share arkon's point of view. My grandmother died near a month and a half ago, and, you know? almost 90 years it's a good year ammount for a human. And she was able to walk and do normal life until the end. No, I was not sad.  I know that your case it's totally different and this last comment comes offtopic, but hey, there's a sure thing, blaming yourself can't fix nothing, and can't make feel better to you or your father.And now, my apologies if I was rude. This is a delicate topic.

Okay...Mmh...dasfoirbes (3 words)

<div id='container'>
Pretty! ^_^Altho I still don't understand how you can tell orcas apart... o.oLet me explain it to you. Orcas seem to be all the same physically, but if you study pictures of them, you'll note differences. For example, some orcas (like Winnie) have got little black or white spots on the body. Some colored zones of the body are always different between each individuals: the eyepatches (white spots behind the eyes), the saddle (or saddlepatch, behind the dorsal fin),  and the white motives at the "corner" of the mouth.Well, for one, each orca has its own individual saddle patch. And there are other markings like eyespots and whatnot to tell them apart, too.Yeah, the saddle is one of the best way to ID a killer whale; with the shape and scars of the dorsal fin.But in captivity, the orcas are often outside of the water, so we can also use the eyepatches.

^_@ They didn't really tell me much else about it, though. Just one of those weird things. Like. My dad went to high school with Dave Navarro(sp?). Yeh. They were in a garage band together. XD It's funny 'cuz sometimes he tells me stories of stuff they used to do. o_C;

<br />

<div id='container'>
Right...That's fine if you have a chance to study them closely.Well I guess it's kinda like how tigers all have different stripe patterns.  But they still all look the same to me.Oh well, whatever.

. Has anyone heard of a strap-toothed whale, man they have strange teeth!nopeI dunno why some people consider me an animal expert.  I obviously don't know much about any of them.

Yeah, I've used ol' Babelfish before. But the translations they give you are funny as shit. o.o Like this one, from the official Power Stone 2 website:"As for the gourmand cock length of the luxurious airship royal heaven number which turns the world."Yeah, when it is able to translate something, it does it literally.  Very literally.  So if something is slang or has a different meaning than it comes out sounding funny.  And in any language there are words that have more than one meaning, altho I get the feeling it's even more so with Japanese, and the babel fish obviously doesn't look at context.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*shrugs* I really don't know. I haven't seen faces like those in a long time, so I have forgotten what most mean.All you have to do is look at them, and have enough imagination to be able to see them as a face.And it helps to think of anime expressions.I think that ^_^ and n_n are also the same.  as well as ^.^ and n.nOn a side note, WHY are we talking about ASCII faces?And on a completely different subject, what was the original purpose of this topic again?(edit) Oh yeah.

Ofcourse the text didnt have proper capitolization you idiot. He was making the character speak, not writting a fucking book Tethy's.Just cuz his grammar, punctuation and what not is bad makes you feel that hes stupid doesnt mean the person behind the keyboard is you fucking nit-pick. You get what hes saying, why the fuck you do you always gotta bitch about it like a fuckin' english teacher. I wish you'd just shut yer god damn mouth about that for once instead of finding something not to your liking. Not everyone's you, Miss So-Fucking-Perfect.

Smells like it will be Ecco1 again. One more time.It can't be that expensive to do a new 2d game like that. And GBA sells a lot, it can be really rentable for appaloosa/sega.The voice of the truth: It can be more rentable if they don't do all that extra work and they use the old game again, ignoring the preys of old school ecco players and selling it to the new players, little grasshopper.Damnit.

Hm. Wow. I don't know. For me, if I wrote a story there would HAVE to be violence, though. e.e That's like, a must. That way it's exciting. =D That is, if I make a story for poor Noriko. I know I will eventually, but I just need to think of something. x_x Anyways, you should ask Arkon.

Okie dokie! Combining a couple things into one! Alright, I have finished it! The picture of Noriko's dolphin form, that is. I have a black and white one and a coloured one (which I hate, but hey...) I haven't gotten the chance to put it up in my fanart gallery yet, so you can see it at my gallery at DolphinParadise. ^_^ Okay, second item here, I made two little sprites of meh. You know, like, for the comix and shiz? Yuh. ^__^ I just thought I would show you. They're me in my dolphin form though, because that was a whole lot easier to do than the 'normal' Noriko. *nod nod* Anyways, here you go//www.dolphinparadise.net/albums/album06/abd.pnghttp://www.dolphinparadise.net/albums/album06/abe.png

Yeah..I DLed a small client as to update with, but I dunno if it'll work. Probably not, if it's the whole server. XP

I should download a client to update with. x_x I always told myself I would, but then I never did. *smackies herself*

Very nice Noriko. I actually don't think the colored version came out that bad, considering its a very simple, subdued technique. Perhaps that wasn't what you were going for.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks, Shadow. ^^ Yes, I think that's why I don't like it very much. The colouring job wasn't really what I had in mind. I had, like, this visualisation of what I wanted it to look like and it didn't turn out anything like it. x_x I hate it when that happens.

Well, i have the movie. Kinda .... dull with the characters. It is all about the realistic graphics, which is pretty damn good. But that is all that it had to offer, just a show of graphics.

Hmmm , being a dildo is not as bad.At least , there is a human being who likes you for what you are.Hahah, you have a point.

The movie was a wonderful 3d work, and at first seems like a good movie.But in the end, it gets really bored. That's my point of view. A pity, cause the 3d work was awesome.

<div id='container'>
That's curious, some type of blonde/goth/undead hybrid.Yeah, paint the hair of white too, that usually rocks. And over a tit you can add a tatoo of "www.arkonviox.com" with a gothic ttf font. Ya know, some advertise always come handy.Nah, just kidding, it seems great in that way.

 You used Photoshop, right? Any special trick you'd like to share? ^_- Heh heh.Um.....practice?Well I kept looking at it thinking what more can I do to make it look shiny?  So I did more shading and highlighting than usual.  As you know I used that water tutorial for the water.  For the shading and highlights on the characters I used a variety of tools.First I just used the eyedropper to get the orignal colors than made them a little darker for the shadows and a little lighter for the highlights.  Than, after blending, I used the airbrush tool (with white) in a few select places, and blended again.  Than I used the dodge tool and the burn tool.  And I used the sponge tool set on desaturate for some of the darker areas and set on saturate for some of the lighter areas, which ends up giving kind of a plasticy effect.  Then I added more highlites with the airbrush, since I wasn't quite satisfied with what I had already done with it.  I did my best to make the areas away from the light source darker and the areas closer to the light source lighter.After I was satisfied that it looked as good as I could get it with those tools, I used a couple filters.  I used the magic wand to select each character and used the plastic wrap on each one individually, keeping the highlight strength low and the other two values high.  Then I went to the eyes, and for each eye I used first plastic wrap, than diffuse glow, and then spherize.Than, the last thing I did was use the lighting effect.  First I set it on directional then move it until it looks about the same as without the lighting.  I do this because it's not the light that I want, but the texture channel.  I always set the material on "metallic" at the highest value.  Than I go down to texture channel, set it on blue, select "white is high" , and set the height to about 5.  That way it's enough to make a noticeable difference, and to give a good effect, but it also doesn't make it look all bumpy.*phew* Okay I think I'm going to give my hands a rest before I type everything else that I wanted to say.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
WOW ! It's awesome Tehtys !   I like the water effect ! I saw the tutorial about it Doomy gave to you, and I immediately tried !   
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay, so, anyway...The JPEG compression really killed it, usually I don't have this much of a problem with it.  It doesn't look too bad, but believe me it looked a lot better before I uploaded it. Which makes me think.  Arkon, do you know if it would work if I tried to upload a PNG file onto the art gallery?or you coulda scanned blue paper/fabricfor water...taken a pic of a pool.it's largenss scared meAw but that woulda been no fun.   Actually I didn't think of that.  But the pool idea....first of all we don't have one that you don't have to pay to get in (not to mention I have no idea how late in the summer they're open) but we do have a lake.  Either way it's an underwater effect I wanted, and I don't think we have any cameras that would go underwater.And, comon, it's not THAT big.  I didn't want it to be too small because it would kinda downplay the smaller characters.your character tethys kinda reminds me of Arknovious. Not Arkonviox. Arknovious another one of my characters.Yeah I've seen that guy.  Well of course seeing as Tethys is based of an elasmosaur...or is it a plesiosaur?  One is a variety of the other and I can never seem to get it straight since I had the names mixed up when I was little...Well, anyway, I'm sure you know what I mean.  Tethys is based off the kind with the shorter neck.  And Arknovious definately seems to be based off the same thing, except it's the long-neck variety.  So...yeah.  Sometimes I just don't seem to know what I'm talking about.All of them are based off something real, actually.  Except for Salacia, she's what is called a campchurch (a hippocamp is half horse, half fish. a campchurch is similar except that it's a unicorn instead of a horse).  Well, horses and fish are real, so you could say she's kinda based off real animals.And speaking of Salacia, if you compared this picture to the original one I drew of her you'd see that I made a few minor changes.  I was trying to make her look slightly more original.  I may even end up changing her even more in the future if I ever decide how to do it.  Oh, and her eyes look kinda whiteish but they're actually purple.  It seems the gleam managed to somehow take over when I resized it. Once again I wrote more than I originally intended...

Although i dont have much as of yet, Arkonviox and Yogoat have seen my small progress that will surely keep a good pace all this week till its ready and i hope to have it here so i can bring back good ole All in the family fandom! =)But again, i still need to do face pics and theres still quite a few ppl i owe. I ask that Artreus, Noriko, and Kitnee to resubmit their face pic requests immedietly so i can get those out of the way. Oh, and im still workin on Silverfins although it needs work or a reworked on. Although ill give them out gradually becuz of the work im going to try to put in on the flash movie, ill be sure to have you guys in new threads in no time!Sorry for the delays folks. i feel ive been lettin ya down on what've ive prmissed and ill try really hard to make those promisses.

I get the idea you've all forgotten everything I said about these guys when I posted the original pictures of each of them.  It doesn't really matter, of course, especially since this is supposed to be about artwork.  But I thought I'd just refresh your memories on a few things.The blue one at the top is Tangaroa, the Pacific Ocean Guardian.  Tethys, one of the two females of the group, is the Atlantic Ocean Gaurdian.  You should know by now which one she is, and if not my avatar is a good clue.Salacia, the other female of the group, is the Indian Ocean Guardian.  She's the red one.The white one at the bottom is Alignak, the Arctic Ocean Guardian....why is it that I keep wanting to switch the "a" and "u" in "guardian"?

<div id='container'>
Bye Sten! Have fun on your vacation. ^___^ I'll miss you! (Will you bring pictures? =D)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
w00000! Trees, because they have sap in 'em! ^.^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^.^ You know what some other good book are? The Space Trilogy by C.S. Lewis. They consist of 'Out of the Silent Planet', 'Perelandra' and 'That Hideous Strength'. I liked the first two a little better than the last one (it was a bit slow) but they're spiffy. And, as Atolm said about the Left Behind books, you don't have to be religious to enjoy them. =]
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Good work Nori ! I love it !
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

It most likly had nothing to do with the game, but for paranoia reasons back up your computer's beloved files just in case you get Cubs.mabye we can both make a walk through for the senerios.

<br />

<div id='container'>
some scanners are 70 bucks....or 60
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hehe. Atolm, he looked really funny. You know how sometimes people get slightly dorky expressions on their faces? Yea, like that. I'd scan it, but her dad is really bad with losing things. x_x It's probably in their garage somewhere. (Their garage is like the bermuda triangle, I swear)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Resubmit? Okie, you got it! *scampers over to her email* Wait...where's the original face pic topic? I forgot the questions. ._.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Alright you too. There's enough Jimmy for all of ya's! ^_- Anyone could use double the love'n!Anyways though.... I need to know honestly what you people think of Dawn. I have this feeling that no one really likes her because she's coming off as a huge bitch. I'm almost done episode 4, and I'd like episode 5 to do a little someing in Dawn's favor. Cause... she's really a nice a person!  Honest! But... what do you guys think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Have lot's of fun Sten! I wish a safe trip and happy journey to you, there and back!!!! May I ask where you're off too?

<div id='container'>
crestoe don't screw with her head :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The thought of getting a scanner has came to my head, but it seems that one of my friends is getting it for my birthday. Still, I'm a bit impatient.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ohhh purdy!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey orcacaller! welcome! It's pretty cool to have you here i been kinda hoping youd join. the problem your having with the avatar is probably because of the size. avatars have to be 80x80 or less. if im right though now its been upped to 100x100 but i cant remember.If you need help just email me your avatar and i can get it to work for you. you should be able to just upload it though.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Anyways everyone, I have added one more picture to my gallery, and i call her Atolm, why? Cause i was too lazy to give her another name. I'll be adding another picture of Karnaim in a few moments..... Oh yea, I made this current avatar because i was bored and did not have anything else to do. What does everyone think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think your comic is fine as it is! I cant wait for the next one! Anyways, talk about first impressions eh?
</div>
<br />

<br />

<div id='container'>
Can a person consume so much cheese? Kinda like milk... you could only drink so much until you vomit...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Dunno if I can be of help, but a few names come to mind, with their meanings too.Etham- bouandry of the sea.Eglaim- Two poolsDarda- Pearl of wisdom.That is all that comes to mind right now. I have a giant book here that is filled with ancient names and their meanings. If anyone is looking for a particular name meaning, lemme know and I'll see what I can find.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wah! School starts soon! *slumps in a corner* Have fun for all of us will ya? *sniff*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You have fun! I remember when i first played it... Took me awhile to get use to the 3d controls..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What cracks me up when you look at yearbooks is that you look at all the young, thin popular people and then years later, they are overweight, balding and such. Has anyone else noticed this?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Spikes, cause that is what is on a hedgehog's back.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wish I could draw things that are pretty. My creatures end up looking hideous and not at all beautiful.Anyways, are you working on a story? I would like to read it.

<div id='container'>
Ecco 1...those spike things I hate :x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Neat :D____________________________________________________________Today I bought a book called "the Sight" by David Clement-Davies. I don't know why, but I just can't stop reading.... O-oIt's about a small pack of Wolves (a huge 500+ page book). Right now, I'm already on page 79. 8O It remainds me a bit on Vantid's "Etain" fanfic.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
um....there are dozens of possible senairos here
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lucky you *cries*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I don't think this topic has ever been discussed before.What would an Ecco movie be like? Although the chance of a movie being made is very small,let's pretend it was being made...How would you make it?  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You finally got it? I thought EVERYONE here had it by now. o_o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
8O  Wow Sten! That's so prettyful!!! (hehe it looks professional). Yeah, we all luv it!! You should probably enter this into the art contest when you have the chance ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
woah....*gazes at the monitor*...Hey Tethys.....HOW THE HELL DO YOU DO THAT?!! So many purty colors......heh looks really unique!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
And just for you atolmwink:
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
wow, the wings are very detailed! me luvs it! ^_^ It's so prettyful!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
woah totally feaky dude, it looks like it came straight out of resident evil or something...but the art is awsome!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well for starters, there is BOUND to be laods of CGI in it so I woulds suggest getting the best people in the world to work on that..... Square and Blizzard!  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The ribbons flying of the back is very unique, and it makes it look a lot more uhh....sophisticated? I dunno, I can't find the word but it looks awsome!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yay for Noriko! *cheers* I hope you enjoy it - the game is a tad bit difficult and yeah the controls would take a while to get use to....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The hell man......
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*Trelluis looks at Nekko's Sig and bursts out lauging* Nice one Neko! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wut about Electronic Arts or is that not worthy enough for good CG? Lots of dolphins that's all that I can imagine 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The people on here are good...real good, so I'll see if they can guess this &gt;)oerpteflrfheciolaresuhh... 5 words O_O
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
:D heeeheee
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You can also bet your buns its going to cost ALLOT to make, underwater life is some of the most vivid cenery in existence, and considering everything that happened to Ecco, re-creating that in believable detail is going to be expensive, hard and is shure to win tons of awards! wink:
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
now that I think about it, your face pic is origional too, Nice one there!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*Dammit Arkon! You been in my shrooms again?! The bags empty!!!!* 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yup.... ep004 is up, and Dawn is still her ol' self. ^_^ What do you think?Oh! And if you'd read the updates on the main page, you'll see Dawn talking about the crew's new e-mail addy. That's right! So, if you have the time and got a question or something, why don't you drop one of the crew a line? But she also mentions some other stuff in that update... like, a new comic perhaps?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
To answer an earlier question, someplace on COH said this.(PsySonic - 15. June 2002; 15 "Appaloosa is working on a sequel to Ecco the Dolphin for PS2."But I've learned not to get my hopes up over most things...As for Brin//www.davidbrin.com/for other exciting items. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
After a week of sitting next to a lake in Maine, I feel like doing some writing. Unfortunatly it went in the wrong direction.For the dolphin (Rising) storyline, I may rewrite a little of what I have changing (and possibly eliminating) the characters of Cassiopeia and Orion. As for the Orcarael (Sci-fi, post Rising) storyline, I have written out an entire historical outline which, someday, may became a very good backbone for writting the whole thing.Artreus has changed. Nothing in the Rising storyline, but originally the Orcarael were supposed to be able to shift between Orca and human. Later dolphins were added and Artreus could became either of the three. The last time I considered shifting, the Orcarael treated the ability as a prize. They would be awarded with new forms, mostly cetacean. Now I don't actively think of shape shifting as a realistic option, but the thought of a future Artreus with more elaborate stripe design and various coloring taken from the character Setra from SoR, such as deep purple shaded flanks with a little silver tossed in.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
All the neat stuff happens when I'm gone.  Cheese, Ecco, and just a touch of insanity, Arkonviox.com has it all.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This just goes to prove that very few people are able to leave Arkonviox.com without coming back.*Looks at member list*Okay, maybe not.It proves that you're one of those hardy souls that dares to survive Arkoviox.com a second time! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wow. O.o; I feel left out, too. I haven't been here for, like, four days. That's what I get. XD *grabs some Kraft singles*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yus, a dolphin with shades.  8O
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The problem is: what do you do when you beat it?Beating a video game is the worst thing you can do to it.Well, actually I can think of others, but how many people have access to a steamroller?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Super spiffy, Cal!! Great wings, I can't draw 'em that good!!

<div id='container'>
Sten Not yet; when did you send it?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Bwee! I made a new section of my site, made specifically for my CGs! Eventually, I'm going to CG all of my pics! ^^CG Page!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*scratches her head* This sounds pretty fun and all, but does it mean that all sorts of people can look up your entires or just a selected few? This sounds very interesting!You choose. Public, Friends only, and Private, so you can ramble anything you want without anyone seeing you. No one knows I'm there, so I leave all mine as public, in case anyone breaks all probability and happens to find my journal.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
um... I agree with Eoraptor.... Many thoughts come to mind... Sometimes i question the sanity of our webmaster here...  :?  hehe.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
birds. cause they fly in the sky.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
that kind of reminds me of the memorable words of dr. fluke hawkins at the end of MDK2: Armageddon..."You've just spent $50 for a game that has ended.... Fool... Sucker!"... this message brought to you by bioware... at least in DoF you have the level select option after you have beaten it so that you can replay any level you like. still, good news to hear, noriko! forgive me if this was mentioned sometime before, but is this the ps2 version? anyway, i'm sure you'll enjoy finally being able to play that long and, in some cases, quite difficult game! and at least you'll know where to come to find walkthroughs and vitalit guides, just in case of course. ;)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hmmmm... Perils of the coral reef?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
my thoughts would be the story line, it would have to be good enough to impress other than fans, graphics enough does not gurantee a good movie.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Behold the power of cheese!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XD! You guys rock! Anyways, this topic is starting to go crazy...&gt;.&gt; So let me say welcome back to Mr. Artreus! And another hello to OrcaCaller ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Lucky thing you... I dun even have a DC or a PS2... yet 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Actually, Atolm, graphics etc are vital for some movies, they are visual limits that everybody tries to break. I'd love to have them compose scores like the original Mega Drive music (in tune and such :) ) and the storyline should be like the original game, but with more twists to make it more eventful and not entily predictable.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, a dreamcast doesn't cost that much anymore. I think that was the reason why i got one... to play ecco and phantasy star.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ok... im just saying that while graphics may be good and all, it may not help bring crowds. I think of the  final fantasy movie.... graphics were gorgeous... but other than that, it lacked something. Thats all im saying.
</div>

^_^ Well, I'm enjoying myself so far. Played it a bit this morning. I'm at the level called...uhm....Perpetual Fliudity? I think? x_@ I probably got the name wrong, but oh well. Oh and yes, it's for PS2.  It's actually not that hard for me. ^__^ Very fun. (And when I beat it...I'll probably just keep playing it over again...either that or put it somewhere in my closet and forget about it for a couple years...*coughtidesoftimecough*) &gt;_&gt;;Oh yea, and Neo! I noticed you have a pic of Gir in your sig! XD! Right on!

What cracks me up when you look at yearbooks is that you look at all the young, thin popular people and then years later, they are overweight, balding and such. Has anyone else noticed this?XD! Too funny! But yes, it's true and I have noticed. Most of the time the young, thin popular people are total snobs though. So I say it's karma. =]

I also found another set, but there are some runes i dont recgonize at all... ill see what i can do.

only a day of playing and already you're at perpetual fluidity? what can i say but well done! however, i think when you start at this one, you may change your mind about that difficulty issue... i found perpetual fluidity quite the challenging level, having to change all those switches and then backtracking to switch some back... thank goodness the level after it, obscure ways to terminus, is beyond simple to complete... probably because the player had fried half their brain trying to figure out perpetual fluidity. O_x i wish you luck though on your quest to completing the game. you're already basically on your way to completing the first altered future.and thank you for noticing the pic of GIR there, noriko.  :D yes, rock on, little GIR dude... rock on.

hmmm I have no "in game" music at all in the PC ecco Kitnee sent me, even with Music checkboxed to "on" there is none.But The movies do have music, and from my observation it looks like there is no Music data on this CD at all (I explored it)so, how can this be fixed?

Well,this is how I would make it...-The storyline would be that of the first Ecco,but with added elements.Make it more cinematic.Perhaps have Brin add some things.-Live action (Real Dolphins,Sharks,ect.) mixed with CGI. I know that sounds unlikely,but if they can mix cartoons with reality,they can sure as hell do it with computer graphics.And Dolphins could be trained to easily perform some of the actions.They could always paint the stars on the Dolphin's head.   -Inner monolouge,with celebrity voices.To draw people in.-Action and Drama.-Tons of detail,let's make the film look fantastic.People will litarly go "Wow" when they see some of the scenes.-Animals talking with each other,of course.But don't make their mouths move,just telepathic.-Music could be pulled from the game,then orchestrated. By the same guy who did 'Jurassic Park'. Forgot his name......That's all I can think of for now.Damn,sucks that this movie may never be made...  :(

I hate to snap your bubble, but thats what I'm going to do.Well,this is how I would make it...-The storyline would be that of the first Ecco,but with added elements.Make it more cinematic.Perhaps have Brin add some things.Brin couldn't screenwrite his way out of a paper bag on this one. You'd have Ecco mixed with bad anime screenwriting.-Live action (Real Dolphins,Sharks,ect.) mixed with CGI. I know that sounds unlikely,but if they can mix cartoons with reality,they can sure as hell do it with computer graphics.What you're talking about is almost pure CG work, months of it, and for somewhat of a baked finish on the end product.And Dolphins could be trained to easily perform some of the actions.They could always paint the stars on the Dolphin's head.   Dolphins are not cheap. Dolphin trainers are not cheap. Insurance and wrangler staff are not cheap. Federal permits are not easy to get.Getting dolphins to do exactally what you want consistantly and repeatably is not trivial.-Inner monolouge,with celebrity voices.To draw people in.-Action and Drama.A Action, yes. Drama? I can't think of too many places where you could put drama.Really, this would be suited best to a 20-30 minute IMAX film. That could be interesting. The rest of this is well, blah.

-WARNING-Before you load this movie, please note that the file size is 7mb download which usually takes 15 minutes on a good 56k modem. The reason the file size is so big is cuz of somethin that went wrong when animating, and before i noticed the problem, i was half way done with the movie so there wasnt much i could do about the file size. So i regret to say that its a short movie for such a big file size. But if you truly want to see All int he family's 1st episode in its presentation in flash you'll load it for sure.It took 4 days work to make this movie and it was pretty fun aside from the file size being to big for its running time, but still i hope you enjoy the first episode of my 10 part flash series - All in thje family!http://www.arkonviox.com/aitf/01.htmlAnyways, i asure you the next 9 episodes will be smaller file sizes now that i know what the problem was. But as of now, im takin a break and gunna do some face pics till i make episode 2 later on.

if you downloaded or kidnee sent it to you on a burnt disk it probably didnt come with the music burned on it too. i think it might be kinda hard to burn the music in. the ecco pc is part cd track part pc track. it uses normal cd music for the game. im sure most people dont know how to burn them together but im not saying its impossible. so to answer your question your kinda screwed unless you can reburn the cd with the audio tracks.

I think it would be good, if they put allot of effort into it. With CGI they can make the dolphins do near impossable things the way they want them to and no one gets hurt. Exept maybe the programmer when he misses his deadline.....

i go for more action and adventure. theres a such thing as too much story and too much dialog which take from those things. i think the old eccos had a good balance of both where defender of the future has too much story.

Hanging waters is the best, I've beaten it several times and it still is fun. And yeah, you can't get through it unless you've fallen out of the water atleast once (that pissed me off so badly the first time I played it).Hey Noriko, I saw that Dotf for PSX2 was how much? 29.99? I think dreamcast is only 49.99 now and ecco is 10 bucks, I think you'd save more money on the dreamcast....

My history is very clouded and mysterious.I was once part of the race known as the Atlanteans.When I walked the earth,Atlantis was a lush city,existing above and below the waves.My kind walked on land,dolphins lived in the section under water.My kind could swim very well,but were not as well adapted to aquatic life as our brothers,the dolphins.When Atlantis was being destroyed,the great Delphineus took those of us that were still alive.                    He transformed us for a life below the waves.The majority of my kind allowed their minds to be clensed of the carnage they had witnessed.As such,their skins turned from the delightful blue we were so proud of to snowy white.Because of our tie with the dolphins,our new appearance was similiar to them.However,our heads were larger and we had no dorsal fin.We became the Belugas.I cannot let go of the horror which I have experienced.As such,my pectoral fins are as large as those of a manta ray.My colouration,too,is different.I am brown with white markings.The humans that live on land call me "Okapi".I am aware of a beast by that name that lives in the forests on land.That is my name now.All who knew my Atlantean name are dead.I am an outsider,an excess left from a forgotten time.I will reveal more of my people's tale of destruction soon enough.

Yup,that would be Ecco's main basis.Action and Adventure.I certaintly agree that sometimes there is TOO much drama.That's what ruined 'Signs' for me.Too much talk,not enough creepiness. 8O BUT there would have to be moments where Ecco would need to talk to other Dolphins,and know what's going on.Just as long as it's not campy. You know,no "You are great".

Well, as I wait for Crestoe's movie to load, i might as well say something about my character. A special thanks for Neoecco for helping me piece it together! :) Atolm came from a world that no longer exists, dying when its sun reached its final stages and went supernova. To know Atolm and her behaviors, is to know her old world and customs. A human like race once thrived there, but they were cruel to their world, driving many species to extinction. Some felt guilty about what they did and recreated crude clones of the animals. Others took advantage of this and used the new creatures to do their battles, Atolm's species, the Shamgar, is one such race. There are two types of Shamgar, one with the giant horn, and one without it. The one with the horns lead the hornless ones to attack their foes. Atolm comes to the story not knowing about her old world and she wonders why she is in this one. She does not look like any other creature and feels alienated in the seas. As she tries to cope  that she is the only one left of her kind, she also tries to bury her natural urge to destroy... something that is not always succesful... There are times were she will be cruel and not even know it.Two others are in this story, one, who helps Atolm calm her rage (somewhat) and the other, who wants to use her for his own ideas. These two are also from this old world, both with different ideas about this one. Anyways, this is a partial idea... dunno if it is any good though....

Wow I forgot all about this for a while.Well just as long as one person says sure and no one says no.  I already mentioned the book title if you wanna look for it.Oh, and I never actually read this section before, but here's the section on Ichthyosaurs, word for word ICTHYOSAURS the swimming reptilesOf all the marine reptiles, ichthyosaurs--whose name means "fish lizard"--were the most fully adapted to life in the sea.  They even gave birth to live young in the water, instead of laying eggs, and fossil skeletons of adults have been found with the tiny bones of babies still inside them.Ichthyosaurs lived much like today's dolphins.  They were strong swimmers and cruised the open seas of the world, feeding on fish and squid.  They had a fishlike tail which moved from side to side, much as the tail of a modern shark or tuna, pushing the body through the water.  At about 49 feet, Shonisaurus was the largest known ichthyosaur; most were smaller.  Ichthyosaurus was about 6 feet long.Unlike other ichthyosaurs, Eurhinosaurus had an extremely long upper jaw, with teeth sticking out sideways along its length.  It is not known exactly what this strange jaw was for but it could have been used to probe the mud or sand of the seabed for food such as shrimp or octopus.  It could also have been swung rapidly from side to side as Eurhinosaurus swam through a school of fish, stunning and wounding them as it past.Ichthyosaurus was fast and agile in the water, diving through the waves in search of prey.  But although well adapted for swimming, it was still a reptile and had to comr to the surface to breathe air.  The nostrils were set far back on the snout near the eyes so the animal only had to raise its head to the surface of the water to take a breath.(drawing of an Ichthyosaurus and a dolphin)A streamlined body, and strong tail and back fins, helped Ichthyosaurus swim at more than 25 miles an hour.  The fast-swimming modern dolphin has a similar body shape.

I'm not sure what I think of the whole dialouge thing.  I mean it would be boring without any dialouge at all, of course, and it might be confusing to anyone who's never played the game.  And there was dialouge in the game, even if it wasn't much.  The only problem with dialouge is it could end up turning into another "talking animals" movie.I've read books that had very little dialouge and were still very exciting.  Of course books have narration.  But I imagine that would be too much of a problem in a movie as long as you can plainly see what's going on.  Altho it would also be a good idea to have some of the things that Ecco is thinking to himself so you know how he's feeling.And as for the dolphins and everything, what about animatronics?  I would think it would be less expensive than using cg for all the animals, altho I really don't know.  The only thing is you wouldn't want it to end up looking like the lion in Jumangi or Salem the cat in Sabrina.  I would suggest the Jim Henson Creatur Shop for this because they usually do a really good job with that sort of thing.And as for the scenery, a good portion could just be filmed in the ocean somewhere.  Just the same way they film stuff for documentaries on underwater life (and they can film stuff that's really deep, I once saw something on those strange creatures that live on the bottom of the ocean near those vents).  If it's just based on the first game, there's only the parts in prehistoric waters and Atlantis to worry about.  But you could still film in an actual location, and then just alter the appearance with CG.  Or, it COULD just be a cartoon....but I dunno how many fans would go for that.

I think that an Ecco film should be more in-depth than Jurrasic Park.Take "Dragonheart",for example.It had a basic plot that Draco and Bowen were trying to overthrow their brutal king and restore peace and justice.However,it also had a hidden agenda,concerning the relationship between Draco and Bowen.For an Ecco film,it should have a basic plot,like Ecco fighting to save the world against a terrible alien menace.However,it should also have an undercurrent running through it,like how Ecco responds emotionally to all that he experiences.         In my story,"Tides Of Time(Alternate Version)",I have this going on in it.That story is at the Caverns Of Hope.I might put it on here when it's finished.I'm definitely gonna put my next story on this website.Chcek the TOT one and let me know wot u think of it.

Well, thats the whole thing about movies and such these days, they're all about money - and people focus way too much on a 'good' story and diologue, or should we say too much dialogue....Did any of you see Spirit? They had a smart thing here, where when the animals communicated between eachother, it was their natural sounds, and you got Matt Dameon doing the thoughts of Spirit. None of this talking-with-mouth-movement crap. Doing something like that would be effective in means of dialogue for Ecco himself - but messages from other dolphins could be just like the FMV in Ecco II CD, when he communicated with others, you got the ripple through the waters to show the sonar paturn. Then you got images showing him of these things. Screw the images and give the dolphins 'telekinetic' voices - hell, its how they normally communicate - why not take it a step further for hollywood and add in somebody to do the speech of them *coughs*. Well, and for the vortex, they could speek in they're own language - and we have prettiful subtitles put in so we know what they're saying. Think Atlantis the Lost Empire - and LoTR, when they spoke Atlantean and Elven.My 2 cents...

<br />

<div id='container'>
you'll have to find somone with the game, being an Old game it will burn well (Like my WOLF sim) so....now who -has- it?write to sega pc, I see the sonic pack at staples all the time"hey get Ecco the Dolphin" I say *cries*I'll try again?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Stupid postal service.....two weeks now and no one got there crap!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Damn, Crest! That movie was awesome! The flash work was excellent and the sound was good quality too. Keep it up! I can't wait for the full meal deal!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
How in the HECK did you get it to look like that? The coloring is... AMAZING!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Love the music! heh heh heh heh heh....  very coo...=)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, someone is a bit off.o_O;;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
not even dotf can warrant the purchase of a system for the sole purpose of playing only one game on it. I'd pick up a ps2, it would see more use in the long run anyways.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, i know how it is thinking people wont like your product. Thats how i usually feel with my All in the family flash movie since i wasnt sure if people would likee what i did with it, plus ive lost quite a bit of recognition with alotta people here but you'll be suprized. If you know its good and you like it then most likely people will like it. Just gotta reasure yerself.Personally i think your CAD product is excellent, and all of yer characters have different perspectives so it works out just fine i think. Keep it up. This is somethin we need to keep around an be more recognized. :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aparently trellius has never heard of a foul demon commonly refered to  as constipation! duh duh duh!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Though if he really did eat all that cheese I have no doubt that he is rapidly becoming familiar with it...........=)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanx! It was really fun to work on. Although i didnt get to add all off the things i wanted cuz of the rediculous file size, i was sure that there was enough stuff in there for soemone to find something they liked. Episode 2 which ill work in again in aa month or so will continue from their, as always.But as of right now, i need to follow up on this with its own website. So be on the lookout for AITF.arkonviox.com.In the meantime, i got some face pics to do. Glad you enjoyed it. This is episode 1 of a 10 part series. Plenty more installed for ya gradually over time. :DOh, and i was happy to see Alastor and Yogoat liked it, it DOES star them,  so damn right.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have the Sonic CD game.  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
And i wasnt informed of this? Heads will roll....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thats freaky....In otherwords, its damn awesome.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
HOLY SHIT, Neko!!!! Super mega spiffy!!!!  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Actually, I did get a slip from the postals today, 'cause I was at the hospital today. They must have come by while I was away.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This very forum, because it seems that cheese comes up a lot here! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Some very disturbed human beings... because that's about all you find in this forum. 0_o;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The problem with the server has been resolved. D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yayness!! ^.^ I was wondering about the site.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
And yet another thank you to all my new friends...or rather all my new somethings...lol wink:
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm a puppet show with socks... simple and yet effective!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Unfortunatly for me, the site could not be found... so i cannot offer anything to say... sorry....  :(
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Where did this cheese trend come from anyway? What is the story behind it?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hello!! ohh, a resident evil fan, yay!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I placed some new pictures i did in the fanfare section not too long ago. Basically these are some creatures that i decided to draw out of the top of my head one night, so i wanted to share it with all of you and i would love to hear your input! I  am sorry to say that i dont quite know how to put pictures in this forum. I remember asking about that somewhere in this forum, but i have yet to see any answers.Anyways, take a look at my new stuff, i would love to hear from everyone!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heres a quick link to get to her art gallery.Click hereThose are some awesome creatures atolm. if i could say i had a favorite id be This one. ;)Anyways i just wanted to say i love the strange creatures there awesome. its way different from what im used to seeing. thats what makes it interesting   
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
interesting....I have to admit i like your avatar.   Anyways welcome to the site! i must admit your the most interesting new person i've seen here for some odd ball reason. looking forward to seeing you around. heh*sips some tea*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I've seen Spirit - and I agree with Callyfin - It's a smart thing to do. hehe, sock puppets?  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah, a play.who here has the vidio crap to upload movies?a long time ago, me and some friends put on a LionKing play using the action figures.it was longer than the movie.  well, because pride rock fell of the couch
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah... the joys of Resident Evil. Hey there, Jill! Nice to 'meet' you!Think you could introduce me to Chris sometime? Heh heh heh... just joking!Welcome anyway!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Perpetual Fluidity in ONE day? Jesus, it took me like... half a year to get there...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's okay, she has a 24/7 'reassuring person' right here... funny thing is, she never listens to me, even when I'm RIGHT. And I'm ALWAYS right.... :o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ecco movie? Um... no, I don't think so. Ecco makes a good video game, a good fanfic character, and a good character to draw. But otherwise, I say leave a good enough thing alone. They make movies of video games all the time and they blow major rat shit. So I say leave Ecco alone.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
EC! Done any more composing lately?! Nice to see you back!!!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
How about Clan Macleod? That way you could say something like "I"m Duncan Macleod of the Clan Macleod!"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Anyone got it yet? I'd like to beaten by someone who I can place a name, avatar and personality to. =)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oh, you know it, Kit! XD *bellows like a gorilla*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
O_O Didju just say I was un-spiffy?! *cries and clings to Mr. Artreus and Kitnee* um. Just kidding. e.x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
e.e I'm sorry. I like to play video-games, what can I say? ^_^ But I haven't had much chance to play it lately, what with everything that's been going on...my brother came out for a few days and stuff. ^_^ Probably go back to trying to get past Perpetual Fluidity today. o_o I have nothing better to do. It's just that those stupid sharks piss me off. x_x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^__^ Welcome welcome, Jill! ^.^ I'm Noriko. Hope to see you around, eh? These forums tend to grow on you after a while. =] Anyways, just wanted to say hi! Oh, and give you some cheese-whiz. Can't forget the cheese-whiz. *gives her some cheese-whiz* =D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
o.o Noriko likes cheese. XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
not even dotf can warrant the purchase of a system for the sole purpose of playing only one game on it.Oh, was I not supposed to do that?The sole purpose of my PS2 was to play DotF. Of course, they still make other games for the PS2. Of which, I have one. It'll be worth it eventually.(Just the rumor I was picking up a PS2 started a war between the PSX and Xbox fans within my school  )
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XD! Hehe. Oh, woopsies. Seems I forgot to address that issue. &gt;.&gt; Anyways, that's alright. I got my Ps2 basically for DotF and FFX. o_o That was about it. And possibly a hockey game if I see one. Or something. But yea, because I think Ps2's are better than Xbox.  They can play dvds. =D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okie! I think I'm going to call her race "Cealda". um. 'Cuz it sounds cool. Kind of combining the two words Cealin(Trellius suggested) and Darda(Atolm suggested). I have no idea what Cealin means, but it sounds cool. =] And I like Darda because of the pearls of wisdom bit. So yay! Noriko now has a name for her race of people.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
:| If I went through the names I've used...Nothing I write is concrete. The original storyline I came up with is incredibly different than the current. The only two characters that survived the time are Artreus Hayson and Lin Coler. Don't look for Lin, she's not in the Rising storyline. Maybe someday... 8O No, I won't mess things up more than I already have.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was bored the other day, and I just started sketching a picture...and I turned it into what I thought Stenellya would look like if she were a member of Noriko's race (which I have just recently named Cealda). So then I made Doomtrain! And I'll be doing some more...I was just wondering if you guys would like to see them when I'm done...? ^_^ It's just some thing I'm goofing with.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Revision is your friend, Mr. Artreus. =] My friend's sister told me that. She's been working on this story about King Arther and stuff since like...10th grade (she's in college now) and the story plot has changed so many times. O_O
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oh, yea I have. I will have to catch you in the chat to give it to ya!  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You know what Noriko's race looks like, right? Like, fish people with fin-like ears and shiz? Yea.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds like a good idea. Until I teach myself to draw well all I have to go on is the talent of others. So I say go for it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

I got the new Illmatic skin up. its the new look for this website. the only problem is not all the pages were converted to use postnuke and illmatic.anyways im sure most of you might not be seeing so heres how you can.http://arkonviox.com/user.phpthat will take you to your account and from there you have to change the skin.you can also choose the old look. its there as an option.Crests been bugging me about getting it up so i got it done to make him quit his bitching. I hope everyone likes it crest did an awesome job!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay then what is the defination of spiffy in your own words?  :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I wouldn't mind seeing it, not at all. hehe, maybe you could try my character.. *thinks for a moment* uh, have you seen my character?Not exactly a pretty thing.... D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
uh... x-box's play dvd's too.Oh yes, the bitter war between x-box and the ps2. Im kinda neutral, and i hang out a lot at a funcoland in this area. so i see plently of arguments. things i notice between the systems.ps3 is coming out in five years, so another expensive system is coming up. X-box has a thing that allows one to change their chip  upgrades without having to but another systems. (i heard about this, can anyone confirm it?)the clerks have told me that many people have came in to sell their ps2 and they bought an x-box instead.i would really like to play ffx, i am a final fantasy fan afterall. But i heard that the game is so short, and the majority of it is movies. i want to play it myself, so i can give it my opninion, but.... i only know one person with a ps2... and he is stubborn... everyone else has an x-box... puppydogeyes:
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i can easily get it, but i have never fought anyone online.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oh i love to play as chris! have you tired code veronica yet? im currently playing that one!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oh.. purdy!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I agree.  If anyone wants to make an Ecco movie, make it Flash or something from anyone here, or maybe about anyone here.But no professional stuff!  Otherwise Ecco is a dead dolphin 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Everyone likes cheez!You have to be strange to not like cheez!anyway...disturbed human beings...It's not on this, but the first word to pop in my head was "cake" after this one. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This one's neat, Arkon!   :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That movie was SO FUNNAY!  Especially the part with Alastor and the horse.  It's so cool you use the opening to Hamtaro...uh...not that I watch that. 8)   ugh...okay, I do!Anyways, great job.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
We have Ecco Dotf for the PS2...actually my bro does.  And he refuses to share.It's like, "it's both ours, not yours!  Shaddap, I'll have a file if I dang want to!  it was my idea in the first place, you don't even like Ecco!"Well, anyway, I got to Transfiguration now.  And forget Hanging Waters, he was the first to beat it, didn't swear once.  Me, I was almost there. :P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I plan to do a big update soon, and I am going to fix the spelling of "Environment", as suggested, use a more scientific comparison to compare the Beta ROM to the Final, upload some of the screenshots Eoraptor sent me, and so forth.Does anyone have suggestions for what else I should add/fix?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
woooo, nice...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I try to at least say welcome to anyone that's new to the forum.So, "Welcome!"::
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The first thing that popped into your head was "cake"?!er....German Chocolate, cuz it's my favorite kind.  :D

I have just joined the first MUD that I've ever been in.  I've only played it 3 times and I'm already addicted.  Which means that with as little as I've been around lately, I'll probably be around even less now.  At least until I get tired of it, IF I ever get tired of it.Anyway, this MUD is called Eternal Struggle and I suggest you check it out, whether or not you have any experience in MUDs (the people there are nice and very helpful which is great for those with little or no experience). The website is http://www.esmud.com/Oh, and apparantly not all MUDs are meant for RP, but this one is.I took an old character of mine that I used to use in an AOL chatroom RPG called Rhydin and just made a few small changes to fit the world of ES.  If you do join or are already a member and if you want to try to find me, just pm me and I'll give you a couple of clues (because that's the only thing I -can- do).
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Indeed, I noticed it the second I came on, good job!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That was....just.....weird.....I liked it! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
awww, then we miss out on it...? 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^_^ heh. Yea, I'm gonna need a pic of ya. (I dunno what Atolm looks like) Also, if any of the guys want one...um...it might take a bit longer. Hehe. -^_^- I have this wee little problem while drawing guys...they always turn out too girly. So I'll be taking a little more time with them then the girls. e_C But other than that! I'm having fun. I drew Kitnee this morning. XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
In my own words? Well, I use it as a substitute for cool. e_e
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol. Well...I didn't know x-boxes could play dvds. *shrug* Now I do, I guess. =] Oh, um....Final Fantasy X...not...that great. -_- I couldn't really get into the story like I did with the other ones. And some of the characters just pissed me off. Like...Tidus. And Yuna was obnoxious. I didn't like her. Currently, the game is sitting on my dresser, collecting dust. Maybe I'll put in mah Ps2 and play it sometime...but...most likely not. x_x Oh, and I'm gonna play DoTF today, too. Gotta get past stupid Perpetual Fluidity. -_@ I hate those switches.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Where did this cheese trend come from anyway? What is the story behind it?No, seriously. It started because I like cheese.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I noticed it, too! First words outta my mouth: "Woah." lol. In other words, I like it and awesome job!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey spiffy! I would want some Ecco stickers. o_o 'Ecco adhesive goodness.' XD (How do you spell adhesive? Did I get it right?)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oops....I did something to mess it up sorry...ok, try again - and thanks u guys! *hugs*  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
wow It looks nice Arkon!  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hehe that's true, if ecco went into theatres do you think he'll make it out there? uh uh...I think the people would think it's stupid cuz when it comes to movie to these peeps they can get real picky
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Perpetual Fluidity? I quited a couple days on Ecco when I couldn't get pass it. My bro was having a hard time to pick PSX or X-box. He thought that X-box had stupid upcoming games while PSX had the better (hey this is my bro not me I thought X-box wasn't that bad). He probably only got it cuz of FFX and the squaresoft RPGs but then there wasn't really ANY good rpgs on PSX2 (cept for upcoming Kingdom Hearts maybe...) I read out of EGM that X-box is making this thing that you could pause in T.V. Something like an X-box 2! Anyways, I prefer PSX 2, not cuz everyone else likes or hates it, it's just me  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
and - Oh yes, the FFX obnoxious characters, and tidus was an annoying winer. But he got out of it while in the end :P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Is Perpetual Fluidity that hard? x_@ I played a bit yesterday, but had to stop 'cuz we were going out. I got the water to rise. o_o But I was kinda stuck on where to go from there. I went back to the beginning place and then the water went down again! &amp;C*0um85uac-. I practically killed my controller. o_o Oh well. One more try today.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
and - Oh yes, the FFX obnoxious characters, and tidus was an annoying winer.XD! He was! I wanted to kick him. o_o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Nah, Nori your "spiffy"  :) I'll put that word in my vocabulary then.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Wierd, its kinda like that game Dolphins been playin. -_-
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Of course we'd love to see it Noriko! Who wouldn't pass on the chance to? wink:
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I only got starcraft...not installed...im bad at it. ._.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Warcraft 3? I haven't played it yet, but I will sometime when my brother ever beats it. I just watch him. if you wanna battle on diablo, then ask me bro, all his characters are lvl. 99 so...it'll be a challenge!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Indeed. It gives me a error too. Like all that geocities hosted images.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm glad you guys like it. I have been workig on changes to the forum as well. to make it more match the look. i have it 75% complaete and for right now im gonna take a break. been working o it all morning which kinda sucks.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah and perhalps we can give your site and forum some more hits too. maybe get some more techical minded people here to help you on your rom quest.I made a link to your site on my main page so that should relly give things a boost.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
there probably gonna be problems with the forum like things not loading right such as images and maybe even text showing up wierd.Its not a big problem but i will have it fixed sometime. right now i need to relax doing these new skins takes alot out of me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
that actualy sounds interesting eao. it just takes time to create designs for such things. i mean look at my online store. it kinda lacks great things. i havent recevied one check for the 20 dollar boxer shorts o_o;;; maybe its too cheap?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
no one visits tthe chat. everyone just seems to not get along with yogoat. I wonder why o_o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Me niether. Lets get out of here. o_o;*flee*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i swear those games are dangeriously addictive. if theres anything thats killing my site right now tis online games. too bad ecco's not an online game. appaloosa better start trying to figure out whats cool and what not.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I damaged the forum almost beyond repair so i had to use my last back up which was from two days ago. Sad to say anything that was posted recently is all gone along with members who signed up. I made the mistake because i was trying to upgrade the forum and postnuke and accidently deleted the forum database.I almost had to relie on dolphin to fix it but i did it. yeah yeah it was stupid. im pretty mad about it but at least we still have our forum. we were so close to losing it for good.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Awesome picture. ^_^Oh...for those of you who might not know the trick with geo shitties.... when ya go www . geocities. com / blah blah blah...to see an image, just get rid of the damn w's. (E.G// geocities.com/ etc etc etc )works...most of the time anyway. :P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It's okay Arkie. At least you were able to save the forum.   :D

If we are on the subject of drawing each other's characters and such. Then I would not mind oing the same thing as well. I know that Friecco wanted me to do one of him.

ARGH post got deleted, trying againHere's my characters story K'shid has three forms second two being the legacy of the evolutionary virus/parasite that integrated with his dna. Each transformation is accompanied by horrible agony.As a dolphin K'shid has less circumference and slightly less length then the average dolphin. He is olive green on his back, white on the belly. Black vortex exoskeleton has fused into his skin in a few places, running in long strips past his dorsal fin. The tips of his ventral fins are razor sharp, as are his teeth. His tongue is long and thin, like a lizards. This, along with increased sensitivity and range of motion in his throat, forces him to eat in a thrashing motion, like a shark. His blowhole, no longer useful, is gone, its function replaced by gills on his side, each protected by chitin.In this form he has all the abilities of a normal dolphin, except he breathes water. He also has extraordinary ability to blast with his sonar, matching eccos.In his vortex form he resembles the snakelike vortex enemies in tides of time (they're in lunar bay). His head is shaped the same as a dolphins although it is made up of chitin (or whatever the vortex exoskeleton is made of). His tail ends in a poisonous stinger. Small manipulative claws adorn the underside of his first segment.In human form he is thin and muscular, average height with very light brown skin and uncontrollable jet black hair. In this form too, vortex exoskeleton has fused with his skin in places, mostly along his shins and forearms. Personality: His often frightening appearance belies a strong sense of ethics and a very intelligent mind. All things come at a price, however. K'Shids price is the ability to bond with other dolphins, or indeed almost anyone. His only true friend is the asterite, and even the ancient being describes him as "Hard to read." Most dolphins find him cold, intense and silent. Little ones of all species show no such fear, however. K'Shid is convinced that the vortex weren't/aren't entirely evil, merely desperate for food. If there are any survivors on the vortex planet he plans to teach them how to fend for themselves, without their machines to provide for them.He has two surnames. In vortex form he is called 1Krrrrzzzzzzdt1 and in human form he is called "Sid". Both are variants on his delphine name.Well what do you guys think? what needs improving? This is so cool. we should start an rpg.

I wrote a prelude for the ecco the dolphin novel. As you can see, it is in primitive stages. some words aren't used correctly, and some parts sound awkward, which is why I need some constructive critisism. What needs to be changed? Where does grammar need fixing? what should I elaborate on? it is meant to be a short narrative, and not very long, but i need a bit of help. Also, if you think its good, these comments are welcome as well

Hey. I am back. I just got home from BC, and let me say it was awesome. I spent all my time in the sea, so I did not have time for anything else. I told Arkon I would finish my story, but I guess I lied. Oh well. We saw a grey whale in the water very close to us when we went camping, and he hovered in the area for a week or so before leaving. I wanted to visit Sea world, but didn't have the time...it is unfortunate. As for other stuff, Ecco for GBA comes out Sept 3, which is also the first day of school for me. a good thing and a bad thing all in one day, so they kind of cancel eachother out. I am glad to be back, and I hope to redeem my place in the forums, and pollute them with boring information. i missed Arkonviox.com

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Might as well say something about myself too.For those of you who didn't read my profile on the Fanworks area...My character, Cariu, is almost like any other orca, although born in a far, far future of Earth.  Hardly any humans roam the lands anymore, after the continents collided again and the lands were partly destroyed.  Oceans were much larger and more free now than ever before.In this time, few cetaceans remain also.  Many were hunted down by humans, as but nusances to their oceanic discoveries; and some preferred to stay out of sight.  Orcas still live in two separate ways, Residential and Transient.Cariu was a transient whom was one of the very few to carry within the power of metamorphosis.  Once she harnessed her power, she could become animals just as powerful on land or air.  She also disliked eating other cetaceans, and so was quite rejected.  She continues to live a loner's life now, and has made few good friends.  I have a story about her in progress, and I'm planning on making it a trilogy, but I have to put it in paper first.  When I'm done with Book One, I'll send it here!  Lucky you, huh? 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the two people i griped about this to said it "is a good thing"and "mabye they have anti pronography zoning laws"but if so, that would be mentioned in the artical.  They are just bitching because "comic books are a childrens toy" and "there is a children school close by"Crestoe and Arkon better watch out these idiots don't sue them for there crude cartooning.

<div id='container'>
Og god, that is the most ridiculous crap I've ever heard.  What about movies, eh?  Video stores that have porn sections?  It's okay for them to have their erotic stuff, and I have no qualms with that (as my parents OWN a video store) but that thing with comics is simply idiotic.  Some movies are made to appeal to children (of course!) but are they ONLY for children?  No!How about books?  Some are made to appeal to children, but are they specifically for them? No!What imbeciles, comics aren't only for kids.  And besides, the explicit ones were hidden from kids' view, so what's the freakin' problem?For many reasons do I hate America.  The only one I like is freedom--or do people have even that anymore?

<div id='container'>
Hey Phosis, thats pretty interesting! =) Right, I'd like to start off by saying that I think the novel is a grand idea. =) BUT, unless you are attempting to hide its presence from the general public, I'd recomend this post be moved to the general board. More comments that way.  "The universe has witnessed the destruction of thousands upon thousands of galaxies, their systems of planets falling into the vast nothingness that is...(blah blah blah)" I dunno, seems kinda extreme, and isn't quite the same. =) Next sentence perhaps ebb would help. ebb and flow, ya know?Moving on.They were a bipedal species of mammal here, called humans. For millions of years, they evolved, from single celled organisms, to become the most intelligent species ever known. They built cities, and created political diversity. They conquered lands unknown, and discovered the mystery of the sea.First of all, "There was a bipedal species of mammal there..."named humans instead? We humans like to think that we named ourselves. =)"they evolved, from single celled organisms" remove comma between evolved and from."the most intelligent species ever known"? hmm...hope not. =)"They built cities, and created political diversity. " too short. add to next sentence or add to it.what mystery of the sea? details would be helpful.It was in this darkness that was found a species of great curiosity. They had a language through song. They dove deep to find fish, yet breathed on the dry side. In the sky they could soar, if only for a short time, high as a bird. And they were intelligent. "of great curiosity" sounds odd. "found a curious species" perhaps? fascinating even...dry side, nice touch...hmm...bothers me somehow though...maybe someone else can place it. =) Everything else I like. Nice dolphin description! but, what about "and they were named dolphin" or something to that effect. in the next paragraph, it seems as though you 'missed' something by jumping to the name Dolphin so quickly. =)ack...too lazy to continue... ._.Maybe someone else could pick up where I left off? If not, I'll continue later. =) Despite what it appears Phosis, I really did like it, I'm just picky.  :D

It's good you saved it. Of course, ut had to happen the day I actually get around to checking all of the boards, and replying to more the one topic.   Piss... oh well. ^_^ It's good you had your little backup. Fuck if I have to sign up again. @_@

Hey Phosis! Welcome back! Welcome back to cow town too. ^_- Yeah... we have to go back to school soon. Piss. At least you got away for the month! I was stuck in summer school with the shit weather we were havine. It was... shit. Felt like winter! It was fucking cold in the mornings, right after that heat wave we got.But anyways... yes, yes, welcome back! I'm gald you had a good time. Lucky bastard... sounds like a lot of fun! A house by the beach... that'd be so nice. I'm coming with next time. ^_-

Very Helpful! I noticed a few of those, but you brought a lot of errors to my attention. (the whole "They were a great species here" Was really bad, but I noticed it after arkon posted   ) The dry side thing was taken directly from the game, when cassandra is in the big meeting. In the tot instructions. Maybe it would be better off left out, but I will wait until more comments come up about it. The fact is, it is obvious this prelude needs to be touched up a lot. My intentions of posting it were to give you guys a little preview, and to do what we are doing; reviewing it, and helping it out. I am gonna keep doing this with every chapter, and every bit until all the bugs are worked out and everyone is happy. then I will rewrite taking all errors into account, review it over once more to make sure I have everything, and then write it all out again into a perfect copy. could take ages, but I have that much time to spend.anywaysI thought about adding a "they were called the dolphin" line, but i didnt feel it was necessary, as the next paragraph tells the reader. But I think you are right. something to the effect of, "They were called the dolphin, and they (blah blah blah blah blah  Havent thought up the rest)" Which i think will help the break.  As for humans being the most intelligent species, this is obviously not true. Dolphins are more intelligent in many ways, and you are right. this needs to be changed. I suppose the naming of humans is suitable....I had always had trouble with this. we know the atlantians were human, but in the game, they never called themselves that. Should the word human be omitted entirely? Some parts are to short....and some parts need punctuation as well. Thanks a lot alastor. This gives me a much clearer idea of what needs changing. Of course, more help from everyone is necessary, and I would like to move this thread to general, though i dont know how. I am also afraid that this topic will get out of hand, and will be subject to many lines such as "Phosis, I didnt know you were jewish!!" "Next topicwink:

Like I said before it got deleted...An Ecco movie would be really cool! I'd be neat with real dolphins and all that, but I'd really like it if it was totally computer generated like the games. It'd definatly be the nicest looking movie in a long time, with all those lush background and all that. And with the new technology they got from the Final Fantasy movie, it'd probably look brilliant! I always like the computer generated movies, because for some reason it just interestests me on how they make em'. Like the movie Dinosaure... it looks so good!

Hey, thanks. Cow town ain't so bad. Just the lack of a salt water source that makes me want to live in BC. Oh well. I can just fill the kiddie pool with water and tablesalt, and maybe throw a couple rocks and poisonus jellyfish in their (Which we saw a LOT of while swimming. One swam across my cousins foot.) and Ill have a good time. School is not so great of course...I despise my school. bunch of punks. But hey, if you can stand the excruciating 14 hour bus trip, and my bickering, gossiping family, then by all means, come along next time   Maybe you will fare better then I did. (Got yelled at by my aunt for an hour. No reason really. she was just mad.  :? )

Well, I'll just say it again... I love all the pics Atolm! My favorite would have to be the sichem! The design is wicked! I love the Karnaim and Atolm dudes too. They all have a really cool look about em'. They're like... well, cool! The shading and detail are really good too. Keep it up!

<div id='container'>
Ha ha! Sorry to go back on topic... but you did those in MS Paint?! That's insane! I didn't think that program was good for anything! There's so much detail in those little things... O_O Aaamaaaaazing...........
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
CG might be good, if they were careful. CG can look REALLY bad as well. A fully animated one in my mind is a good idea, maybe using some japanese artists. (Jap anime, though i dont like the stories all that often, is really very good looking.) Other then that, a real life thing might be kinda odd.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That is... absolutly AMAZING!!! The coloring is brilliant!! What did you do that in? It looks almost hand painted! God... that is really good! I think you and the program Painter would get along just perfect! You should... look into that.  8) *stares at the picture some more* Woooooow.............

Dont forget arkonviox's pattented boxer shorts which no one has bought yet! I seriously beleive some sort of ecco convention should take place. we have enough people here in cowtown for a shabby one....well, it would probly consist of playing ecco and eating poorly made pizza's from panago (just because I am to cheap to pay for anything better)

Thank you so much! Im so glad to hear such wonderful  comments. As some of you may know I'm also doing pics of some of you folks here! I have started on a few already. Maybe  I'll eventually do all the characters. I'm teaching myself to do photoshop but that is going to take awhile.

well, we all love ecco music. and some of us play instruments...and i was thinking about this the other day when cally played some midis for me. what if there was sheet music...or tabs...or stuff for ecco music o.o i think it would be cool...all we need is someone with a good ear for music...and the ecco games from gensis wouldnt be too hard. i for one, would like to help out as much as i can (i could try some guitar tabs)i know it sounds crazy, but im sure it can be done. anyways...thoughts? flames?

Weee! I'm back. =] Took lotsa pictures! (Mostly of the dolphins...&gt;.&gt;) I'll try as soon as I can to get 'em scanned! Urf. We have to get them developed first. x_x But I don't know. They might have to be in black and white. My scanner doesn't scan colours and my dad LOST his digital camera. *beats him* Arg. Btw! Icewall! I love your avatar! Little Washuu owns. XD

Ah damn... my post got deleted... well, what I basiclly said was:You did one of meeeeee?!?! Awwww... thanks so much!!!! ^_______^ I would LOVE to see it! I think your race has a real cool design, and I'm very interested in what my character would look like as one. So come on! Spill the beans, girl!! I want to see!!!Thanks a lot Nori!!!^.^ Very soon, Doomy, very soon! I'm still in the process of the colouring. Heh. Jeez, that takes longer than I thought. ._. Anyways, thanks! ^__^ I really hope you guys will like them

^_@ Well! I'm back from my very short vacation! I had a lot of fun, but I'm very tired. Too bad school starts tomorrow. Anyways, I hung out by the dolphin interaction thing most of the time. Lol. Bought a lot of fish to feed them. I should have asked the guy what the dolphin's names were. There was this one that I particularly liked. =] Heh. It was loads of fun.

okay, well, since i got some feedback...heres my plan.i e-mailed mista heger (maker of TOT music) and i tried to e-mail tim follin...but his e-mail address wont work...? so i asked if he had any old sheet music or music plans or anything...so im waiting for a response *crosses fingers*im hoping some arkon.com users will have a musical ear and want to help out. im sure some of you a gifted with music, and there are a lot of tabbing programs on the net for one thing, just to let you know...and any help at all will be greatly aprriciated! i really want this to get off the ground and not die after 3 minutes o.o;

<br />

<div id='container'>
If you can describe her, I can probably help you. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm. Okie, lemme try to remember details...well...most of the others had like, scratches and scars and things on them, but she didn't. She was pretty lightly coloured...about average size too, compared to the others. Some of them were kinda big and dark. o_o I don't remember if there were any distinct like, marks or anything on the flukes or dorsal fin or whatnot, though. I hope that's descriptive enough. x.x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
thanks oh holier-then-thou. o_o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds like Carona. Could be Cometta too. They're the only two dolphins that are pale grey like that and don't have distinct rake marks.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Spiffy! =D So are there any big differences between Carona and Cometta? Maybe if you could describe the two, I could imagine her in my head and see which one she is. ^_^ Thanks, Shadow, this actually really means a lot to me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
If I recall correctly, Cometta is the smaller of the two.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ah. well let me see...hm...I think it's Carona then. I think I remember seeing another dolphin that was smaller than her. *nod nod* Well cool! Now I know her name. =*]

<br />

<div id='container'>
^_^ Well, I hope you get a reply! In the meantime, I'll try to help.

I have a program, Noteworthy Composer. It's designed to write and play midi music files. Or you can use it the other way around, and take existing midi files and interpret the notes, one staff for each instrument. All I have is the trial program, but I think the registered will print out the music. That would certainetly do the trick.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
wow atreus! could you try it out and see what happens? you could post it here or e-mail it to me as a .txt file

im trying to come up with a day when i can work on a new juke box for the site. theres some awesome midis my moduvator that never got the reconition they deserve. if i had a juke box to play them people could see them. if i get a new juke box up its gonna be different from the old one. more like a popup window that plays music withen it. i thuoght that be better. that and if i made it out of php all i have to do is upload the music and it be apart of the jukebox  :P
</div>

thats pretty good noriko.you know its funny. im toying with the idea of making a fan game about ecco the dolphin. i been toying with the idea of maknig it online but doing an online game is way over my head. but i might just attempt it once i get the main game engine done and a few levels. (a demo released of the game)i been telling people for years i am gonna do this game idea...dammit i think its time to announce it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I can't hold it back any longer. i been wanting to aviod telling you guys what i been doing although most of you know kinda from my last update but i been trying to aviod posting about it until i prove something.I'm getting there but still far away from making a game. but theres a possiblity you might see something out of me sometime soon...im relly pushing myself hard to learn how to program. i am even toying with the idea of maknig my game online.my games gonna be 2d but doing it online is going over my head. even dolphin mentioned it but...i might go for it and risk it.im picturing a new ecco game which im gonna do that allows people to play the game tarting from the first level like any other ecco game. except you have others with you in the online version and you can go abck to old levels and collect secreat items and things that can help you on your quest.i had an idea that you can abcktrack to older levels or use teleport rings to teleport to some of them.if you get far enough in the game you will have access to the time machine hat will work as a teleporter that can take teleport you to other levels or travel you back in time to other worlds. when you go to the time machine you choose a map that shows the world. mapped on the world is your level and you can choose older levels you been to and go abck to collect things you might of forgotten.as you progress through the game and encounter different atlantean time machines you are allowed to travel to any level you already been to before but you wont be able to go to any later levels until you reached it the way your suppose to.basically i picture it like this. everyone starts out at a home bay. because of how many people could be on the net you have a choixe of selecting other home bays. from there you play the game in a team if you want (it will be limited.) and play the game through. say if you reched a far level but are too tired to play. you save your game and when you come back your at home bay again but will have the ability to go back to that level you left off at with a teleport ring for you.but say you have a perso on your team who hasnt reached the high level you have but you want to work with them. they cant go to that high level your at so what you have to do is go to the level they left off at and help them work there way up to were your at.the game will have alot of surprises in it but i cant promise it to be online. the first evrsion of the games gonna be a non online version with a two player mode. if i feel i can do it i'll add in online capabilities.problem though. you wont be able to be ecco in the online version. you have to make a custom character and use it. you wil  probably accompany ecco on his quest. not sure how it will work.in the non online version you can be ecco along with other characters in the game.anyways its an idea for my game i was relly thinking of.i might as well ell you whats up. i havent been doig updates or posting latly because i been so busy trying to elarn this stuff. its gonna take a lnog time because it is hard stuff to comprehend but i can assurer you i will learn it. and eventualy make a fan game....my fan game will be the sequel to ecco the dolphin 2: the tides of time.see project arkon on the main page for more details.

You can print out the scores in the unregistered Noteworthy Composer, actually. It just prints a registration page with each print job. Take any midi on the site and open it up in 'Composer, and you can print the score out.

Again? that's the second time this has happened. ok.In the time of atlantis... K'Shid wasn't even born yet when a vortext evolutionary virus/parasite attacked his mother and infected him while still in the womb. Fearing the consequences of the virus/parasite, the dolphin parents fled for atlantis. The vortex caught up with them when K'shids mother stopped to give birth to him. K'shids first memory is of seeing his parents ripped to shreds by vortex drones. The drones did not harm him, however. Instead they took him to the vortex hive, where he spent his first year, eating sea life filtered in through the vortex machines and learning about the outside world through dolphins condemned to die in the queens jaws. He was given as much freedom as a drone due to his mutated genetics (allowed access to areas having to do with drone work, but not allowed to leave the hive). His mind and body matured rapidly. He managed to escape during the queens feed cycle and fled for atlantis to report all he knew. Despite having been virtually raised by them, he realised the vortex needed to be stopped. When he arrived in atlantis, the atlanteans locked him up, thinking him to be a vortex spy or some kind of weapon. He spent half a year in an atlantean prison cell, kept in solitary. The only possesion he was allowed was a connection to the atlantean glyph library. Then atlantis fell to the vortex. In the chaos, K'shid escaped by luring a guard into his cell and killing him. He fled for the time machine and escaped into the future a few years before ecco. K'shid realized that there was only one being who was totally impartial and not likely to be as xenophobic as the atlanteans. The asterite welcomed him and he stayed with the wise being a year, serving as its guardian and telling it all he knew about the vortex, information which would prove crucial in eccos defeat of the vortex queen. In return the asterite taught him to control his shapeshifting, and the arts of sonar blasting and aura sensing. He parted amiably with the asterite. K'shid fought against the vortex invasion (in tides of time). He served well, destroying scores of vortex drones, although he felt a little uneasy about it. After the vortex invasion he roamed up and down the south american and african coastlines for a year, destroying human sewage plants that dumped waste into the water and performing other acts of earth saving sabotage. He is believed responsible for the sinking of at least 3 whaling factory ships. Currently he is looking for a place to lie low. Someday he wishes to return to the vortex planet, to find out what has become of them and "mop up after ecco". Appearance His often frightening appearance belies a strong sense of ethics and a very intelligent mind. All things come at a price, however. K'Shids price is the ability to bond with other dolphins, or indeed almost anyone. His only true friend is the asterite, and even the ancient being describes him as "Hard to read." Most dolphins find him cold, intense and silent. Little ones of all species show no such fear, however. K'Shid is convinced that the vortex weren't/aren't entirely evil, merely desperate for food. If there are any survivors on the vortex planet he plans to teach them how to fend for themselves, without their machines to provide for them. He has two surnames. In vortex form he is called 1Krrrrzzzzzzdt1 and in human form he is called "Sid". Both are variants on his delphine name.

I see..... *runs away*I think it is cool when you or someone you know is bilingual! In the case of my dad, he was in the army so he knows many languages. He is fluent in Russian, German, Japanese and Korean. It is very funny when we go to a foreign owned store and he actually starts conversations with them!

Where can I see your comic, Doom?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks atolm! Ok the look i'm going for is like a cross between dolphin and vortex. Mostly he's dolphin but vortex stuff crosses into him at points. Black chitin mostly, or whatever the hell the vortex are made of.Or you could draw one of his other forms. Email me Hedgehogey@aol.com when you've got a rough sketch done.

I'm curious... when Trellia meets Ecco for the first time.... she introduces herself to Ecco as in Is she supposed to introduce herself to a "distant relative" with her (if it is) real name? She could have caused a bad thing (she'd "Cease to Exist" 8O ).this I know from 2 things, of which "no. 1" clearly marks my point...1. In one of the Simpsons episodes, Grampa Simpson says " If you ever decide to travel to the past, DONT step on anything... 'cause even the TINIEST change can alter the future in ways you can't imagine".2. Then, in one of the DBZ episodes, when Trunks tell's Goku that he is Bulma's son, Goku freaks out and much later when baby Trunks is born, he (Goku) goes "Hi Trunks". Then he realises and then he goes "YIKES"..... something like that.... My two "give me a fish"I hope I put it right (it's really late as I'm typing this :/ ), and I sincerelly apollogise for (if) going off-topic.
</div>

<div id='container'>
*sets up little cheering squad for Arkon*You can do it Arkon! W00t! Just don't give up, that's all. Like you told me once, just do what everyone else doesn't, and do it. ... or something like that. ^_^

8O Holy cows, Swifty!!! That's amazing!!! You did that in Photoshop?! That's... I... how... I can't.... *dies*How do you paint like that in Photshop? It's simply amazing! Like... the planest in the background are fabulous! Just like I told Neko, you should check out the program Painter. You'd be brilliant with that!!!

damnok, will someone try this for me and send me the results? just run any midi throo it and send it too me. plz and thank you! ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think I see where your going, and I think I have two possibilities.1- Trellia comes from the good future that only exists because she went back and got Ecco. In other words, she goes back in time to create her own future.2- There is enough time in between the two times that Ecco's knowledge of Trellia has little or no effect. Taking into account the technicalities of dolphins evolving into what they are in Trellia's future, several million years are required. The only way Ecco is affected is by gaining knowledge that he will have and descendant in the far distant future.Maybe that works.

<div id='container'>
hmm...could be true. but im sure the asterite took care of all the loose ends :D

No worries Kitnee.    Take your time!Here ya go, At!  Take a look at my new avatar, too - it's got a picture of Kitnee (a frontal view), and you can see her moon mark better on it than on mine; in case you wanna do a frontal shot, take a look at that, and you can see the mark better. ^.^ Also, the purply mark on her fluke is on both flukes, not just the one - it's the Mark of Atlantis (in my story, anyways &gt;//sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/Kitnee2.png

Bah, Painter is a box of evil. Theres very few things that can't be done in photoshop given proper use of layers and brush types.

<div id='container'>
its really sad how people would not want to read a book simply because of hype it received as a movie...especially a series as extraordinary as the Lord of the Rings. i too have started reading the Silmarillion...it relates to the first and second ages of middle Earth, and if you have any interest in Tolkien lore, it is well worth the read. But don't refuse to read a book simply because it is over enjoyed as a movie...it's a book you really shouldn't miss.

Weeee!!! ^_^ *going to be a Marine Biologist as well* ROCK ON! Excellent career choice, if I do say so myself, Ice. XD Anyways, thanks everyone! ^_^ Yes, I know it was quick. Sort of a small end-of-summer vacation-ie thing. I was only gone for like...3 days. But I got to spend all of monday at Sea World. Heh. I'm probably going to be over there a lot, too, once I get a car...(and a driver's license, for that matter -_-)so I can go back to the dolphin interaction area thing. Bweeheeheee! Visit Carona again. =] My mom always teases me, saying that the trainers and stuff are going to know me by name. Lol. Which might not be a bad thing.

^__^ I do! But I can't 'em developed until later this week. x_x I have to use up the last of the film; most of my good 'phin pictures are like, the first seven on that roll. But I don't know if you guys'll be able to see them in colour! *kicks her stupid scanner* Yeargh. x_-

<div id='container'>
Oh, and maybe ya could look off of this, Nori, if you're still gonna do a piccy of me. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aw, black an' white's OK. ^__^  S'OK - my scanner likes to chew up my piccies' color, too. X_x Like this one pic that I scanned today, which I finished a few days ago (it's of Eusine, that dude from Pokémon Crystal) - the colors were all way lighter than the original. I'll have to fix the settings on it later.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XD! I will! Because they took Sailor Moon away from meeee! ;_; And Tenchi, too. *gasp* And I haven't seen much of Cowboy Bebop lately......*weep* Anyways, to Kit: Nah, no reimbursement. Isn't it like, within 90 days? He's had it for kind of a long time. x_x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^_^ *whew* Alright, yea they're gonna be in black and white. x_x But that's okay. Maybe once my dad finally gets around to buying a new one, I'll re-scan 'em. =] I don't know if I have any of any whales, though...oh wait! Yea, maybe like one of this pilot whale that was in one of the dolphin shows. o_o But I think that's it.
</div>

Aw, that sucks mucho, Nori. X_x Ugh...English Sailor Moon...that's on the top of my "My Life's Banes" list. XP

Trellia, Noteworthy is mae for windows only *bastards* that music prog. I had before to make my stuff, Melody, was good, but it doesn't run well on some macs. I have Virtual PC, and so I can run noteworthy. I have Harmony assistant, and that prints out full scores of the midis'. I just recently got a Roland Digital Piano, and I can play a fair few MIDI's on that.Ecco II Title Screen Ecco I City of ForeverEcco I Title ScreenEcco II Trellia's Bay (teaching myself this painfully x.x)However, thats only the right hand pieces.

<br />

<div id='container'>
Bah, I like PaintShopPro. :p
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^.^ Yep, done in MS Paint. Thanks, Doomeh! =] I do like...all my colouring in MS Paint. e.e I need to get PSP or something. But I'm just so laaaaaazy!Ah....I have a copy of PSP. Would you like it? It's, like...huge, though. Like 700 meg. I used to have the zip file but I deleted it 'cause it was around 200 meg. But I'll still upload my copy and you can DL it if ya want. But ya really do need like a fast connection. It took my DSL, with only me using it, around 3 hours for the zip file. O_o; Hurrah for friends who will give you their pirtated copy!!! &gt;:p
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ohmygod.... it's just so... beautiful... I can't look at it! The beauty is burning my eyes!  Ha ha! No really... I can tell it's a dolphin. Very nice Phosis. ^_-
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thank you Phosis. ^_^I'd just like to tell you all about the  new quiz I made! Go take this quiz and find out what CAD character you're most like!!! Cool beans! So... GO TAKE IT!!!Show me your results too. I wanna see! You can just post it here, or I started a topic for it on the CAD message board for you to post it. But I want to see! My results were Stephen, Dawn, Jimmy then Kat. How's aboot you?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The opposite of an owl wearing a teacher. Ha ha hawell good luck then. i guess you got your computer fixed or are going too.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
bleh dolphins just afraid to try new things.the only reason why i havent pushed the idea is i don't see the idea lasting. i mean i'll appoint a clan leader then what?but i got a good idea, as you'll see in my next topic.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Alright folks you heard it. now is your chance to become a leader of this very very select group. As a group leader your job is to mod this forum and bring interesting topics here. I don't want any useless leaders so i may make this a short term thing to give different people a chance. i just need canadates of whos willing to do this. If i get no canadates this won't work.your job though will be to bring the descussion to the people and appoint new people in. you have to go by the rules shadow set in addition your allowed to amend new rules but- you cant break old ones. http://arkonviox.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=567if you ever seen epicenters forum you'll see he runs it with a certain style. thats what im hoping here. we can get someone to run this forum and bring ineresting topics here. I'm counting on someone to do it for me. because im just that type of a  nice guy =D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
This is very exciting. I would be more then happy to attempt this great job. I have wanted to do something for Arkonviox.com besides just writing; to contribute something better. I would be willing to look for interesting topics for Earth Clan members to discuss, and to watch out for useless things as explained in the Earth Clan rules. I would work very hard to create, as you said, a certain style for the forum, and to make Earth Clan interesting. I would be willing to look for files, pictures, music, and any other thing that the members here deserve to view. Of course, I don't want to begin to repeat myself...bottom line is, I want to try. I know I have not been here as long as many other people, but I have been looking for other ways to help here, as I have told Arkon before. So, take me into consideration; I'm sure you won't be dissapointed.

<div id='container'>
welcome back vantid. i hope to see more of you around its been a long time. like to se ehow your holding up.So anyways what day did you start school?

it will support two players in offline mode. in online mode though you can't choose ecco. you have to use a custom character.

Eh. It was simply a suggestion.

<div id='container'>
Though I wish I could my time on the net is never definate, and with all the work I need to do I would neglect my duties as leader, so I guess I sit this one out. :(

What you should do, Arky, is select maybe three people you think are worthy of the position, and then create a poll so that we can all vote on it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey! We're the same, Pho! Interesting. 8O
</div>

see, dolphins save people, a cow will kill you by troping on you if you are it its "ploding path", lay ontop of a sleeping cat if it wants to sleep there,  a cow caused the chicago fire.dolphins save people and try to make love to them. they are smart and do tricks and are fellow meat eatersthats the diff between eating a cow and a dolphin.i loves fish.  I like sushi tuna better (i can chew it) smoked salmon and fishy fish.not boring trout or tilapia.i'm the only one who expands my piscavoir tendices out of "canned tuna"

Welcome back Nori! I was just in San Diego 5 days ago. :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
from spending 5 hours dying and losing races in Perils of the Coral reef, one of those trendy red fish seem to have died on me.It was floating near the water, listless and i could not eat it, when I got close I'd "swim through" it.it was away from all the other trendy red fish (they are neonorange on my TV) are getting eaten by racing dolpins who didn't want to play with me anymore.I cannot eat this fish. I belive it is dead.also if you stand in the way of the dolpins, they'll bump into you.  I though those asses were starting to beat me up, because i lost to many times, or was eluded by red fish (peer pressure is harsh no?) but i was just in the way and got bumped.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hrm...that dead fish is very interesting! 8O Too bad you couldn't take a screenshot of it; that would make a neat addition to the Interesting Things section! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it's like that Schimmel guy...animals in space.how do one make waterwebbing?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was wondering where you'd gotten to, Lizza!! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
dolphins save people and try to make love to them.WHAAAAAT?! O_O;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, but the actual game itself doesn't play music and sound.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
we are one big happy disfunctional fammily.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
True; I've never even heard of Pocket Ecco.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Amen to that. 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That was my thinking...Well, it sounds interesting, but I wouldn't do anything. How many things have I promised that I haven't even been able to start yet?   If it works, it will be awesome, but I just don't picture it working with me in charge. So, may the best one win.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol, very nice. X3And disfunctional is putting it lightly....    lol
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Funny~ I never got the hang of painter.....I like my photoshop better anyway.  :P
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Bitchin'!  Keep us posted Arkie. I'd love to play that game. :3
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The master problem with Earth Clan as I see it is that it has no purpose.  What role does EC play in the site? As far as I can tell Earth Clan type material is just not being generated, and the membership roles of Earth Clan seem to obey no rhyme or reason. If we can't come up with something to do with this 'very very select group', we might as well formally dissolve it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
BTW, just as a random comment, since MP3 players now cost 0.75 bucks in licensing fees, I hope someone with two full brain hemispheres will get around to rerip those songs as .ogg soon ;).OGG is a superior format for high bitrate music anyway.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Me, I sing rather well, and can hit highs with great ease :)
</div>

<div id='container'>
PS kit, cally got me the prog, so dont worry about it :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
BUWHAHAHA you all thought i was crazy (maybe i am) but i did (after much replaying of the song) get it figured out on geeeetar. woof. trellias bay (the main tune)http://www.arkonviox.com/user/trelliasbay/tbayguitar.au (watch out, its 1 MB)okay, i screwed up a bit and the tempos all wrong, but you get the ideasooOOOoo...okies. heres where i need your guys input. is there interest in me making tabs of ecco music? does anyone else play guitar and would want me to do this? or is it something only id probably enjoy?oh and arkon, a crazy idea. what if fanfare included a music section? i dunno. or maybe add a section to the already made music section. either way.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XD! Me and Lizza missed each other at Sea World by 2 days! How weird is that?  8O
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hehe. Yea, didn't you read that thing about the dolphin that was like, trying to bring female swimmers out further from the shore and like...mate with 'em? That was odd. Not like he actually managed to,(er...) but they were worried that somebody might drown or something.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well! As the saying...thing...goes; "Let's all put the fun back in dysfunctional!" And I think we've managed that. For sure.  8)  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
For meh! Stephen, Jimmy, Dawn and then Kat
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
&gt;] How generous of you, Kit! =D That'd be awesome! Unfortunately, I don't have DSL. x_x So it'll prolly take me even longer. lol. But no worries! I'm sure I'll be a-okay.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think that making guitar tabs would kick all ass Trellia.I'm makign MIDI conversions of the MIDI's I have done of it in order to print out piano versions.   http//callyfin.dolphinparadise.net/ATSCD.mid (i can play the right hand part of this, not the bass, yet)http//callyfin.dolphinparadise.net/RTTP.mid (going to learn)I'll make more conversions later ^_^ 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well thats the thing, isnt it? Earth clan seems to be made for the people who contribute much, and who actually give a crap about the forums.I had a couple ideas for what could be done with it...But something definitely does. to destroy it completely would be a waste. I personally would want to make something good out of it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Cally. =] We should sing a duet sometime. (heh. =D) Anyways, sorry I haven't really helped. I said I would and I didn't.  ;__; But it looks like you guys are getting along with the idea very nicely. =D I can't wait to see what turns up.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hm..yes, but it seems that almost everyone is in the Earth Clan.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oh well. do whatever then.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That is an interesting fact... indeed. I have heard of that before as well!And the cow and dolphins thing, it still would not matter. People are going to eat them anyway, regardless of intelligence. Sounds very negative, but you cannot change anyone's mind. Oh yes, i am now content, I got shushi today! yay!! :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, maybe we can do a duet one day ^_^ I can play After the Storm (CD) on the roland, with both hands *dies of shock*  I recorded it and i'll rip it onto my HD tomight off the disk. ^_^ YOu can hear me screw up while loooking for the keys :D

Yep, the funny part is that i never imagined that i would have a use for it either. Well, that changed.

OK! Just make sure you have one of those DL programs like Go!Zilla or GetRight or whatever. I'll get it ready for uploading now.

hehe. Yea, didn't you read that thing about the dolphin that was like, trying to bring female swimmers out further from the shore and like...mate with 'em? That was odd. Not like he actually managed to,(er...) but they were worried that somebody might drown or something.Nuuu, I never read that. O_o;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, try using only CD-Rs, not CD-RWs. CD-Rs are better for when you wanna burn just music, because you can never burn over them ever again; CD-RWs are better for when you wanna make backups of files, 'cause you can just keep adding stuff to them.
</div>

Sounds like a plan, but will the poll be in the forum or on the main page? :?

<div id='container'>
Agreed, I forgot not everyone visits the forum everytime.

<div id='container'>
Actually I favour CD-RW, they can function exacly s normal ones but you can use and reuse them. The only down side is not all Music CD players support them. :(
</div>

<div id='container'>
I can make more screenshots if you wish them, I have the BETA and I can quite easily take the shots, so just say of what and when you want them.

<div id='container'>
Exactly, Trell - not all CD players can play them. In fact, the older ones that weren't made when CD-RWs came out can't. So has been my experience.

Alright i suppose its phosis and whitefin as the canadates.Heres the deal. When you become leaders eithier of you your gonna have to relly work hard on keeping this board alive. also your gonna be put in charge of co working on postnuke sections, which means you need to contribute to this site and come up with ideas for a section to run. I dont mean preexisting sections i mean soemthing related to ecco and new.In addition i may even assign other sections upon you guys. like being in charge of fanstuff. it means everytime i recieve soemthing new for fan fare or soemthing you will be the one to update.i just need to know are the two canadates up for this challenge or not.when you receive updates for Arkonviox.com they have to be put up immediatly...not tomarrow not the next day. doing that expires any chance be being a leader.So let me know now whos a canadate.

hehe. Yea, didn't you read that thing about the dolphin that was like, trying to bring female swimmers out further from the shore and like...mate with 'em? That was odd. Not like he actually managed to,(er...) but they were worried that somebody might drown or something.Point in fact , dolphins are the only other mamls, next to man, who have sex for enjoyment. (ie. they do it cuz they like it not just to procreate)This story is new to me, but I can see it making sense.

and what is even more terribly sad... i still have that email report about that particular dolphin (or at least one of them); Sexually Frustrated Dolphin Sparks AlertJune 4, 2002 9:39 am EST LONDON (Reuters) - Swimmers have been warned to stay away from a sexually frustrated dolphin off an English seaside resort after it tried to lure unwary humans out to sea in a bid to mate with them. The Times newspaper said on Tuesday that the bottlenose dolphin, nicknamed Georges, had arrived off Weymouth, Dorset, about two months ago after following a trawler across the Channel. "This dolphin does get very sexually aggressive. He has already attempted to mate with some divers," U.S. marine mammal expert Ric O'Barry told the paper. "When dolphins get sexually excited, they try to isolate a swimmer, normally female. They do this by circling around the individual and gradually move them away from the beach, boat or crowd of people." O'Barry said the dolphin, which weighs an estimated 400 lbs (180 kg), would get very excited and rough and try to mate with the swimmer, possibly causing them to drown. The dolphin also has a fascination for boat propellers and has been injured several times. But it has resisted attempts to move to less-populated waters, the paper said. Since his arrival at Weymouth, Georges has become a major attraction at the seaside resort with thousands of people taking to the sea in boats to watch him play.... and as for the canned dolphin and minke whale down in japan, i think i shall refrain from commenting much on that... quite upsetting to me, really. all i truly recall is that they like to sneak past international whaling laws by claiming the killings are for research. keeping populations in check and such since the country's major food product is fish. funny how they put their research in cans in supermarket aisles.

Then help me fight back!  I'm extremely pissed that my Tenchi Muyo was taken away, and I liked Sailor Moon, too.So now I am compaining to Cartoon Network.  Who wants to help me!  Just go to www.toonami.com, click 'Watch' at the top, the click 'Help' on the right side.  Clisk the question 'How do I request a show?' and complain!Pleeeeze, I really want to see my favorite animes again, and it doesn't seem like Cartoon Network is listening!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Same here. Did not like the fact that they cut out some of the stuff, I would have loved to see Tom and Old Man Willow.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
The fact being is that i live in the middle of nowhere, a trip to buy fish means taking a long trip. And it seems that I am the only member of the family who likes fish, so that is another reason why I hardly eat it.Ah, thanks for the clipping Neo, that is interesting.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I believe it is in California. I say this cause I know someone who is going to the UC campus there.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ahh, it reminds of that  "save our scouts" campaign that happened awhile ago. Sailor moon was an intersting anime, i finished the whole series long ago. Not an easy task when the series is so long. I thought the battle with Galaxia would never end.I'll give the cartoon network a look and see what I can do.Do you have a DVD player and do you mind reading subtitles? I know of a site that you can buy animes and box sets for very cheat. They are foreign DVD'S and they all have the english subtitles. The down side to this is that there is a small percentage that actually have poor subtittles (i.e grammer spelling).  You can even find the anime that has never been out in the US like Dragon Ball GT.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
O_O What site is this, Atolm? I actually like subtitles better than dubs, so I would love to get a couple subtitle dvds! ^.^ but still, it's nice to see some of my favourite anime (even dubbed) on tv once in a while. = I mean, hey! It's better than nothing! So yes! I will help you, Ice!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well, its hard to find when you think about it. you know, i probably went into that same cove over and over rather than switching to the other oneanyways, i know im stupid, you dont need to rub it in.  :P

<div id='container'>
My dad's going to Riverside for work. I wish I could go with him,then I could phone Nori! If I even knew her number...heh......O_O! Riverside!! Nah ah! You are so joking! XD! Omg, Lizza! This is too weird!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sorry o.o; I cant say that I do. But I did like the subtitled DBZ's, which were more or less banned. I guess Ill sign, just for you, in honour of my own loss.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
x_x Gah. Living in the middle of nowhere. Atolm, I feel your pain. I, too, live out in the boonies.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
My family has a large collection of old books that deals with ancient cultures. I remembered seeing the runes on one section of one of the books long ago and did not think about it until I came to this site. I checked other books, both new and old to see if there were changes. There was none so i decided to go with this one.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I haven't even seen the movie yet. O_O Pathetic, no? And WHAT!? No Tom?! ;_; But he was so cool. Now I'm mad. &gt;O
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^.^ yus, indeedy! I especially love your avatar, Neko. O_O it's so beautiful! *runs away with it* =p Just kidding. Hehe.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yes, i had that problem too. And the electric eel was no walk in the park either. As for thr other one that just stands there, that was kinda fun! Of course it was a bit tedious making the manta ray moves toward the eel.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You're quite welcome =D Yea, I need a new avatar too. *ahem* Still waiting for one from Crest, though. But no worries. You know what they say; patience is a virtue.  8)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Gah. x_x They're coming along okay. I mean, idea-wise I'm good to go! But it's just that I'm so BUSY lately! @_- Starting school...blah. You know the deal. Only in school for THREE DAYS and my stupid English teacher gives me a project to do over the weekend. &gt;&lt; Hopefully I'll have more time in the following weeks.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I tried to make sense of this topic, but i have despaired. So i shall let it be... and watch the confusion continue.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Lol. I don't really mind anymore. *shrug* Btw, I like your sig, Trellius. XD
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yep, the boonies. farms, animals, acres of nothingness. not to mention the smells... blah, the stench of a road killed skunk... :(
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh. Well, I've only smelled that about...twice out here. But still! I know the farms and the acres of nothingness. x_x But I suppose it's not TOO bad. I actually live in a community-type thing, so there are a LOT of houses right here. But basically just bunched together. It's pretty big, but once you leave, you have to drive MILES AND MILES AND MILES just to get to a fricken Grocery Store. :x  It sucks, man.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
awww... *pats Noriko's head* sorry to burst your bubble... :(
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^.^ heh. No worries, Atolm. I suppose it was better for me to find out now as opposed to when I actually watched the movie. O_O Who knows what I would have done? But poor Tom. ._.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
So that means no Goldberry, either?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yes yes.. in my case, i just live in a house that has seven acres. We have neighbors that have their own privat ranch, a nursery for plants and down the street, a bar.. that sums it up. some what.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh. Well. That actually sounds pretty peaceful. O_O No obnoxious little kids leaving candy wrappers on your lawn, playing in your driveway or killing all the plants in your front yard you worked so hard to keep alive in the first place... *shakes a fist* damn them...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
sadly so. but do not despair, i heard in november that another edition is coming out with new scenes. The stuff they had to take out. But i also heard that this edition is also expensive.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Bah! Goldberry was simply awesome as well! ;.;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i enjoy raising animal, and that there is a challange, since i have to protect them from stray dogs and the coyotes. And possums too, they eat our chicks.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
its best not to think about it...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
O.O ...aw poo. I wanna raise animals. =o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
even the barrow downs was taken out. That really sucks.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the entire game was a tedious taco shell with fillings of pain and suffering for me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Its actually quite fun, despite the hard work of taking care of them. We mostly specialise in birds.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yep. all the fantasy was taken out of the fantasy book. it is simply a straightforward adventure now, (albeit still a good one.) and much of the mystique is lost.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ah yes, the obstical that is school. Don't worry, take yer time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^.^ Thanks! I'm doing my best. That's what counts, right? =]
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
exactly! We shall all be patient for you Noriko!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
^__^ I'll get them done as soon as possible! (still might not be very soon, but bah. x_e) Anyways, thanks again! =]
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
No problem, i have the same problem at school myself. Especially in class, they saw some of the character's pics and they went nuts.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol! Like...good nuts or bad nuts? o_o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yes, all this thinking has started to make me deranged, I may have to run away in panic....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
good nuts! They saw a quick sketch I did for Arkon (he asked me to do one of him) and the pic i did for you.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
XD! heh, I know how that is. x_x That's why when I draw in school, I either like...cover it with my hand or I do it my sketchbook where I can close it. =p I kind of don't like being in the spotlight for things like that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yep! and then you get  the people who look at your art and suggest to go with this style or that,or wonder why the heck you draw cartoons. kind annoying.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ugh! No kidding! I've had people do that before. -_- If I wanted their suggestions, I'd ask, you know? They'll say stuff even if they weren't even supposed to be looking at the pic. And half the time their suggestions are either...um...kinda crappy, or they'll be totally opposite of what I was going for. Either that or they're jealous and they say something really mean. o_o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Cool!  I normally like subtitled things, but I've grown very attached to the voices of the dubbed Tenchi... *Sigh*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I drove through riverside today. and yeah, its in southern california.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*nods* I would like to know of this site as well, I am a subbed, not dubbed person - but I do wish they would continue playing Sailor Moon down here - we got really fr through the series, and we where almost up to the Amazonian Quartet (sp?) but then they stopped and it's never been played again, we have never gotten the end of the series with Galaxia, nor the tin scouts x,x Death to Cheez TV for taking off Sailor Moon
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Me too. I wanna know, when will they put Cardcaptors back on air? (here in NZ (no... not cartoon network, I can't afford Satellite Dish ? (CC has been replaced by some cartoon called "Angela Anaconda" 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Here's mine.Kat, Stephen, Dawn, Jimmy
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hmmwell I hear that half the cardcaptor cast is gay (but they are little kids!?) and they took there gay-ness away.fansubs are illegale, because imcompetent people should run the show.the american sailor moon was screwed i hear, and we only got the Amazonis quartet and some movies here.  Not those hermaphridite star people.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
buy canned fish from the internet.I'm sure Goya ships.canned octopuss, mix it with lipton brand alfrado sauce and noodle package.instant sea food.

<div id='container'>
Thanks for taking the quiz guys! Very interesting indeed. It seems Kat is pretty common. I've yet to see someone get Dawn. ^_-Anyways.... EPISODE 005 is a go! I've done it guys! I said I wanted to get five comics done by the end of summer, and I did it. Even with starting over TWICE! Aha! Sure it's the very last day of summer, but I still did it, didn't I? ^_^ Not that I'm very please with this one... it's VERY choopy. Take a look. You'll see. But... a comic none the less.What do you guys think? Get it?

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay folks, here is the site where we get our anime from//orangeb.com/I hope you all enjoy this site, we found some rare stuff here like the Nausicaa movie! yay! This site is good for getting stuff that may never come out here in the U.S or finding box sets at much better prices.  Anyways, I know that there are more sites like this one, so I will keep an eye out for them okay?E-bay is also a good place to find these DVD'S.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
quite possibly because you...are. o_o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
...the Sailor Stars aren't hermaphrodites. o_o;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
indeed. I wouldn't be expecting it soon, unless arkon quits his job and locks himself in dolphin's closet with only a computer in front of him for the next year. -_-;but, it does sound awesome, and its something that I've been wanting to see for quite some time!

Crest uses Flash to do those avatars, right?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You realize right that I'm still going to moderate EC even if someone else manages it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That would be impratical, since I don't have a closet. I guess I could lock him in a box. I doubt the game would get done any faster however.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ya..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I made a new avatar...no foolin this time. it took me 20 minutes. it was hard. I am bad at art. the end.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Another glitch that came to mind is in the blades of motion level with those sharks. The damn things would actually freeze and not move at all and when they tried to attack me I would not get hurt at all, no matter what direction they hit me.Also the last glyph in Process that never ends never responded to me.Anybody had these problems as well?
</div>
<br />

Well, I gave it a shot. I did a color pic of Atolm for those who are interested. I don't have much experience with photoshop so it is not that great. But i gave it a try. The only thing that can not be seen is the spines on her back which is white in color.http://arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album18&amp;id=Atolm_2_color&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_photo.php*grins at Alastor* what a cute puppy!!

._. You guys have got to be kidding me. damn them, I say. &gt;.&gt; But going back to the subject, wanna know a really good book to read? XD I dunno if I already suggested this, but Bram Stoker's "Dracula". It's addictive, I swear.

I wouldnt know anything about that stuff. I want to get into anime; I really do. I just dont know where to start.

choose wherever from you want... like:Ranma, Slayers, DBZ, CardCaptors, Digimon, Pokémon, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Tenchi Muyo, Sailor Moon..... yadda yadda yadda......I first started by watching Robotech then Sailor Moon, DBZ, Pokémon, Digimon, NGE, CardCaptors....

Ooh, nifty, At! ^_^ I like it! Yeah, I remember getting bugged about art, too. We had to do this comic strip thing for Spanish, and my teacher just about died when she saw it; she thought it was the best thing on Earth. How embarrassing. &gt;&gt;_&lt;&lt;

Interesting! I never thought about it. Although my sister came up with the idea that maybe what they found in Roswell was a capsule full of humans, and they didn't want people to know, so they covered it up.

Escalflowne is simply a damn good anime. I got the whole series uncut subtitled fo 40 from one of my friends. We just got the Neon Genesis dvd box set awhile ago. As for the sailor stars, they are actually women who can turn themselves into men and are very popular idol singers in the series. A bit strange, but you can only expect that of anime. Probably the last great anime I saw was Jin-roh. Anybody seen this?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Sounds yummy, I think I'll look for some when I go into town next time.

I found a couple of annoying assed glitches in the Mans Nightmare Levels, in 'Blades in motion' i got trapped behind a wall and had to swim with the current till the exit was in sight, easier said than done as the screen was al black except for Ecco and a few orange wall plates -_-In 'Process that never ends' i was forced with a very very annoying glitch where the mover kid got stuck in a wall, and even when i sonarred the little blighter to get him to swim towards me he'd just float backwards back into the wall beside the skip where the rocks from the rock container are poured

Ecco is being released as part of the 'sega smash pack' for GBA, release date 17th september in the US. it is a direct port of the Megadrive (or genesis, whatever) original,and comes with Golden axe and Sonic Spinball all on the same cart  I dont know the UK release, but what does it matter, GBA carts work on any GBA, so just import it ;)

For its sci-fi (or would it, in this case, be fantasy?) value, I'd prefer the theory that there once was a human supercivilization that, for some reason, disappeared, fell, and left behind only a complete lack of civilization (from which the ancient cultures would then arise). It gives the opportunity to explore ruins and maybe some immortal or pseudo-immortal beings to have a chat with :).About humans coming from the future... you expect that when you get around to figuring out how to create matter with a negative pressure (IIRC nobody really knows if this is possible - I'm not quite sure about this, however)  and applying that to a spare wormhole whose one end is in flat space and the other orbiting a black hole. See How to Build a Time Machine (Scientific American) for a good, easily understandable primer on the stance of modern science towards time travel.(of course, since the validity of the theory of relativity is at stake - well, actually, it's already proven to not be a perfectly accurate model of how the universe works, only a pretty good approximation on large scales - and something called the dynamic model is looking to (possibly) replace it, this article might well be obsolete in a few decades - or years.)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
well, the actual release date has been bumped back to sep. 25. but thats okay. I need to get a gamecube first anyways. Thats MY top priority.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
After reading that very same article, I begin to question time travel to even be possible. Look in the section, Censored. it talks about parodoxes of time travel. If you went back in time to kill your own mother, you would never be born. but at the same time, if you were never born, how would you have gone back in time to kill your mother? see? it is a loop. and it makes no sense.
</div>

<div id='container'>
That is just... crazy! I mean... wow. Like uh... how much did these people really put into these games? Maybe we should try talking to Ed again, bring this up with him? He might have something to say about it. But then, he might not ._.   But... I can't believe these things actually mean something! And... that they're so on the ball! (is bedazzled)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Okay! Well. I've decided to get my ass working on another Ecco story. Chronicles of the Keeper is fun, but I'm gonna try something a little more technical. I think I've talked about this before (like in May or something) but I'm taking it seriously now.I'm gonna write a story about Atlantis, and what was going on there just before/when/after the Vortex came to attack it and so on. When I read that e-mail to Ed talking about what Ecco 3 would have involved and saw that they were going to use a character named Cassandra, who made the Glyphs for Ecco, I decided I'd use her, too. So this story will also involve how the Glyphs/Teleport Rings were made for Ecco.Here's a little thing I need help with, though, concerning the Time Machine. My issue:The thing could only be used to travel BACKWARDS in time. One of the quotes from the first game goes'We are losing a war with the planet vortexAtlantis is in ruins after a beam struck from spacewe have escaped into the past with our technology'So what... did they make the Time Machine on a spur of the moment, 'we have to escape!' decision, because the fact that it can only be used to go backwards sort of suggests that to me?You'd think that maybe making a thing like a time machine would take a bit more time than maybe a week or so, right? The way I have it in my head right now is that *construction on the machine started a few years before the story will start*, and they have to finish it to use it to escape the Vortex (which of course puts a bit of a crunch on the people/dolphins involved in its construction).So um... if they didn't make it just to escape, why do you think they were making it at all? 'Cause they were curious?And another thing... how the hell does the sucker work, anyway? We know Ecco's sonar makes it work, so it works on sound? I wanna try something technical and the technicalities are... making me dizzy... @_@
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well...It would have taken more then a few week for sure. I think they probably made it in anticipation of Ecco. They knew he was going to come, and that he would have to use it; which is why it is programmed for him. It seemed to work on echolocation. Using sound waves to bounce back violently, faster and faster, until a temporal vortex was ripped, and the user was sent back into time. it might be hard to do complete technical statistics, but those are a couple of pointers..
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
They've somehow mathematically proven that those paradoxes are possible if it worked the other way around. They used a pool table as an example, with the pockets being wormholes. A ball is hit into one pocket, comes out another (in the past) and hits its original self so that it will fall into the first pocket again. I don't know why this is possible, or even how you'd prove it mathematically, but someone did.As for the UFOs, any change in the past would have to be very carefully thought through. Take, as one example, the holocaust. A horrible tagedy to those who were affected by it, but as a result many, say, humanitarian projects came about. The ending of apartide, I believe, is an example of this, or whenever people say something along the lines of 'preventing another holocaust.' Also, advances were made in the understanding of the human body because of experiments that normally wouldn't have happened. Or take the movie Frequency into account. What is discribed there is saving one life in the past would cause several new things to happen. Even the worst thing in history has a benefit, and this concept is thought about by many science fiction writers.However, there is another possibility that is also written about by a few authors. It has been suggested that maybe people from the future could go back in time and observe historical events, without having to interact with the time period. Of course, you still have to be careful there. The very existance of another person could alter something not thought about.Say you have a room where, I don't know, a world unity conference is being held. That'd be something future peoples may want to see. So you have people go back in time to be in this room. Over the course of history, how many people would be in the single point at one time? And how many people can the room's air support? Far flung, but if you think about it... Ok, so this idea's not so important, but I haven't given it too much thought.*Gets lost*

Nice. I'll make sure to patch it into the rest of the tutorial tonight when I do updates and such.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
my goal is to abosrb as much knowledge as i can and do some sort of small demonstration.The reason i havent even started is i havent had enough time to do any coding but i been donig ALOT of reading. so far 500 pages out of this dictionary sized Windows 32 programming book. i'm just trying to get the idea of how to do it. thats all im learning. doing it thuogh is something i cant do without practice which is soemthnig i havent been getting enough time to do...yeti think im getting some alright pratice on writing my small postnuke module.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Angelos i havent seen you in a long time. I was talknig about you to someone becaus ei was working on a profile. remmeber how you did art for my art contest i still have it up. i was doing some art section converstion work and somoen brought up your name and we started talking about the LH clan. heh good to know your still alive...please dont ask me why i constantly been postponing the art contest. -_-
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ah so you do want to become a leader whitefin. took you long enough to replie. thats not a good sign but im gonna have a poll and decide from there.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heres the deal.As leader of Earth Clan your job will be the following.1. to moderate and bring in a flow to Earth Clan while following the current rules shadow set for the board.2. You will be assigned to existing fanbased sections like fanfare fan fiction and fan poetry in which youwill have the responcibilities to update.3. You will be in charge of making new sections to this site, with the help of earth clan memebers who'd be willing to contribute.Rule 3 needs some explaining so let me talk about it a bit. Basically your job will be to work on new sections by checking out topics rom through out this site on peopels suggestions for sections. you will be like a news paper company in charge of exploring new ideas and putting them all together with the co-operation of earth clan memebrs who are willing to help.You also need to do some web exploring to see what more do you think this site needs? check out other sites and see if they have a feature we dont have? you have to know html and how to make jpegs.I also want someone who is serious about this job. I had so many fuck up moderators of the past who didnt do shit and im not fucking around this time. if i dont see your making any progress the job gets passed to the second most voted memeber.if theres anyone in this group who still wants to become a leader now is your time to come forward...anyone who wants to abck out...now is your time to back out. this job requires alot of work...its not childs play.Also anyone whos dare thinking of becomnig a leader most tell me why they want to become a leader and if they are willing to put there all into there job. This may be a vote but i may override it going with the best apllicant. sorry but i want people who are serious....not people who just want to look cool for there lame friends. This is not an easy job eithier and you have to be creative in thinknig for yourself and not bugging me.As i said you will be working on new sections for this site. if you cant come up with an idea and work with it without sking me "what to do" "what to do" then i'll respond by saying. "maybe this job isnt for you..."So...are you game?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
whoa shit thats fucking awesome vantid.by the way i noticed i been getting alot of links to my site from a forum where someone brought up your tutorial as a topic. the tutorials been down for a while kinda well the images werent link correctly...heh dolphins got it though o.o;;;
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
eh...co..nevermind.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
eao i wouldnt joke about that. i heard stories about how they were a race of humaniod creatures who genetically altered themselves so bad in order to survive on there ruined planet that they been exparamenting with us (humans) which possibly is there closest relatives in order to fix themselves from turning into a non psysical state. from what i heard they are almost near metapsyical beings meaning they have altered themselevs to a point were they wont be able to exist in our psysical world. much like a spirit.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oh eyah one more issue..time travel.I belive we live in a universe that works in parralel with others. so to explain changes in time traveling into the past and alterig it brings you into a parrallel world where the change has effect.so say i went back in time and killed my mom. if i returned i would still exist cause nothnig can change that. but my mom wouldnt shed be dead. on the other hand in an oppisite universe shes still alive in a universe where i didnt kill her.i dont think theres one time line. i also have a strange belife in reincarnation. i heard the possiblity that when you die you can come back as soemthing else in possibly another time! you got to remember the way time exists is very strange much like the universe. it can all be bent and twisted but never looses shape, and can cause someone to fall into one of its holes with the other end being another demension of the universe - a universe in parrellel.heh if you ever had chemistry class heres an interesting aspect on things. matter cannot be created nor destroyed. so when i die what made me up will still exist and possibly end up apart of someone else. guess thats why im not so afraid of death...imortality was what i was givin log before man existed...as for the universe it never began nor never ended. its in a loop hole. even thos ewho belive in god might argue with this think about it? if matter can constantly be broken up into smaller entities then so can god. meaning soemthing had to exist before god and soemthing else existed before it.but...i dont belive in god for the purpose that the universe is based on natural laws.

and what is even more terribly sad... i still have that email report about that particular dolphin (or at least one of them); Sexually Frustrated Dolphin Sparks AlertJune 4, 2002 9:39 am EST LONDON (Reuters) - Swimmers have been warned to stay away from a sexually frustrated dolphin off an English seaside resort after it tried to lure unwary humans out to sea in a bid to mate with them. The Times newspaper said on Tuesday that the bottlenose dolphin, nicknamed Georges, had arrived off Weymouth, Dorset, about two months ago after following a trawler across the Channel. "This dolphin does get very sexually aggressive. He has already attempted to mate with some divers," U.S. marine mammal expert Ric O'Barry told the paper. "When dolphins get sexually excited, they try to isolate a swimmer, normally female. They do this by circling around the individual and gradually move them away from the beach, boat or crowd of people." O'Barry said the dolphin, which weighs an estimated 400 lbs (180 kg), would get very excited and rough and try to mate with the swimmer, possibly causing them to drown. The dolphin also has a fascination for boat propellers and has been injured several times. But it has resisted attempts to move to less-populated waters, the paper said. Since his arrival at Weymouth, Georges has become a major attraction at the seaside resort with thousands of people taking to the sea in boats to watch him play.... and as for the canned dolphin and minke whale down in japan, i think i shall refrain from commenting much on that... quite upsetting to me, really. all i truly recall is that they like to sneak past international whaling laws by claiming the killings are for research. keeping populations in check and such since the country's major food product is fish. funny how they put their research in cans in supermarket aisles.What if a sea world trainer jumped into a pool with a dolphin to do a show infront of hundreds of people,and it started...um...ya know...

All right. Why do I want to be leader? I have come to Arkonviox.com for the past almost year, though I became a member only about 6 months ago. (maybe less. But not by much.) I have probably spent an over excessive amount at this site. i have read the interesting things on a weekly basis, as well as the other sections. My obsession with dolphins goes far deeper then Ecco, but this is my favorite place to be. (considering when I open internet explorer, this site pops up o.o; ) and I just thought...if I am gonna hang around in the forum, on the page, and in the chat so much, I should at least have a purpose; something I contribute to this site besides a few rarely read stories. I don't know a lot of technical stuff. I am a C+ writer, a D- Html'er. But I am willing to learn. I want to look for new ways to keep the ecco community fresh. And even though I don't know the technical stuff now, I have ambition. And that's all any great leader needs to begin. The rest comes with time.

Well, I've got Doomtrain to thank for the basis for it, actually (for coming up with the 'they destroy Atlantis because they know it'll help Ecco, and for saying that the Vortex should time travel). In a sense it's a joint effort on our thinking. But thanks for saying so, Phosis, I appreciate it :3

I can't believe it...I just learnt that Algonquin (a little orca of Marineland Ontario) is dead.No, I can't believe it...He was so cute...And so young (2 years and a half) !It's horrible !

Heh... Irwin... Doubt he'd care much for Icelandic weather. Maybe we need a new place to post all this cetacean stuff? Seems to fit an Ecco site... We'd need some good news to balance out what we've got though.

That could be a very good idea Art. a new section, related to sealife in general. a kind of save the whales thing. If i make leader of earth clan, that will be the firast thing i do; but i will need help from all of you with it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
So! Lookin' pretty good so far, Phosis!I know this doesn't really related to the story but I have to say it now 'Time flows like a tide. The universe has seen planets, systems, and galaxies, fall into nothingness. And in all the dead of the universe, there was a planet called Earth. On this planet, life flourished, died, and was born again, with the flow of time.'**Yeah, like Al said, nice intro. Here's my suggestion'The dolphin quickly became a friendly race to the humans. They could not understand each other through language, so they devised new ways of speaking, using song, and technology. It was at this moment, that dolphins and humans saw their differences.'**Maybe... "The dolphin was soon considered a friend to the human race. Though the two species could not understand each other's languages, they devised new ways of speaking through song and technology.'I like the last line, though you should remove the comma between 'moment' and 'that'.'Humans were greedy. They had a thirst for power, and could quickly be corrupted. Dolphins were good, and desired nothing but food, air, and the sea, which they lived and prospered. Humans were not satisfied so easily. Material wealth was a human requirement, and they felt lost without it.'**This is a good passage! One small thing I'd write the next sentence something like this3Maybe put something like "The two planets were drawn into a great war'.  And my suggestion for the next sentence "The Atlanteans, although with access to much technology and knowledge, were not powerful enough to defend themselves against the race from the other planet. The species they went against were fully evolved... and Humans were not."'Deep within the gates of Atlantis, the humans feared doom. They devised a plan. It was not a miracle plan, and it was not enough to save them as a civilization. But it would work. And when the time was right, Atlantis would have it&amp;#8217;s vengeance, and the remaining denizens of Earth would be spared.'**"They devised a plan that, though not enough to save their civilization, would work as well as they could make it." Or something like that. The 'it's' in the 'it's vengeance' should be 'its'. No apostrophe. I'd lose the 'and' in 'And when the time was right..." Just capitalize the 'w' in 'when'.'In a great council of human kind, a meeting was staged. Words were spoken their that would determine mankind&amp;#8217;s fate. A plan was made, and it was brought through. '**Erm... you might want to consider losing this paragraph altogether. You've already told us that the Atlanteans created a plan, and this sort of seems like you're just restating the fact.'Several days later, man said it&amp;#8217;s final goodbye&amp;#8217;s to their civilization, and using a great machine, fled into the darkness. A beam of light ripped through the sky, and down to the city, and it was torn. The Earth around it shook, and crumbled, and spewed fire from it&amp;#8217;s depths. And for centuries, it remained still. '**Again, the 'it's' doesn't need the apostrophe in it. Neither does 'goodbye's'. The way you have 'a beam of light ripped...' and so on... um... it sort of sounds like the Atlanteans destroyed their own city, because you say they used their machine and all of a sudden Atlantis was being destroyed. You might want to clarify that it was the Vortex that destroyed Atlantis, not the Time Machine o

By no means! Thank you very much Delphi. Some people take constructive criticism as bad criticism; I find it helps. You helped me in a big way. And a very in depth way at that! I do have lot's of mistakes, that I simply would not have seen if not for you and Al's help. I am taking a course in creative writing at school, and high end english as well.

What school you go to? Only two high schools in alberta HAVE that course....I just got very lucky. Lord bless Beaverbrook...oh yea. and to clear mah name a bit...the story was paragraphed before i sent it to ark. but something with the fanfare prevented it from stayin that way...otheriwse, Sorry about that factor. maybe it will work in the future, i hope.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Aliens? The truth is out there, man, I'm a Mulder.Thanks there, Phosis. You actually put it in terms that make some sense. I didn't actually want to get into the nitty gritty technical junk about the time machine (I'll leave things like that to Shadow), either. What you have there, about the way the sound works with the machine, well... yeah! I can see that. I never really thought about it before.I was actually talking to Doomtrain and she came up with a cool idea. I thank her profusely, as well ;)See, Doomtrain there asked me why exactly the Vortex destroyed Atlantis (I had to get her into an Ecco discussion one day, I guess o_o). I was like "Well... maybe they were in the way?" I know the Vortex were warring with the Atlanteans. So anyways, Doomtrain says "Well, maybe they blew the city up because they knew Atlantis would wind up helping Ecco?" And I thought... 'Yeah... why not?' I can't remember if the game ever gets that technical, so I thought "I have an artistic license with fanfic, so..." and this is what I have as my backstory. Maybe someone could tell me how it sounds:I have the Atlanteans already building the Time Machine anyways, even without knowing about Ecco. They learned of Ecco's coming through the Asterite. I mean, it had to be around back then, right? So, it tells them that one day this... hero dolphin or something... will need to use the Time Machine they're building. Okay, fair, a little whacked out, maybe, but... we have to listen to the all mighty Asterite. So they continue working on this machine. For my purposes in this story, I'm going to say that the Vortex had time travel capability even before the whole run in with Atlantis. They were diddling around with it, learning how to use it to help them get ahead in the world, and they stumble across the 'Good Future' (IE - with Trellia and the flying dolphins). The Queen is a little miffed, of course, learning the story of her own defeat. She's beaten by some stupid little insignificant fish (sorry, Ecco!)! She knows she can't exist in this time, and so the Vortex leave the Good Future and travel back to the present. And presently, the Vortex are starving. So, the Queen says 'Hell, let's go to Earth, it looks really... stocked up with food. We'll have a snack, and then we're gonna blow Atlantis up.' Because, ultimately, Atlantis is the reason she's defeated in the first place, right? (Ecco travels back in time to get the globe to get the powers that kill her... well, in the first game, anyway)So. Down to Earth they go. The Asterite isn't aware of this 'tweak in time', the Vortex finding out about Trellia's future. That is something it never remembers happening before. In this story, I'm going to describe time as a chain. It's the same all ways around, and it continually loops. Unless something happens to break a link in the chain, and therefore all the links in the chain are affected by that one broken (changed) link. I don't know if I'll make you go cross eyed with this, but I'm saying that the Asterite telling the Atlanteans about Ecco, and their making the Time Machine/Glyphs/Teleport Rings has happened millions upon millions of times before (time loops, y'see? The chain thing?).Because it must ALWAYS tell the Atlanteans about Ecco and how to lead him to Atlantis, the Asterite remembers EVERY SINGLE TIME it has told the Atlanteans to finish the machine and to make the Glyphs/Teleport Rings. However. This one particular time, the Vortex do something different in the past (discover the Good Future), and tweak the future. The Asterite has no recollection of the Vortex ever having found the Good Future before, because in all those other millions upon millions of times this situation has come up, never before has the Vortex had knowledge of the Good Future. Therefore, the Asterite can't warn the Atlanteans about the imminent destructon of their city, because it doesn't know it'll happen.So basically, the Vortex blow Atlantis up because they want the future changed. Queenie doesn't want to be defeated. Of course, we all know she IS defeated, but... that's kind of a different story. The Atlanteans know about Ecco because the Asterite told them about him.Um... I hope I didn't lose anyone there. I have issues trying to explain what I mean, I only hope that by the time I'm ready to write that in the story I'll really know how to do it. I'm also aware that I might be bending the 'Ecco Universe' rules a bit, but I say, that's what a fanfic is for, right?So... if you get what I mean... does it sound... decent?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
o.o; decent? DECENT? thats (if you will pardon swearing on this board, cause i know you will, arkon) Fucking excellent. I couldnt think like that. if i did, it would take my brain a lot of effort. and i would probably get a headache. what you have there is very very cool, and i am excited to see it written into a story.

my poem.         The Wanderer(my thought on how Ecco the Dolphin felt)So spoke the wanderer, mindful of hardships and of cruel slaughters.       Each dawn I rise alone, mired in ancient sorrows. Wretched and deprived of my Native Land, I have had my mind bound with fetter. For many years I lay hidden in the concealment of the Earth,buried deep in sand. From there, I went,abject and winter-greiving, over the surface of the waves. I sought the prison of my noble kinsmen. Sorrow is a cruel companion to one that can afford few friends,and the path to exile attends this mournful spirit.        And so this world, every day is crumbling and falling. The rulers lie dead deprived of revelry. Bands of warriors lie fallen proud by the wall. War destroyed some,carried them away; a sorrowful man hid one deep within a grave. Thus the Creator of Life laid waste this dwelling place, until the old works of dolphins stood vacant, without the noise of thier inhabitants.      So spoke the wanderer, set apart in secret meditations.       The kingdom of the ocean is full of miseries, and the decree of the fates shall change the course of the heavens!

http//www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/09/03/norway.whale/index.html ?Thanks Ari. I was using this article here//www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=392737Lizza Your statement about Iceland is hearsay. Nils' concern as part of the norwegian Institute for Marine Research is related to the norway's major salmon breeding industry. Hes also concerned that Ocean Futures is not taking proper steps in managing their tame whale. This isn't a new concept; OF has been under fire from the zoological community for years about their mishandling.That said, even though this is the OT forum, I'm closing this topic on the basis of being groundless.

WEEE! WELCOME BACK, STEN! ^.^ Sorry I didn't answer sooner. I've been very busy wiff stuff. Have you guys missed me?  =] Of course you did. Juuust kidding. Anyways, WELCOME BACK!!! *huggles like mad*

...that is absolutely terrible! So young, too...things like these should not happen.

Heh. Only two piercings for me as well, Atolm. =] And how cool is that! My hair sounds like it's about the same length as yours. =p Long hair rocks. *high five* j/k. I might cut mine sometime in the future, though. Like. Maybe when I get to college.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
...Most likely.  wink:

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ohhhhh animals! What animals did you see?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That is a terrible thing to hear. I have never liked the idea  of animals being taken from their environments. I can understand captive born, but this is too much.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the problem is when you have long hair like that you only have one chance to make it look good. One bad cut can screw you up for a good while.I am looking for a photo to send,... but i cant find any...lemme look around somemore.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Very good Dread. And very deep.Have you done other poetry?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I shaved my head. I just didnt want to style hair anymore. im lazy.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yeah right now im working on a simple programming project that will bide me some time. i'm building a content manager that will handle fanfare, a new and improved reviews section and normal content. as well as fan ficts and poetry. it sounds complex but relly it isnt. its childs play once i figure out how the database works. the database is probably my ultimate weapon right now and to think i had it all along. i'm finally using the one tool that can save me alot of tim and effort. and yes i do need some assitance. Dolphin is a very busy person himself he's more of an adviser and i wouldnt want him to do normal dirty work. There are alot of people around here who'd like spotlight in the fame and thats why i choose Phosis as the new leader. Now that your the earth clan leader i will give you special access to the site you didn't have before you wont have fullaccess like dolphin and i but you will be pleased with the results. the only thing i ask in return is you help me out. good luck.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
heh you have a good list of games there.Castlevania:symphony of the night  yeah that had awesome musicand the Ecco songs of time cd.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i used to be catholic but my beliefs are more deeper then i can relly explain. i just get sick of people thinknig there right i belive religion blocks people from having an open mind. covnersion is as evil as assimilation.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hey dreadlord i got your poem. i will have it up the reaosn its taking so long was i got wrapped up in a project and also i thought id give vantids art section a chance to shine in the light. i'll have it up tomarrow night if not sooner. meaning i'll have it up.I didn't mean to delay man. im just lacking sleep from a project i was working on and almost failed me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, castlevania music was awesome. From that list I can see Chrono Trigger OST too, that was a great work, just like in the sequel, chrono cross.
</div>
<br />

i've never actually seen this "dead fish" glitch in DoF, but i am very familiar with the sharks that suddenly freeze in "blades in motion." usually when i attack them they often suddenly slow down their swimming and not move at all, completely freeze, or even will end up rammed outside of the room altogether.i much more prefer the level escape glitches i found at CoH, but they are more fun to perform on the DC version than on ps2. those sharks must be terribly programmed for the ones in part two of "anguish of dearth" (after "entrapment") that had spotted you will actually escape the level as well just to hunt you down.too bad mostly all of the dolphin's nightmare stages are very glitchy, almost seem rather rushed in their creation. you cannot tailwalk in the pools of "hanging waters" (after defeating an exalted dolphin boss), and when you splash in the water the bubbles continue to rise well above the water's surface...

Yesterday, I bought another book, by the same author David Clement-Davies (another animal book called "Fire Bringer"). Still have a long way to go, as that book is also 500+ pages long 8O  (currently I'm on page 32).This one is about a small herd of Deer (or "HERLA", as they're called).

I know a other bug in Ecco DotF:In the level "Process that never ends", when you're in the central tunnel, enter in the place with surface, and do a "tailwalk". When Ecco opens his mouth, you'll see a strange thread between the 2 parts of his mouth, like a chewing gum !

To Cally: Do your private messages work ? I sent you several messages, and you never answered.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
to late cally. i already made my decision. i can't have someone who's so busy. you know you can't do this job callyfin. if you ran soemthing like fanfare i wouldnt be too happy if i had to wait for you to update it then go and do it myself. i seriously need help running this site. i need someone who can do it now right on the spot. Phosis is on alot plus in the chat when i need to speak to him he's got the job.
</div>

I believe that that too. I am never fond of the missonaries who travel all over the globe just to "save" a few people. I'm most likely the black sheep of my religion, and that does not bug me at all.

Thanks! Songs of time was a christmas present as well as the Chrono Trigger soundtrack. The one that was the most pain to get was the Panzer Dragoon Zwei soundtrack. I had two choices on e bay. One bid going for about forty another for a buy it now $99! I won the bid for 45.00.Songs of time is a special track to me for many reasons. one beinng that since my sega cd system broke, i could not listen to the wonderful music. (then i learned that you can just put the cd in a cd player and then play the it).

Well, It was decided. I am a moderator here now too. There is gonna be a few changes in Earth clan; It is going to be made into something good. As it stands right now, Earth clan is dead. I hope to change that. I need some more time to think, and work on things, so right now, this is the new section place. Taking into account dolphins rules, this place is going to be used (as just one of its uses) To gather ideas for new sections, improvements, and the like. Also, Earth clan members, as usual will be getting more then non-members. Entrance into earth clan from now on rely on contributions to the site; if you haven't contributed anything, I see no reason for you to join. Of course, since all of you here (I am assuming) Have contributed to Arkonviox.com, you are all fine. Anyways, I know everyone on this site loves cally...and many of you may be a little sour that it isn't her posting this message. But If you follow Shadows rules, and use Earth Clan for what it is meant to be used as, I know I won't interfere; and then we should all get along just fine.-Pho

o.o I'm Christian. But I'm not one of those who run up to people and beat them to death with a bible whilst screaming "YOU NEED JESUS!!!" -_- As a matter of fact, I've had that happen to me before. I don't remember what I did. o_o Anyways, my situation is almost totally the same as Atolm's. All of my friends are different religions. As a matter of fact, my best friend is Wiccan. And it doesn't bother me at all. Just because someone believes something different doesn't make them any less human. Most of my friends are Mormon, then we have "Matt &amp; Co." (lmao, inside joke XD), an atheist, along with a buddhist and some catholics. And I love 'em all to death. I think the thing about Christianity is that the media focuses so much on the people who only call themselves "Christians." They never seem to show those who are honest and good and whatever else. What I mean is, honest-to-goodness Christians do not go out and bomb abortion clinics. = Sorry if I'm rambling, I just felt like stating my opinion on this particular subject. Hope you won't have a prob with me, Ark. Things have been good so far, haven't they?  :D  Anyways, that's all I gotta say 'bout that.

well, first things first. We need a new section. I have discussed this with Arkonviox. As clan members, it is your job to help think up new ideas and steer commitee as stated by Dolphin. So, first off, you people have made many suggestions for new sections; what else would you like to see at Arkonviox.com? I have a couple of ideas, but I would really love to hear everyone elses opinions. So please, post em' up! Maybe they will be turned into a reality. Also, if anyone has done any websearching, or searching in their own homes, and has found any cool info that is ecco related, (dates for the new DOTF 2, and such like that) Then post that here as well. Thanks a lot guys.

I noticed that "chewing gum" bug also. After recieving the thing that lets you communicate with machines (dammit I forgot what it was called) to the moment you take it off, there is a thin strand between eccos mouth. Most visible whilst tailwalking and chirping :D Other major glitches included the "getting stuck in annoying scenery syndrome" where the frame rate dropped to about 2 fps and most of the time you just had to wait until you drowned.The most difficult level for me on DOF was hanging waters. It took me around 5 stright playing hours to complete!The most confusing and annoying level was, I think it was called blades in motion or something like that, where you had to raise the water level via using different switches. The glyph at the end just confused me and caused insanity!

Ever tried the chronicles of narnia? It is usually toward the younger audience, but it is something that adults still read to this day. The hitchhiker's trilogy is very funny if you want to try that. anybody ever read a book called Archangel? It was written by Sharon Shinn. That one i enjoyed too.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
grrrr... the only thing that is stopping me from playing PSO is the fact that i don't have that damn cd to go online. I bought my dreamcast used and didn't get one with it. So now begins my search for that CD.   grrr....

<div id='container'>
You need the songs featured in Jet Set Radio! (Jet Grind Radio I think in the US)I know you can get a couple of the songs by guitar vader (Magical Girl and Super Brother...which actually REALLY sounds like super flugger when you listen to it! D (From the song Super Brothers) who are you? What's your name? SUPER BROTHER(FLUGGER)!Also I liked the music in Sonic Adventure 2 for no reason. And headhunter. And Unreal Tournament. But if you have modplug then you can just play the songs from UT by looking in your music folder in the games directory. Yorch!

<div id='container'>
what about a section that is dedicated to dolphin species altogether? It could go with the dolphin fact section but we could put info on the many dolphin species that exist. It seems that everyone knows about the bottlenose dolphin, also the common, but what about the hourglass, hectors and the lesser knowns? I realise that this may be somewhat of a big section, but I thought it would be a good idea. Maybe we could include all members of the cetecean family, even they have lesser knowns, I recall talking about a strap tooth whale...any ways just an idea.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, you caught that little thing I said in the OT forum. A cetacean discussion forum. That idea was mostly based on the fact that some people around here have a deep interest in the subject. Of course, problems are cetaceans don't often make it into the current events and therefore the forum would usually be as dead or off topic as EC used to be. If there is a genuine interest and possibility it would work... that's different.As for Atolm's idea, maybe it could be simplified? Limit it to only those species that appear in the game. The next level up could be those species assumed by the various personas of Arkonviox.com. On an even more complex level, it could touch on the various species of the fanficts. Not to discredit Atolm's original idea, Ecco is a cetacean, but to touch on all the species would be too much, even if each one is talked of breifly, that's what? 86 whales alone? 40 some dolphins?Maybe something else interactive? Something along the lines of the art contest, perhaps.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A fanfiction challenge - or a poetry writing contest.You give them a set topic, characters involved, pairings (if any), one major thing that must happen in the story and they have to build the rest around it. For a poetry one you would give them a set topic, a limit on how many stanzars you are to write, what types of poems are wanted (Say you wanted an Ode to be the set poem, then you say that and tell them what you don't want ie. Lymeric or Haiku..etc)Just an idea ;)

For an little nothing joke, my comment seems to have stirred quite a response. I believe in a god, and I'll leave it it that, seeing as how I almost posted a whole book on this matter before deleting it all. I am both a person of science and religion, for they are not mutually exclusive. Diversity is what the world is based upon, and I do not feel it is right for fanatics to go around telling everyone what to believe in, or believing they are right and everyone else is wrong.*Steps off the soap box before thinks of something else to say*PS: As for the goddess thing, I had Greco-Roman mythology in mind at the time.

Well lemme just say I don't think Jiff is coming back. He runs his own site, and you can check it out if you want at www.only-film.com where he goes by the name "Sam Gournay". Ahem. Give him a surprise visit! :D To be honest I don't know why he registered...we were both looking at Arkonviox at school when he just decided to register again for no reason as Harold Zidler! Beigyopps.

Geez... I leave for a week and look at all this stuff that happens. @_@ Huzza!Anyways... New sections would be good. The Ecco Cookbook is all messed up, and I think that should be fixed. I think that there should be a gallery for all the Ecco scans and stuff. I mean, there's a lot here, but they're littered all over the place, which makes them hard to find. Maybe something for that kind of stuff?

If the teacher allows me to do a "fan game" for my Macromedia Flash game, in the Animaltion class I might as well employ my joke about Arkon starting small and work up to great game making skills by making a simple flash game with ecco charas.Insted of cars or ships(space or other) or even insted of horseies or dogs, they will be ecco charasI'm guessingEccoDelphinusTara/blackfinKitneeTrellia and mabye some DoTF kinds.the story so far as why they are racing is that the're goning to take a trip to Atlantis, but one corridor is haunted, the looser of most races has to spend the night primerlly in said corridor/coutyard.so  of course you don't want to loose.

Indeed yes, the series starts out great, and the first 13 or so epps are good but then the storyline starts to trail off, interesting characters get killed off for no reason while others just fade away, Shinji gets more and more anoying with his spastic-self-lothing-fits, and the end just shuves the proverbial pineapple up the ass!

I've read many a mythology book and that's the first time I've heard that particular discription. I have several books on Japanese and Chinese Mythology, I'll have to go read up on this subject.  If I find any interesting tidbits, I'll be sure to post 'em.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
All good ideas. Doomtrain is right; a lot of suff is unorganized. And I dont mean to be an ass, but Dread and Trell...if you could keep that in a private message? Id like to keep this one on topic, as we need lots of ideas. I am going to gather what you all have, and discuss it with arkon. Then maybe we can get some stuff together.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Alright. First note, all of your ideas have been taken into account. And I talked to ark. He said first, to make a section of my own idea; Prove myself. After that, of course, Your ideas will be definitely taken into account, as they are all very good. This new section i have come up with, is based on ecco the dolphin. Inspired by Histronic and delphi. One day, hist said, "Vortex came in a ship" or something to that affect. and we argued, that they were not in a ship, but on a planet. And in delphi's new idea for a backstory, she asked about the technical jargon for time machines. That is what this section is for; to explain thigns down to a finepoint. It will showcase such things like Vortex anatomy, the technicalities of atlantis machines, how glyphs would have worked, how the vortex planet was run, and other such things. Now, As earth clan members, you are all going to work on this as well, by contributing your thoughts. How you think certain aspects could be proved technically sound. Got a graph showing mass and size of the vortex queen? Show it. Anything like that. So, please, if you have ideas, contribute! This could be a cool section if you all help.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have always had an interest with the Vortex race, so my thought always dwell upon them. I have long pondered about the size of the queen herself, and upon seeing her in the first game, she is rather a huge beast. A thought upon her size came accross my head and it deals with Ecco himself. Maybe we can compare their sizes? A male bottlenose dolphin can be 13 feet long. Knowing the size of a bottlenose can give us a rough estimate on the queen's size as well? Does anybody understand this? I certaintly hope so. As for the body? Does she have one or not? That is pretty much a guess there....  Another thought that came accross my head is that the Planet Vortex comes every 500 years to consume upon the earth. It makes me wonder what they do during that long wait, certaintly all that food they receive from earth cannot last that long, I have long thought that they fed upon other planets. This is just a simple thought, but i thought it was worth mentioning. The Vortex anatomy is very interesting. I read somewhere that the queen went back into the past and became part of the planet's evolution, turning into things with exo-skeletons. Am I right? Anyways, if we were left to assume that they did have exo-skeletons then how would they be able to survive on earth? I say this because if most of the animals we know of today (crabs, spiders) were to grow larger, the  gravity would crush them. But I also remember a part of the ToT game where if you lead a Vortex close to the surface, it would die. A change in pressure perhaps? That would mean that the Vortex could not dwell upon the land.Anways, these are some ideas i had brewing in my head. I think i would like to work on a section for vortex, i like anatomy (one of my favorite subjects) so i would like to contribute!  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I am very glad that everyone here is enjoying the pictures i draw. I hope i can get some avatars of my character from all the artist here, as you can pretty much tell, i change my avatars frenquently. I hope i am not bothering any one here.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Nope... but you know, there's so much anime out there, I think there should be a separate channel dedicated all to anime!

<div id='container'>
Well, I'm on episode 9 right now, and it's great. I hope what you say aint true though, as it's flug-tastic at the moment. :D

Heh, oh so true, it'd be really nice if we set up a gallery with free privelages to ADD scans to it, and the ability to change the captions with it. Nice idea Doomy :)

<div id='container'>
A few random thoughtsI've often noticed that the clan dolphins bear some resemblance to Orcas. For instance, they are bigger, have larger pectoral fins, and longer, straight dorsal fins. I think it fits into the storyline by saying clan dolphins belnded the aspects of the Orca into themselves to become stronger by genetic experiments or breeding. They did say somewhere that they had the power (or was it knowledge?) to change themselves. Also, I've been thinking about the general in Ice and Fire, and may have an explaination. Admitedly, an odd one, but could also be applied to the other two exalted dolphins.With science fiction being a little hobby of mine, the idea of explaining the various aspects of the game appeals to me. I would say that I wouldn't want to try to explain the time machine, but just thinking a little about it starts to draw more and more attention.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well i do understand the fact that the blue whale can survive such a pressure, i was mostly referring to creatures who have exo-skeletions like crabs and insects. Many people have wondered why you don't see insects the size of other animal. there are many different sizes for birds, mammals, fish and the like but we tend to notice that insects remain of small size.  After doing some research on the subject , it is the gravity of the planet that prevents them from growing any bigger than their present size, they would get crushed! Now i sound like i am repeating myself, but aw well.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
They are the only things for sale are they?

well lesseethere is "base price"stickers are 2 bucks (have anything on them as long as it's not illegale)now, I want some money from my stickers lets say, so I make them 3 bucks more expencive.from sales i get the extra 3 and the company gets the base price(after all, cafepress is a 'free service')but...they expect me to sell 500 stickers 0_@ !print out paper is expencive.....12 dollars for 10 sheets....iron out printerpaper is unrealible, expencive and not foolproof...so if you goof you waste 2 bucks on one sheet of paper and 5 for a cheep tee.best bet for cloathing is to cash in near $ 2,000 bucks and buy a machine (unless i can find a cheep price)the mug maker is almost $ 2,000 as well.sell shirts at $23 (yes thats how much shirts cost mind you...it may cost $15 or more to do it professionaly....now when you have professional equptment you can change x amount too)in some time it may just pay for it's self.if you don't want money back, and just want people to be billboards keep everything at the base price.why if i can sell  my art will i?  to get the shirt press!(or get one from the blackmarket or police auction....

Ah yes! Good job guys! Lot's of niffty scans in there. And much more organized obviously.Does that review I scaned count? If it does, someone can upload it (I'm not signed up). The url is http://www.geocities.com/doomstuff/eccoreview.jpgGood job guys! I think there's enough in it for Arkon to make an update on it.

Yeah... I usually set my prices about $1.50 over the base price. But it's the shipping and handling that kills you! It's like... $7! Fuck... that's more then the sticker itself. @_@

Callyfin its cool you added all those scans but did you ask PsySonic? We can't use those scans because they don't belong to us. I might have to delete all of them since mostly all of them came from psy's site. If he found out about that we could find ourselves in a second website war. To be honest i don't have time for it anymore. that and im apart of there community too and im risking a ban.The scans section is closed until further notice.

i havent deleted them cause i know you put alot of work to collect those and put them in that section. so calm your ass down. i'm not trying to piss you off purpoosely but i found some of those scans came from psysonics site. i'll probably readd the scans section back as it is. but your gonna have to help me find which ones where psysonics and which ones werent. i compared them with psys and the scans were identitle down to the last dust mark. the sections still there but your gonna have to help me decided what goes where. we can't keep scans that he scanned. hes a bitch about it and you know it. thats what caused the last fight, i tried to make an interesting things section thats devided by games and he bitched about it.the fact i am aware of is this. eventualy were gonna be a selfupdating community. this is probably gonna happen again and again and again. but i have to show i put some sort of effort into stopping it.so...maybe we can have our cake and eat it too...callyfin, let me know which scans are yours and which are his. im not gonna delete them yet but i got an idea...one thing i can already see is people here want that scans section up. so before i do anything lets collect the scans that arent ours and belong to psy.callyfin i opened the section so you and everyone else can view it. i could use any help for anyone who wants to help cally do this. we need to check and see what scans belnog to psy and which ones don't. so go through both sections and check. then post them here.http//www.planetdreamcast.com/cavernsofhope/downloads/art/scans.shtmlim not gonna delete them. i just need to know. you got to put your anger to the side for this once just to assist me with this. i'm not gonna take them down just for one person and you can see where im getting at with this. but...at the same time i have to be fair.

shadow your are not allowed to lock this topic no matter how flame ridden it becomes. i'm allowing it!i invited psysonic to come and defend himself over this despute. im gonna have to probably take them down but maybe you guys can convince him otherwise.

A valid point Atrius, as water does present resistance and support of sorts, though it also amplifies the pressure as it gets deeper, yet it is known, though not always proven, tha tthe deeper you go in the ocean, the bigger the things you find. Think of the giant squid of ledgends past, that does infact exist though there are no records of a fully grown one, there ARE records of a baby that was caught in a fishing net, when hung to its full length it was the size of a young child (about 11-15 yeasrs) and yet the tests suggest that it is only a few days old.... so imagion what it would look like in a week or more..... The same counts for simple fish in exeptionally deep lakes, they are but HUGE... As for the vortex.... if they are as technologically advanced as is claimed they would no doubt be out warring/raiding/plundering OTHER regions in that 500 years and look on earth only as a.... snackbar of sorts. Or perhaps they hibenate, and only awake to feed and sleep again.

September 11th.It's today one of the most horrible "birthdays" ever.And I wanted to explain how I felt last year, and now.09/11/01It was approximately 2.50 pm in France, and I was calmly watching a film at TV.Suddenly, the program stops, and one of the most famous french speaker  appears at the screen, announcing a special flash"No, it's impossible...It...It must be a film ! I can't believe it !"I called my dad, and we watched this flash together.Soon after, there was a the second impact. We were horrified.  We couldn't move.When my mom came back to home after shopping, she was as shocked as my father and me.At first, I couldn't realize.It's just some days after that I really understand what happened, and were the consequences. I was so sorry - and worried about some Americans I knew.September 13th, there was a minute of silence in my school.I respected it with a deep emotion, thinking of all these missing persons.Today, I watched most of the documentaries about this event; and I must admit I cried...All those scared, unhappy faces, those people sticking photos of members of their family everywhere (walls, cars...)...I remember it, and I feel so sad, so powerless...*** I dedicate this message to all the loved ones, lost in the disaster of the September, 11th 2001; and to all the families who now miss somebody...Employees, passers-by, but also Firefighters; all these persons who lost their lives, working, and trying to save everybody else...Repose in peace, now...You'll never be forgotten... ***Tomorrow brings a new adventure.But for now...Rest easy heroes. (Sonic Adventure 2)

That was very kind of you Sten. And I'll stand by you in that.I think  911 made everyone realize a lot. I know I did.It's amazing how that day effected the world. It's that day that everyone could tell you where they were, or what they were doing. If I asked you what you were doing October 17 of last year, you probably couldn't tell me. But Tuesday, September 11 will always stick.Sten is from France and I'm a Canadian, and it still hit us just as hard. I could never understand the feelings of families who lost someone, for I didn't, but I still felt the emptiness. The loss of faith. The hurt. The anger. I felt all that. I watched those planes hit those buildings, over... and over... and over. I watched them collapse on the survivors and firefighters and police. I watched the world stand still for that one day....I watched the violence.But then I also watched the lines up's of people giving blood. The flowers and candles lined up for miles for the victims. The prayers. The people giving up their homes for others. I watched all that too. And it felt good to watch all that kindness. But the fact that it took a day like September 11 to bring that out of people really slapped me in the face. I realized that it shouldn't take a day like September 11 bring out our kindness. If we just did it all the time, there wouldn't be day's like September 11.As much as I, or people, like to think it brought the world closed together, I find that it set us farther apart. It brought more violence, more hate, more war and death. It's so unfortunate too. It should have ended. But it didn't. I realized that it is unlikely to ever end, and that it's a real shame.It feels like it just happened yesterday too. A whole year went by so quickly. I realize now that I did nothing with it too. We were all reminded of it almost everyday, but how many of us acted on it?I only hope that this day will be a constant wake up call for us and not a constant reminder of hate and violence. We don't need to remember all the evil that happened that day, but we must remember all the good and act on it.

Yeah, it's really sad. Then there was this couple holding hands who thought they could jump out of the building and land on their feet.

Hey, that snackbar has a tradition to keep. Ever notice that in movies and such, its always the puny people of Earth who defeat the advanced aliens who have exterminated several species already?Back on topic, I scribbled a little nonsence to explain the glyph, circa Ecco 1 and 2.The glyphs were originally created by the Atlantean Cassandra to aid Ecco centuries later.  These glyphs needed to be self-sufficient and be usable by dolphins.  If they had any outside requirements, they would not last until Ecco's time.  Therefore, the glyphs work by using the dolphin's own sonar.Within each glyph are several resonance chambers. When the sound waves of a dolphin's sonar hit the glyph, they are distorted in the chambers as then are sent out, modified into whatever the prerecorded message or song the glyph was built for.If a glyph is shattered, the message can not be properly played back until the glyph is reassembled with its matching half and chambers.I'll work out a little more to include the glyphs from DotF, which I believe have some connection with the Gaurdian. If so, then it's psychic abilities will be a factor in, say, the movie glyphs.

It's funny. A year ago, I had never heard the name 'Osama bin Laden,' now probably the most hated in America.Well, with me living in NY and all, it does have a little more impact. Not as much as it probably should, though. NYC is on the other side of the state from me. I bet Kit or Eao would have been closer. It's very comforting to see people of other nations mourn with the U.S.Unlike Sten, it was fairly early in the day for us. I went into the third class of the day, and on the TV were the two burning towers. I just stood there. Eventually I moved to the center of the room, but I must have stood for 10-15 minutes. Ironically enough, it was my social studies class (ie current events) so we just watched it. The principal and on of the secretaries came into the room (my class was one of the first to know what had happened.) I remember the announcer saying 'Is that another airplane?' and I could feel time stop. As it turned out, it was just a news helicopter. Then they showed the Pentagon, just hit, and I heard the secretary gasp 'Oh, my God' from the back of the room.When the first tower collapse, we didn't really know what had happened. But I knew that if it had fallen, there was probably little hope for the other one. Right about now, the class ended, and I had to go to math. Maybe half of the school now was aware of what was happening, but the teacher insisted on teaching her lesson. Toward the end of the class, the TV was turned on, and a few minutes later, the second tower fell. There wasn't much left to watch on TV now so we didn't complain too much when my Bio teacher taught for half of the class. He first explained what was happening (there were still a few people who didn't know what had happened) And I think now is when I learned of the plane crash in Pennsylvania. Between classes (Bio lab was next) the school superintendant talked with my teacher, then later the principal came on the PA and the rest of the day was devoted to watching the news. And we watched the plane hit again and again and again. They really messed up there. They should have sent us home to be with our families.My mother was very worried the whole day. She didn't tell us until later that it was because she hadn't heard news about her cousin, who works near the area, and passes through the WTC complex on her way there. We were lucky, she wasn't there at the time.I still find myself shedding a tear when they talk about it on the news. Today, school paused for a moment of silence at the moments of impact and of collapse of each tower. I'm told this was being done all across the state.Well, that's that. We can only hope that this event makes changes for the better. I must say, when all of congress came out and sang the national anthem, it was encouraging to see their unity. All it took was a terror attack. It was dissapointing to hear that some misguided Americans chose to take out their anger on the Muslim population within the U.S. Salem had their witches. McCarthy had his communists. And today we have our arab terrorists. It is unfortunate when people fear their differances, rather than their commonalities.It's on the news right now. The must be showing every single picture and movie taken of it.

Shadow has already screwed around with some of my earth clan stuff, changing an anouncement I made to a topic for some reason. and WHY exactly is this topic moved to Arkonviox.com discussion? It is clearly meant for earth clan. Maybe tell someone about the stuff you do before you start screwing around with peoples threads. Im only moderator of EC, but since it was my topic, I should at least know why it is here now.

It was a truly sad day. I was walking to school when i heard about it, as I dont usually watch the TV. A buddy of mine came up, and said, "Yeah, some assholes smashed into the twin towers." I was thinking, "What are you talking about? Twin towers WHERE?" And then I got home and saw the news flash. For a month. it is really haunting, seeing such an event, and being old enough to comprehend what it was. My mom actually called me home from a friends when it happened cause she was so worried. I pray for all the people, and the peoples families who were involved in a hideous event. I dont have much else to say than that. It was awful.

..I was at work. Bathing a dog. I stopped dead when the music on the radio was interupted by a news bullitin about a plane crashing into the first tower at 8:46 my time. I thought to myself "How the hell can a plane crash into the tallest buildings in N.Y? It's not like you can't see 'em for f***'s sake." Here I was, thinking of a small private jet or prop-plane. A few minutes later, while I was wondering if it was a radio joke or hoax of some kind, the raido person yelled out that a second plane hit the second tower. When that happened~ I as well as everyone else, knew it was no accident.I phoned my brother, waking him up, and told him to turn on CNN and get a tape in the VCR. I knew it was going to be a major event. I just didn't know HOW big at the time.Less that 45 minutes later, the towers fell. The raido called out, and all I remember was falling into my chair in stunned silence. No one thought they would fall~ but they did. That was the most surreal trip home I've ever undertaken.  No one was talking on the bus, just empty stairs out the windows. Downtown had been evaccuated earlier in the day so the buses were nearly empty. Rush hour has never been so quiet and subdued. Everyone knew what was happeneing, and everyone knew that it was going to change everything.I went home~ saw the tape my bro' had recorded~ saw the bodies falling out of the towers, saw the planes hit....over and over and over. I took pills to sleep that night. Even now~ every time I see the footage of that second plane diving into the second tower~ I cry.

Take the initiative of putting it back the way it was if Shadow does.And Cally, we're trying to run this as smoothly as possible as our own site, we cant be using PsySonics scans sinces he'll cry over them like he's done before. (No Offense Psy, but thats what it looks like)I can understand yer fed up with some of Arkons ideas on the section matters but you'd have to see it through his eyes and the eyes of someone who runs Arkonviox.com and you might see where hes comin from. :PThe last thing we need is any disputes amung site members and staff, contributors and what not. Next time try to handle it in a more mature manner then going into some kinda nervous breakdown. Leave that to Dolphin. ;)

Ahhh yes, I can remember that day... very clearly. Mind if i share?It was six in the morning over here in California. I was ready to go to college but very worried about a sociology exam that was going to be later on that day. I was waiting for my boyfriend to come and pick me so i decided to write him a letter. *sigh* I remember what I put in there too. "I wonder what will happen today?" it said. Moments later the phone rang, it was my father telling me to put on the TV, at that time my boyfriend was pulling up. I saw it for a brief moment, The pentagon was on fire. That was all I could see before i left. I told my boyfriend about this but he said that it was the towers that were on fire. We had a brief argument but as we appproached the school our friends, next to a radio, told us it was both.However, we still had a exam to do and as we approached the cafe that was next to the student store, we saw the first tower fall. Our spirits were crushed, there was no way we could do our exam. Almost all the class flunked it, but we were allowed a retake.Anyways, that day, the school was so dead. One thing I had always liked about my school was that it was so lively. That was not the case that day, everything was dead, classes were canceled... it was a sad dismal day.Ahhh, i feel somewhat better saying this. Thank you for reading.

the scans section is closed until i can get some physical proff that some of those scans don't come from caverns of hope. if so i can leave them and keep the section running. right now i have no proff. callyfin i compared those scans with psys. those are his scans to the last detail. but if he got those scans from another site we can keep them on ours. if not im gonna have to delete them. the section is closed for now. i dont want to delete them yet because i know it was alot of work to add them and its alot of work for me to go through it and delete them.callyfin by the way i have every right to get pissed of so don't fucking piss me off. this is my site and i have rules and they go like this..."my way or the highway" what that means is its eithier my way or no way. i run this site its arkonviox.com! -Arkonviox- dot com. which means i have full right to treat everyone like shit if i see fit. i know as a fact those are psys scans but....if psy took them from another site we can keep them. but i betcha alot those are his and your wrong. but if im wrong them i owe you an apology. but if your wrong then i have the right to say you are full of shit.don't you dare ever try to argue with me...GOT IT?!and shadow don't you dare lock this topic. this is gonna be settled my way. i told you already callyfin last time you tried to give me those scans that we cant use them.you may have rememebred when we had some of those stolen scans in earth clan but there not here no more. i only put them in earth clan cause this is a secret group. but you guys got to relize we have members of caverns of hope that post here and view our forum. silverfin is co owner and i don't plan to desrespect my new friends. argue with me...die...prove to me im wrong then i apologize. i relly want to see if your bluffing though.

i went over some of the scans. some of them have barcodes on them that should'nt match psys scans but they do. barcodes and certain codes on some of these games should have been unique but they arent. that means the scans did come from psys site.the game gear, the dreamcast, most all of them belong to psys. i did notice certain ones done but most of the scans section were stolen from psysoncs site without permission.callyfin you better have good proff they came from a site other than psysoncs site. because i gathered enough proff that you lied to me. and im disappointed and pissed.

that resident evil dream was as bad as the one io had when i had to kill a monkey with an orange crayon.DoTF is giving me nightmarish dreams....althou i haven't re-played roaring forces i drempt I was beeing chased by an underwater allosaurs...who could even fit into small holes.  Then ecco turned into a water walking velociraptor!  there was a crocidile in Blades of motion...which turned into me playing with a rubber ecco, who got chewed up...and when i dyed and the level re-started the rubber ecco was still broken.  Some more weird stuff to turn into in Roraing Forces...there was a pool with little "rubber dolphins" if you held one and flicked it (Arkon....) it would move...but they were kinda like mini real dolphins...cuz i grabed one and it was squriming.but then they were a beta version of a toy, i wanted these toy 'phins but could have them because they were "going back".  then i was sad because of my simmitrey skills, and i wanted to improve on them, but they only allowed the people with simmitrey skills (although youcould just make half a dolping toy and duplacate the other half)but there were so many 2 inch dolphins....and i was grabing them.ah that was last night.  the allosaurs was 2 nights ago.i miss my old ecco dreams, with real-like levels that never existed...now I play 3d ecco i know what it's like....my dream 3d world was more 3d ish and expansive.

Okay. this topic is the same one as arkon dropped. I dont want ANY more flames here, or any such crap like that. (Of course, I wont defy arkons word either, but id like to keep this one for what it was meant for.) So Please dont let this one turn to crap this time. Add any info, and section ideas here. Thanks.

I remember.It was 4th period, which was lunch time for me (I ate really early in the morning, 4th period starts at 10:15 AM).  I was putting books into my locker. The hallway was empty, sans a few teachers and me. I had just closed the door to my locker when our principal came over the PA system and said that the World Trade Center had been hit. I froze - I just couldn't believe what I had heard. Annoyed, angry, I slammed the hallway door behind me and fumed to lunch. While in lunch, our principal came over the PA again and told us the second tower had been hit and was falling. After lunch, I had Webpage Design. My teacher was crying - that day, her brother had to go on a business trip, and he was on a plane. She had no idea if he was on one of the two planes that had crashed. She had her cell phone and was calling her family. It truns out, thank God, her brother was not on any of the three planes. A friend of mine's Dad worked at the WTC - that day, he had a migrane and didn't go into work. If he had, he would have been killed as the other 3, 030 people. We still had school, for whatever reason. We didn't go home early. We even had a math quiz. It made me so pissed that my math teacher was going along like nothing had happened. When we were talking about it, she told us to be quiet and take the quiz; that was 8th period, the last period of the day. The whole thing made me indifferent - I didn't cry at all. I was unaffected. The only time I cried was when I saw those bastards from Pakistan throwing a party and burning our American flag. That was the only time I cried. Call me what you will - heartless, unfeeling, unpatriotic. I don't know - it just didn't affect me at all.And now I'm sick of hearing about it. The media has completed saturated us with all of this Sept. 11th stuff. I'm just so sick of hearing about it weeks before it ever happened, and I'm so sick of hearing people say, "Oh, there's going to be another attack on this Sept. 11th!" I actually read that in a newspaper. It was amazing to me, how the press could cause national panic like that.

<div id='container'>
Actually, I started thinking about the teleport rings today. I'm thinking one-way wormholes or an accelerator maybe. Another idea was that they are somehow connected with the time machine. And as for the gaurdian's glyphs, that was the line I was looking for.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah maybe your right. I am going to make it a monthly thing. Like, how comics are released once a month? as will my new true to life Self-Portraits.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah. I know. What if earth didnt have years? this "years" September elleventh would just remain another day, and wouldnt be looked back at annually. It was a terrible event. But as a canadian, it didnt affect me either. "That sucks, but I dont live their." Hell, i dont even think i knew what the twin towers WERE before this stuff happened. Still, my condolences go out to all the people that do, and all the people that were affected.

It has been a while since i last set foot in the movie theatre, the last movie being "Reign of Fire" and they could have done a better job at it. Good movie though.Anyways, what movies do you guys recommend, i feel like going on a renting spree this weekend or going to the theatres itself.One thing that i have always enjoyed is movies that gave everyone a good laugh. One in particular is the Monty Phthon movie D http://www.garlic.com/~dgareis/Misc/grail.complete.asciiAnyways, i wanted to share this wonderful item with everyone. Of course the movie is so much better. Enjoy!

<div id='container'>
The most disturbing and uncalled for picture/footage that I'v ever seen is when they showed people jumping out of the windows of the towers....They showed still pics of people just hanging there,falling.....The sad part is,they showed peoples pictures after they hit the ground,witch I think was uncalled for. I didn't want to see that! One more thing, I think it's dumb that they call it the "Attack on America" because it wasn't called the Amerian trade center,it's the World trade center. There were people from over 70 countries in there.....it's the "Attack on the World"..... :(

Unfortunately the more you talk about things like this the angrier people get about them. I mean... it's situations like are occurring right now (IE - war on Iraq) that cause things like Sept. 11th to happen.Huh. The thing is, last year, I didn't even know what had happened until I got home from school. I realized a whole pile of people were talking about this big 'something' but I never actually heard it said that planes had crashed into the WTC. I got home and my Dad was watching the news, and then I was like.... "Um..... well." I'm so clueless...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Huh. Well, the Atlantis story I'm going to write (speaks to self: "Hear that, Delphi? GOING TO WRITE!!!!!"), I'm dealing with the same things as you, Artreus. Actually, it'll be cool to have a few ideas on how the Glyphs/Teleport rings work (for my story I've figured out my version of the Glyphs, and I'm just working on the Teleport rings now). Ecco fandom. Joy.

"bravely bold sir robin..." Yes, i have seen it. A million fucking times. Funniest movie ever. Same with meaning of life. i love monty python. as for good movies, Screw movies right now. The box office is crap as far as Im concerned. I heard of a cool gang movie, kinda old, like 2 years, called "brother" And i was gonna buy it today; i think i will pick it up tommorrow. It is about Yakuza. Coo'.

Ahhh Sir Robin. That song went like this    Bravely bold Sir Robin rode forth from Camelot.    He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.    He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways,    Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!        He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp,    Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken,    To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away    And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!    His head smashed in and his heart cut out    And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged    And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off    And his pen--That brings back memories and then i think of that rabbit.... You know what I am talking about Phosis!  :D

<div id='container'>
Actually, the rabbit and  the grail appeared in a old 3d shooter called "shadow warrior", in a hidden zone. That was the curious fact of the day.

Someone around here has been lock happy recently. Your topic seemed mostly on topic, which is why I've suggested a special cetacean discusion area, so people who don't want to see this stuff don't have to.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You will have to personally request that from Arkon, art. I don't have any say. I suggested a section for ceteacens, but that idea was not very good. A new topic is a good idea though. Inquire with Arkon about it; maybe your wish will be granted.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, I have had some problems lately. My back went out on me two days ago; apparently I have scoliosis. My right vertebrae was pushed, and a muscle torn, and I have had chiropractical work done, and physical therapy. I was not able to sit on the computer for long periods of time, which is why I wasn't seen in Darkseas. I feel a bit better now, though I can still barely sit, and should be able to do some work with Earth Clan tonight. Sorry for the delays.

not much to explain,i mean we can talk about what bands we hate love request songs there where to get some cd's and basically anything pertaining to music will go there. i think it'll help so that when a member is looking for a certain song or they are trying to talk about a band they like, they can post it there so that the other forums aren't filled ewith mixed threads like music in ecco discussion ect.   see my point?

<div id='container'>
How about a section for game glitches? It sounds silly, but the glitches are fun to find not to mention strange.A few glitches i remeber is one from the first ecco game, in dark water, sometimes if you leap from a certain height the sky will glow violet in purple. And then  there is defender of the future, which is loaded with glitches.

Can anyone help me with fluidity level? I get most of the way thru the level, but when I get to the high yellow door near the end, it isn't open. I have tried everything, but can't figure out how to open it. I assume I am supposed to follow the sequence the crystal speaks of, red, green, red/green, blue/yellow, no color, blue/yellow, no color,... but I cannot find the first red or figure out where I am supposed to start this sequence. It seems to me that the first door is red/green, and I cannot open the last door. Please help. Thanks!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Bah, I think I shall visit that site and see what they don't have. Anyways, as i read Dread's idea it made me think about Ecco's own music. I know that most of the songs can be downloaded from here, but I don't think that there are many people out there who know that the game also had a soundtrack. I don't think that it was mentioned on this site either. Thats what I thought anyways....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That is a troublesome level.It has been awhile since i last played it, lemme check my little "map"This should work, dunno if you have the dreamcast or ps2 version though....Activate the trigger in the minefield to green and go into the door to your left. Exit the tunnel, ignore the switch in this room and enter the tunnel below you. Trigger the switch  in  the next room and then swim back to the switch you ignored. Go into the new door above, activate the switch in the next room and the one in the room after that. Swim back one room, deactivat the switch and then swim all the way back to the room with the two white doors. There should be a new white door to go trough.wah, reading through this makes me remember how frustrating this level was. If it is still confusing, (i betcha it is) there should be guides on this site that can help you.hope this helps!  :D

Wars are only necessary in that it's a most recognizable and simple way to answer a problem. However, it is not necessarily a solution. If we go to war on Iraq again, it will show how little worth the Persian Gulf war had ten years ago. It was a quick fix to some problems and set in motion several other. People don't fight wars like WW2 anymore, and even that had rather unplesant effects.

I see what your getting at Dlord. I mean... music is a very powerful thing and lot's can be said about it, but I just don't think everyone would have enough to say to fill a whole board. I do think it would make a very interesting topic though!There was a topic a while back about music//arkonviox.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=34 not the same thing, I know, but perhaps if you are interested.And I was thinking guys... If Phosis is "leader" of the Earth Clan now, then he's pretty high on the importance list. Why not just make him mod of all the boards instead of just the one that people post least in? Pho is good and reasonable, and I think he'd make a find mod for all the other boards that are often bastardized. Hm?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Get well Pho!!! Take it easy, alright.

i've had scoliosis all my life.....2 surgeries and a lot of mentail emotional pain.I'd like to barge onto some beauty pagents and maim those idot souless pretty "humanwomans" to such a digree not even any kind of god can fix them.to so they know the pain of not having 'assets' so they can't buy cloating easy...so they cannot breath and that no doctor or anything can fix them.i've had a herrinton rod in my back...now the lower spine is crooked...my head and hips aren't alingned....my lunges are squashed because of my back....i can't 'get it fixed' via operatoion because of my weak lunges.not that it would help...my head would drasticly look like it was put on wrong even if my spine would be a bit strait.i'd also like to maim the god-king who makes the rules of cloathing.  some lecturus old coot probebly some sick woman who thinks she's a man thats a lechturs sexpot.then they cannot adorn the cloathing they ordain...so they know what it feels like to have small choices and how crule the social comunist-like rules are.*slinks off*

Hi! Haven't seen me for a while huh? Been a little RP insane this summer.    *sweatdrops* Yeah... anyway, I'm back. Just to let you all know. Well I think you all don't remember me anyway... being so far gone from here. Oy... feel free to hit me with my TAM (Titanium Alloy Mallet) if you want.

Ecco Racersdang......  8O I remeber talking of such game with Blackfin (Undercaves days) on chat a looong time ago......it was mostly like this: Arkon, Crestoe, Friecco and the others are all playable, while the rest/most of their respected forms are available only as secret characters (including Ecco himself).
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Happy B-Day Crest

I haven't forgotten about you! It's good to have you back, Miana! Let's have it for keeps now, eh? ^_-

<div id='container'>
Nope, I ain't scared off yet! Yep, my friend is both a caverns and arkonviox chic, but I'll leave it there.I'm currently in the process on a couple of fics for this site, although I have a bunch of poetry I'll put up soon.I don't get online too often, so don't expect too much straight away...

<div id='container'>
Hi Muta....yup, thats it. ._.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh, well thanks for the support, doom! But I wouldnt worry about it too much. Let the mods decide, i say. If they need me, sure I will do it. But it is not a big deal if they dont. Sorry Dlord but It was NOT meant to be offensive. All I am saying, is that there is an OT board all ready, and since this is an ecco site, we do not need a seperate topic, which is also off topic. This IS still a site based on a game. And in my opinion, and arkons, it should stay that way. The topic is a good idea, I will give you that, But it does not fit.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hahah. Well, you know where to checkout all my artwork, of course. The most lovely site called Caverns of Hope, run by Silverfin, and the other guy.

<div id='container'>
Well I recently read Time Strider, my own fanfic. Though it has evolved considerably, It is RIDDLED with errors, bad punctuation, and unresolved, never to BE resolved plotlines. I am going to take some time, and with what I have, about 27000 words, I am going to re sculpt it into a likable format, getting rid of mistakes, and basically putting the story together again. I have many ideas for it, so think of the current posting of TS as a kind of rough draft. This model is not going to be changed completely, but there are many elements I want to implement, Mainly better descriptions. The descriptions in the current draft are lacking, at best. Some characters as well need a tune up, as there characters are not developed. This is my FIRST plan. My second, which I am thinking about, is to take the ecco theme away. For those who read the story as it is brought out, it may seem difficult, like it would ruin the story. But after thinking about it, losing the Ecco elements of it could be EASILY compensated for, and would even fit better into the quest itself. I never said TS was a permanent thing. I had always thought about a redo, and well, here it is. It will have most of the same characters, and the same basic plot, but it will not be based around ecco, as it has evolved. Originally, it was perceived as a completely different, non ecco related theme. Then, it slowly turned into what it is, a quest for ecco. While I love ecco, and I love writing fanfictions about it, I have enough words under my belt to see where the story is REALLY going, and to change how I see fit. Just a little note for those interested.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That's odd, I've been considering the same thing. Well, almost. When I first started writing SoR, I had little idea where it was going other than defeating the bad guy. But since then (I've had nearly a year or so to think it over) I begin to think about the holes in it. Mostly just along the lines of character development. Like I said, now that I know what's going on, it will make it easier to work with, and If I start the rewrite, I may gather enough momentum to break through that writer's block in part 3. Anything more, I won't say. I'm planning on laying low while I work on all this, then flood the site with several completed projects.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
8O I've revived a forum member. Maybe I should drop PMs more often... Well then, welcome back Miana.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah, that's cool. I had thought about doing it for so long. What finally pushed me, was an interview with my fave author. He said, "Once I get about 50000 words down, there is enough material to change, re format, and re edit, then finally complete the story." Then i thought. "Yes."
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
A good way to do the Ecco film would be CG as animation is considered too... childish. A good story would be the Tidesinger Trilogy by GTK, it's the best ever Ecco story I've ever read. If you haven't read it, DO IT!Oh, and for the agenda, I've studying to be a film director. An Ecco film would be high on my list of films to make.  8)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well...I have never read that. Maybe i should. I heard it was good...it received high accolades. I always wanted someone to make a StarCon movie....never thought about ecco, really.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
My thought about the movie would be if the general public would like to go and see it. It is known that movies based on video games dont tend to do that well. If a movie was to be made, how can it be made in such a way that all will like it?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
yes i closed it, start a new topic. as for this topic i answered the question so now shall it be closed.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Miana! its been a long time.I was wondering if you would be coming back. dolphin and crest were talking about you and i was saying hopefully she'll be back in the fall again. it be kinda crappy if you didn't come abck. your one of those who been with this site from the start and sad to say were becomnig a rare breed. this site has grown into a big assed monster of a site....a year ago i ever thought it be possible.I remember when we wer ebegging for newbies now im having a hard time keeping up.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thanks Atolm, I'll try your advice...I'll try anything at this point.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

Damnit, we hope to see you totally fixed man, if not, COH oekaki board will feel lonely and abandoned and we shall close it forever and ever.About you, Eao, there are millions of women with clothing problems.The society/cloth makers are specially cruel with women, and  they push you to be (too) slim and well shaped. If not, just forget about get normal clothing like everybody. There are a ton of female depressions/suicides/sickness due such stuff, but while devilish media like TV gives you the supermodel image as the model to follow, there's not much to do about it.Welcome to the domain of the beautiful people.And Dreadlord, about your new signature, it's fucking good and exquisite. (And with this, you earn +10 charisma points).Rammstein = Gods.

i did all my Advitats with the mouse, but now i spoil myself with my tablet...thus hampering my skills for school work.*looks*i wounder if Crestoe drew that ontop of the one he did for WhiteFin?  I kinda do that...i use the PSD file for the size, erease the stuff and do somthing newmabye the 3 eyed dolphin will let me do one....or i can continue not to do advitars for people, or anything because in my "greatness of talent" i get no commissions.i suppose i suck then?to get a pic like mine, try doing a polygon-sprite glitch and "move through" a dolphin...for 2 nanoseconds that happend to me with a clan dolphin or that idiot in CoH. (the one ya gotta push with th sonar)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
the best thing of taking out the ecco elements is that now your story is legal..you can make a web page to your tale, and make merchindice..if it's good enough for publishing and shoving it onto the media you won't get sued, or need to be affilated withany one.Eao is better now as an un-fan chara.as i stated once before...."eao was a decendet of ecco and loved the tales of her ancestor's bravery but was sad that he dissipeared into the time stream so she went on her own adventure to save him"now"eao is the un-dolphin, crule and egotistic she thinks nothing but of her own gain, it all should belong to her and she is the utmost important being.  For her acts of greed she was punished and now works as a 'go for' for the lady leviathain, the ruling ethral beast of water, sadly for her human faith turned her into a monster of the greed sin, owning water, whic is universal and everwhere and impiortant to life, this best suited her. What eao is imployed to do is a mystery, all eao knows is that she has been granted supernatural powers, one of them shapeshiting.  her current, seemingly endless quest is to gather the shatterd parts of an artifact know as 'the lotus' which brings this dolphin to many parts of earth, above and below the sea.  There is also legends of activation orbs, vital to the usage of this flower.  but gaining them is an adventure of it's own"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh, yeah I tend to leave for long times ne? I'll make a mental note to look at this forum more often before heading to the RP one. Promise.Yeah, I'm one of the older ones, post count doesn't say it because Arkon liked changing the forums back in the day. ^^ I've been with this site from the beginning, so I'm gonna stick with this site for as long as I can. This is basically the only decent Ecco website I've seen so far.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
is this a forum thing now?unless we split the OT up into spesific areas like Tech help...or answers to things.as for the page, the science of Ecco is intreguing...like how the Man's nighmare dolphins build stuff...the red makeup in DoTF ecco adornsTrellia dolphins...........how they fly with heliuem
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oddly enough in Sorcerous Stabebr Orphen (anime) there are theses crystals with runic messages in them, when held upto the ligh you can project the text onto a wall.or if you blow one up after tossing it into the sky the messages will be scatterd into the sky, using the sunlight to refract the text.but then it goes bye bye.I just though it was cool..........i'm like "hey those are like the glyph's in ecco!"what does this mean?I, Phosis, Artarus or anyone can have cystals that 'talk'also.........how do the Clan dolphins and those others build?or the clan's spikes and makeup..........the flying dolphins in ToT
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I get the Dreadlord's vision. And I love the wise idea of a music-related board to discuss about  bands and other cool stuff. But in the other hand, that has nothing to do with Ecco (except if the topic is about ecco music, or gets mixed with it). In my point of view, it looks like a great idea in the wrong place, but that depends on how much ecco-exclusive is this place supossed to be.Anyways, I'll sit here and watch what the arkon.com people decides to do.Ah, and about the glitches stuff, CoH has plenty of that, and it kills me of boredom. Anyways, the people keeps posting it. So, maybe they really like it. In  my point of view massive glitch post's are the ultimate in masochism, except if the glitch has some interesting fact on it... (I can remember just 3 or 4 interesting glitches, the rest...).

I have the glyphs 'talk' by reusing the dolphin's own sonar sound waves, reconfigured inside the glyph.Clan dolphins possibly build stuff with slave labor. Or by using technology left behind by man. (ie the harness from man's nightmare or the technology used in the hanging water generator)Their spikes and coloration are the result of genetic engineering and the ranks are printed on like tattoes. Maybe.Sky dolphins are able to fill parts of their bodies with helium. So far, maybe they get the helium by the fusion of hydrogen atoms. (This is the fusion power referred to by scientists that would be better than fission or nuclear power, but is not yet possible)Somewhat related: The the book and movie "Flight of Dragons" dragon flight is explained by the digestion of calcium, which creates hydrogen. It is possible to say that the food the Sky dolphins eat contain more calcium then at present and they obtain hydrogen that way, but that does not explain the step to helium, unless they only said helium in ToT because it is more easily recognized as little than air.

Though the Dolphins would have to have some sort of imune system against helium, as it is poisonous.

Well, I have had some problems lately. My back went out on me two days ago; apparently I have scoliosis. My right vertebrae was pushed, and a muscle torn, and I have had chiropractical work done, and physical therapy. I was not able to sit on the computer for long periods of time, which is why I wasn't seen in Darkseas. I feel a bit better now, though I can still barely sit, and should be able to do some work with Earth Clan tonight. Sorry for the delays.I know what you go through Pho, my mother has the same as did my grandmother before her and possable my too, though not yet.. sorry to hear it.

Of course if it was ecco related. I thought you meant general music. Even then, as doom said, there would not be enough to talk about. "Hey guys, remember the other night when we talked about the welcome to the machine music?" So that really fits in off topic anyways.

Yet it can be done, look at tomb raider, one of the biggest fears they had was that the milions of tomb raider fans would be outraged by the movie not following the game in the finer details, yet it was a success, and even the hardcore fans were pleased with the outcome. It COULD be the same for Ecco......who knows.... all you need is the right team for the job!
</div>

<div id='container'>
never saw tomb raider. never liked the games.

I remember once, years ago, i read a article and seen it on video, some dolphins (dont remember what species) were attacking a pod of porpoises. It was a terrible sight, the poor things flew in the air.  :( Peoole were wondering why the dolphins would do such a thing... anyone else heard of this? I never thought about it until now....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think I have said it before, but I'll say it again. I would really like it if you friendly artists here would make Avatars for me here. I hate to sound bothersome and all, but everyone here has such a good style and I have wondered what my Atolm beast would look like in everyone's own style.

ahhh, so this must be the undercaves I have heard so much about!

I dont think people listen to me anymore around here...i announced it long time ago...Anyways yes that was the Undercaves, unfortunatly the forum isnt there along with amny of the other things that used to be there.

Unfortunately, so far we don't know much. We really need some skilled ROM Hackers here. :) I figured out pretty much every aspect of how messages / text works (how to change the text, add line breaks, or make a new message 'page' pop up), but that's about it. Tails151 is doing well at modifying the graphics via TLP (Tile Layer Pro). A good way to go might be if we all just try modifying some parts of the hex code and see what happens. If one portion glitches out, we know what that code affects, and we can change it effectively once we figure out the format.

Sorry I haven't read past page 1 of this topic as I haven't had time, but here's what I'd think would make a good ecco movie-Has anyone seen "The Bear"? That won a bunch of awards-it portrayed the story through the eyes of a young bear without any dialogue. For my idea of the Ecco movie, the only dialgogue would be through narration or glyphs. The soundtrack would be very important to the movie as it would give the audience the feeling of being "underwater"...that would be amazing in a cinema, don't you think? A mixture of real life and cgi graphics would probably be the best option, but think of the cost of making it!

I remember "the bear". It was a nice movie, and like you say, there was no need of dialogue. But Dolphins are not a little bear, and the cg cost is just unnafordable and unthinkable for a risky project like that. Remember what happened to square with the ff movie.CG are expensive.

...... still reading that "Fire Bringer" book    ..........

Heh, that's what I do, sten. But my problem always was the leak of time.And about the future, I just don't care about it. There's any point in caring of the unknown and unpredictable future?

For that reason, I must enjoy my present.Time flows like a fast river, damnit.

Wow; what an interesting topic !!!I'll try to help too...Let me imagine something...Huumm...*thinks*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I had an ex girlfriend who probably is the reason im the arrogant asshole i am today. I used to like her so much but could never get her to give the same love in return. she used to mess around with other guys alot right in front of me and there was nothing i could do about it. even if i did the guys were always bigger then me and it was always unfair. back then i was more nicer and not so much a jerk but finally i got to the point where i couldnt take it anymore and it was very hard for me to get over her. luckly i got into the internet and found a way to forget about feelings and shit...this place...is what keeps me from getting stressed. as long as im busy with the site i can easily forget feelings that effect me. problem is my solution works to perfectly. i havent even wanted to bother with a girlfriend or friends or relationships after i found a new addiction.the only thing stressing me right now is the fact i have so much work to do and so little time on the net. im hoping i can get my web projects done in time so i can get back to the real world again. my goal is a self updating site. if i can do that which isnt too hard then i will be free from my online prison.

<div id='container'>
Well, DL, I can understand that you're mad at your ex for getting on your case, but I don't think it's right to post her SN. :? I mean, it's kinda like an invasion of privacy, ya know? Plus, I don't think that having a bunch of unknown people IMing her and saying "You suck! You're hurting my friend, stop it!" is the right way to go about this, and it's probably not fair to her. You should try talking with her if you haven't already. There's always a solution to every problem, and with problems like these, talking about it first helps.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, that's what I use, too, but how do you make the water effect? I could never figure it out.
</div>
<br />

heh who gives a damn about her privacy...i have to be honst with you kitnee but not all problems have a solution. i mean they do but sometimes your options arent as open as you think.

CG is indeed expensive.Which is why I still think it should be 50 percent Live action.It would still be a expensive film, but at least it would be very controlled.The Dolphins would be trained, and the CG....well, CG.   Humans would supply the voices.Now, I still think inner monlouge would be best.No mouth-moving. It would not be very realistic, and comedic. Also, flash backs and images can be comunicated, seeing is that's how Animals really comunicate and think (At least, in theory) by colors,and images.The key to success here is the story, based on a dramitised version of ECCO 1. Trust me people, that's the only thing missing from Videogame movies today.Fucking up the story...    :x

Added a bit more in the section. It is in my update on the frontpage, and also on the sidebar under articles now, for your viewing pleasure.Also, we need some order. I beleive atolm had interest in the Vortex? So atolm and me, (with her permission) will work on ideas for that part. Anyone else can contribute as well.I am making an application form. Here is the deal. All that want to contribute, You need to pick a topic. From Glyphs, atlantis, to whatever. Tell me the topic, and I will see if it is suitable. If I think its good, you will vreate ideas, and everything you think of will be posted here. I will edit it, add any pictures or graphs, and place it in the section, with credit to your name!So if you want to help, apply for what you want.

ok Phosis. I'll be more than happy to help! I was thinking about doing some vortex drawings too.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Upon reaching this site, i have been inspired to do my own sort of story. I have talked to some of you about this and some have shared your ideas on what  I should do with this story. As some of you may know, the Atolm beast is not from here and is pretty much a stranger in the sea, anyways, I ws thinking that if anyone wanted to be in the story, since the majority of everyone here has a character. I thought this would be a nice twist to the character theme that we have here. If anyone here has any interests you may either private message me or reply here. All I ask for is your chracter's description, whether good or bad, and reactions toward my character whether it be hostile or kind. Do keep in mind that there will be some ecco themes here like the vortex and Atlantis.if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask.  :D I hope to make a wonderful (and yet bloody, sorry to say) story out of this.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah, yes, I had a GF too.We lived in happy happy rainbow land for a year in a half, with a house only for us and all we needed. It was all fine and smooth, not problems, and not even a single discussion.And for that reason, boredom killed that relation wit the best girl. We decided to take different paths because the old spark was lost. Maybe I'm strange but that's my story.

*crawls out of her shell*I wouldn't mind being in your story.. that is if you don't mind..So you need a profile aye? *types furiously*Name Presumed to be as old as the universe in dolphinic terms - 167 million years old in human (and atlantean) terms. Sex The ability of the spirits. She can light an entire area with a blue aura just with the reptilian scales of what skin shows. She can fire Atlantean bolts, and can stay underwater roughly 7 more minuets that the average dolphin. Description: A mysterious dolphin of the prehistoric era. She was and still is one of the first Atlantean people, with the ability to shape shift from Dolphin to human and back using the power of the glyphs. She is a long dolpihn, roughly the size of Trellia, with long agile pectoral fins of white and mulberry. She has a three-split tail with two long tendrils emerging from the tail. Her body is covered with sleek black fur and instead of a blow hole, she absorbes air through a crest atop her head (for a better look at this, just see my Art gallery and find a pic of her). She has a passionate hate for the vortex kind for killing her family and her people, and is an incredibly strong fighter. She is more than willing to fight to the death for her friends and mate - Zealot. Her first reactions towards the Atolm beast would be hostle, thinking it is something of the Vortex kind - but she learns to trust it and becomes friendly to it.

Name unknownSex A Dolphin. His friend singers nicknamed him the *"Ring Bearer" (for, arround his neck he has a whitish collar).

Ooh! I wanna be in it!Character Approx. 5 History  vortex evolutionary virus/parasite attacks his mother, infects him while still in the womb and twists his dna. Parents, from an outlying atlantean colony flee for atlantis. Vortex drones attack and kill k'shids parents when k'shids mother stops to give birth to him. Vortex drones take him back to earth hive (mistaking him for one of their own) where he grows rapidly, surviving on food destined to go to the queen.Age 1 Atlantis falls. K'shid flees into the future, (between ecco 1 and tides of time)Age 2 K'shid and asterite part amiably.  Age 4 Year long career as an oceangoing eco sabotuer. Believed responsible for the sinking of at least three whaling factory ships.Appearance Silent most of the time. His frightening appearance hides an intelligent mind and a strong sense of justice. Never lets his emotions control him (assuming he has any). Does not bond well with other dolphins. Social cues tend to go over his head. Little ones of all species seem unafraid of him, however. He speaks dolphin, vortex and human languages. Although he fought against them, k'shid believes the vortex weren't entirely evil, merely desperate for food.Reaction to atolm When are we gonna see those drawings atolm? You're such a great drawer, I wanna see my character done by you!
</div>

<div id='container'>
You've seen how I've been working. A question pops up and I toy around with a little science mixed with fiction and something else I think I found under a rock. I do, however, think my glyph explanation was my best, and I can develop it a bit more to explain all glyphs, including those of DotF. Ok, I'm not touching those save glyphs seen ocasionally, but I think I can do the rest, and anything else that needs to be done.

<div id='container'>
I always enjoy seeing my character through the eyes of another.Name I've always assumed 8Sex Bottlenose dolphin. Slighty blue tinted. Four-pronged star on his mellon.Reaction to Atolm He is friendly, though is hesitant to become close with anyone do to his past.Abilities: Is faster than most dolphins, and has the ability to shift to the form of an orca, again with the star. This shifting ability is rarely used due to discomfort.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yes, there have been some reports of Bottlenose dolphins being quite cruel at times.

w00t!! Name orcaAge femaleDescription friendly, but cautiousPersonality Speed is not Kitnee's forte, although she can swim pretty fast for an orca. She's also very smart.  Given the same ability as Ecco to breathe underwater by the Asterite, Kitnee also has a powerful sonar that can blast through rock.

Heh well, Atolm,me and you've talked about my characterName68 Billion years oldSpeciesMaleDescriptionFriendly,Loves to help others,will protect his friends to the death
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*gives Cally a big hug!!*Thank you Cally!  D  That is one exact way i imagined the Atolm beast!Ah, for reference, i am female. It seems that the first question that comes to mind is my gender. Aw well. No worries here.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well I am so happy that many of you folks want to be in this! You can thank Dreadlord for giving me the idea. I will put your personas down and from the looks of it, Cally will be the first one to meet Atolm.  That being because Atolm came to the world before life itself existed, so basically, she has seen the evolution off all species.I would type more info but I am visting at a friend's house and i have class in about a hour, so sorry that i have to keep it short. I'll be back with more info and or questions.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
isn't a billion more than a million? if so that means DreadLords age of 68 billion years old is more than Callyfin's 167 million right? i'm not saying change story i'm also saying callyfin saw evolution of all life except for DreadLord, Dread has been around sice the Dragons ruled earth,and also saw thier fall,and the uprise of every life force,including Callyfin. but DreadLord shouldn't meet Atolm until all the people in the story meet Atolm,and then Atolm will meet DreadLord and he will tell the party everything and how he saw the entire ordeal like atolm reanimation and all. he also points out the evil beings weak spot. Or is it really the weakspot? i'm really bored lol. Atolm i'm just making up shit for tha book so edit or leave it all out if ya want. Personally i like the way I set everything up lol. ttyl on aim ^^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
That is cool looking Cally. I wish I could make my Photoshop do that. *raises point card wih a ten on it*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Our universe is 13 billion years old. Earth is 3 billion years old. A billion is a thousand million.Very simple life may have existed as far back as 1 1/2 billion years ago. Complex multicellular life appears approx. 900 million years ago (the cambrian explosion. reference the ediacarian and burgess shale fossils)The age of dinosaurs came to an end 65 million years ago.The first ancestors of humans (austrolopithecus afarensis sp?) appeared 4 million years ago. Perhaps you should make dreadlord 168 MILLION years old. That would make him born in the early jurassic period.

<div id='container'>
Ah yes, the Blundercaves, and good ol' Smackfin.It had some good points, but it all went down hill when Smacky got with Megz, that whore.But he's shapend up pretty well nowadays, so i got nothin' againts him.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ok, has anyone else seen the movie memento? its probably one of the best movies ive seen (as far as action type movies go)ok, heh, just checking if anyone else had  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
sorry Trellia. I have not seen it. What is it about?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
How do you put screen shots from the tv onto the computer? Sounds of stupid me to ask, but i have always wondered that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
fraid not
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ive never heard of it. Thats impossible. o.o
</div>

<div id='container'>
Ah yes... the undercaves.... only hazzy memories of love, hate, final fantasy fans, cyber sex.How could anyone forget?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Kick ass photoshop effects!!! I love the dark water looking mood. Very effective!It's hard to tell what gender people are over the net! It was handy, on the old board how it had that little symbol so we could tell. Oh well... everyone used to think I was a guy too. ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, they are like humans. Some are just....jerks.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
shame. you don't get to see it then. ;)I don't really have anywhere to upload an image to.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ah yes Dreadlord, the name you seek is Shephuphan, which means a serpant.The prolouge is pretty much done, it is less than two pages long but gives an idea of where Atolm comes from, I plan on sending the proluge along with a cahpter soon.
</div>
<br />

Sounds cool. I'll have to try that sometime. Won't be able to take any screenshots though :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hey Miana, good to see you back. Of course we havent forgot about you, you've been in the ecco community longer then me and Arkon.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Oooo! ^_^ I'd love to be in your story, Atolm! But since I haven't exactly come up with a story for my own character yet, perhaps Noriko could just be a side character? Sort of mysterious, I guess. And also, like Crestoe said, everybody is set on making their characters all powerful and stuff. Noriko isn't powerful. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, of course. You'll understand when I actually get the time to do my story. x_x
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
oooo! i like it cally, i like it a bunches.atolm=female. okay. im glad i was here to catch that.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
WOW ! Cally !It's awesome !...Like usually ^^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*sigh*Despite what has happened, I'm gonna try to do my best in terms of writing and everyone's own characters. Sorry I over looked that fact Dreadlord, but  i was in a hurry and I have plans for the story, so no worries there.Sorry for the delays in drawing everyone, many of you have asked me to do drawings for you and i do have them here, but i have no way of scanning as of yet. Money is tight and i cant go and get a scanner. Plus my birthday is coming up so I am forbidden by my friends from buying things.I am sorry that you do not want to take part of this Crestoe, I hope I have not done anything to offend you and the like. I'll just say this, my beast is not as strong as everyone would think she is, it is more like... I really cant describe it, this is something that all of you would have to read. I think i will try to work on it tonight, prolouge anyway.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think I understand what you're getting at atolm. A creature doesn't have to be all powerful to inspire fear. People in the eccoverse aren't afraid of the asterite despite it being reclusive and powerful. Actually K'Shid isn't very powerful. Sure he can shape shift and go out of water and he's a very skilled fighter but he's far from being a god.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
PS: Hey atolm when are we gonna see those character drawings?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Thank you for your comments - and I'm glad that you like it Atolm ^_^;; Sorry about the gender thing ^^;;; My bad ) But I am very glad you like it :)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ahhh thank you Hedgeghoggy. My beast is nothing more than a pawn of a ancient past that seeks control. I think... I'll let the prolouge explain most of it.*starts to type*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Don't worry about it Cally, I am not at the least bit offended.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hi Miana! ^_^ You don't know me, but welcome back!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
*steps over the fallen Trellius* Hullo, Miana. I have not been on this site for too long, but I welcome you back as well.

Damnit, that's not working alastor. I downloaded a 259 bytes jpg. Must be some type of direct access instead a image.

Eao, I told you that because it was what you wanted to hear. As I know I don't like men.  And even if I were gay, I'll not confess it in a message board.

yay! I can't wait to read how this all comes out ^_^

o__oCool!! I'm sure he'll love it. ^__^She'll love it. Sorry swift,had to point that out.Ack! My bad.....guess I'm just not around as much as I should be..... ~_____~;;;

How about the "geology/geography" of Ecco?I was going to post months (a year?) ago about "where ecco lives and where he went"if they did as much reaserch on ocean fauna for DoTF it'll be easy to find 'Where in the world is ecco san deiego' (bad joke)because in the first game they have Morish Idol fish in the artic.those blue fish in DoTF i think are "blue tangies" I'm not ithieologist so don't take my word for it.Rock formations.  "This rock is commingly found by..."(hoo hum....ecco CD has graphics from ToT and ecco 1 genisis?)I was watching a show on discovery....somwhere by Florida there is one of the worlds deepist trenches, thus in E.T.D when he visits Asterite it says it lives in the deepist part of the ocean (or at least to the mammals..that crunch you get when you go deeper can kill)Atlantis....here is the biggie.  Is it near Greece?  The sculpturs make it look that way (those armless nuddie men) but the runes are like Viking runes...from Scandinavia and such.  DoTF's Atlantis has well..a multycultural influance (some bit of Russian i belive, look at the buildings)DoTF takes place in the same geological area, only in alternate times.Islands of tranqity is always there (somone on CoH asked if it still existed in the nighmare worlds)you go on top of the waterfall in "Up and Down" you go ontop of the water fall in "sleeping forces"so a whole map could be drawn (not to mention a bigassed ultmate sonar map of the whole world...it is connected)I'm not there yet but I speculatie Mustaclone is up there...being called the highst exalted one, Musty musta live as high as Musty's status.Ecco's other games however...take him more places...well in the first game however (although I did see some terra ferma and sea that looked like the bottom/bkg from ToT's watertubes)Ecco becomes a home body...if he gets another game he may not go very far...mabye time hop, but never again to the artic, opean ocean, space and prehistoric past (BTW is it me or was there a Pternadon in H.W?)above and beyond: Look at the sky....the trees and moutains.Look in a picture book of geography whut it look like?The sky and moutains looked vaguly famaliur to me in all ecco Atlantis levels.find those moutains and find ecco's Atlantis!Ecco seemed to have moved house in his games....Atlantis was far far away in the first game, DoTF it was next door, you could say they lived on the outer garden/lawn/coutyard of the place.  Why the move?  bad memiories?  Location location location! (real estate jargon...local is important)so what do you think?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ok...so they may be polygons, but they are decropoged with sprites.those wacky critters of Defender Of The Future.Like my face pic, somtimes a strange thing may occure and the cute, scarry, handsome animals will turn into laughable aquatic abomanation!how is this done?  get your Tv card ready...and your fingers....it's quick!1) find somthing....anything shark or dolphin2) swim around by them alot, it they are stationary your chance is better, if not you may miss your chance and or get hurt.  I said YOU have to swim by them, but in the case of sharks...well you know ;)3) the hard part. You or the object have to "swim through" each other from behind, the camara will read it as the thing being directly behind you so much that it's smack dab in your face (like a wall) if this worked and you got the pic, you should see the frontal view of your object. Laugh, Cry, scream in terror? what ever you like, To highten your chances re-play a level where a dolphin follows you...Like Master of forgoten skills/ Process that never ends, or Trial without error.  let the thing follow your close stop, turn around or swim backwards.  if you don't "bump off" of the object (which you might, after all solid objects cannot go through solid objects) then try again.  'Stationary objects' (like pilot) are best, when you get the frountal face they don't move away.---how do i know?I've missed my chance to digi photograph a clan dolphin and those red eyed sharks (they are ugly) so, this is a 2 person operation which requires fast fingers and extream cooperation (with the TV card, one at the game, other at the card)then well.  You got what the 'curse of 3d graphics' is on "film"it may look "3d" but in the end it's all 'painted on'(like the pillars and curtains in the Sistine Chaple)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I was wondering that too.oh well is this the first time you were though to be male Atlom?every internet community i go to think's I'm male.I guess we have to act more girly or gave a boob with a face painted on it as our advtars.

Well I'd love to say I'm back, but I'm only making this one post.  The reason I've been gone so long has nothing to do with that game I talked about (when I said I might be around less often), in fact I've hardly played it.  The reason I've been gone all this time is simple: college.  This is my first year at college, and I don't have as much free time as I did last year.Also, when I do have free time, there are several things that I like to do more than posting messages at a forum.  It's not that I don't like anybody here, it's just that there are other things that I like to do with my time.I just wanted to say something in case I'm not around for a very long time.  I don't want anyone to think I'm ditching you all or anything.I may not see any replies to this message, at least not for some time.  So if you have anything you want to say to me I would encourage you to e-mail me (there should be a little envelope icon under my avatar).Oh, and since everyone missed it, I turned 19 on Sep. 7.  In case anyone cares.

hi there duo, I'm Delphineus. I've been here for months but have never had the opportunity to get on to this forum for ages and ages.  I'm a British lassie and i originally came from yorkshire but have lived in Kirkcudbright (scotland) for approx ten years with my family.  I think i'm the only person from Britain on this forum but i'm not sure.  Anyway i give you a warm welcome.  I'M not surprised if you've never heard of Kirkcudbright,not many have. I f you are wondering where it's located it is near the boundary line of scotland and england on the south west coast of scotland.

there is a thing to buy, you install it into your computer and hook it up to the TV/VCR/vidiogame consoul.you then "turn on your new tv" (open program) and it should act like a real TV, only with a pause and screen shot option(make trading cards of TV newscasters)and oh....record!  for this here you'll need a fast and trusting helper at the computer to take your pics when you play.WinTV is one card, I got mine at Staples.and they aren't 500 dollars.  like 60 or 30 bucks.  I forgot though how much...but cheeper and more legal than I first thought.but those recorded files are huge. You'll need to convert them into realplayer files...this will inable you to make things like music vidios.or use a digi camara

Hey, I remember you! I looked at the member list recently, and you were one I wondered about. Rest assured, you are not the only one from Britain here, but I'm not sure where they all went. And unless you are Crimson, there is someone else signed up from Kirkcudbright as well.

Actually if you were clever enough you could creatively intrigate them into a comic, with a REAL story of COURSE, but with these little things happening as well...it's not impossible. Also work piling on? You can always find time to do stuff you really want to. It's not an excuse to be delayed.

Sten, I'd love to help,but Keiko might not make it on his own,he won't perform,I don't see why they won't build him his biig cage out in the ocean where they can watch over him,and he can be free also.... :(

<br />

<div id='container'>
callys the only whos seen it? well, go rent it. its really goodits about this guy who has this problem that he cant make new memories, and hes trying to have revenge on this man supposedly named john G who raped and murdered his wife. and so...the really confusing/cool part of the movie is that it goes backwards, so your put in the main characters spot, not know what happened a few minutes before.i cant relly give it enuf credit, you gotta see it yourself :D

Keiko might not not make it on his own to live by himself. I think people should build him a larged fenced area in the ocean,where they can watch and feed him.

just for record, could you make up some stats such as age,gender,species,powers(if any),personality
</div>

<div id='container'>
Well, I see atolm every night in chat... But okay.Age Absolutely nothing,Personality Of course, Phosis.Appearence: A very plain bottlenose. No distinguishing marks. Very odd, but thats how it was meant to be.

so what? it isn't an excuse. it's called time management. get the "important" things done first and the others later, but if you do it correctly you can actually finish them at around the same time.

just to be fair to everyone here, i might as well explain what the hell Atolm is. Some people like Dreadlord and Phosis already know, but im gonna brief this up.Atolm is a beast who is not even from this world. She wakes up on a strange planet whose life is barely forming, its earth of course. She tries to make sense of the world about, and she is very confused about why there is only one of her. As the story progresses, she becomes aware of the lust of battle that is withinn her and this troubles her greatly. Another thing that confuses her is hearing dolphin songs, it makes her very nostaligic and troubled at the same time for she cannot grasp the song's meaning.Atolm is trying to discover who the heck she is, at the same time, she will meet other creatures, whether they be friend or foe and they shall be the ones who will help her ultimatly find out who she is.She has no special attacks, just the pure instinct of primal battle. That may change though.Sorry if the information is so little, but the prolouge should explain more of her background. Now if only i could finish it up and send it here soon. grrrr

I dont know exactly what you propose to do. it seems interesting, but a little enigmatic.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well if you consider the runes found in Atlantis, it would be located near Norway or something like that. But then again, i dunno....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Calm down buddy. o.o
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Take your time,Atolm.  No one wants a crappy, poorly written, rushed through story, so take your time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Maybe, it's no set location.  Like the Drifting Oasis in Dragon Ball(yeah i know stupic comparison). the folks who made up ecco's world probably spent so much time developing his world and kinda disregarded where his exact location is.but then again i could always find out exactly where he is in all the games..
</div>

See? What did I tell ya? Talk first, act upon that. She had a reason to be acting weird, and her being manipualted by this new guy was it, I'm guessing.

i wish somone loved me that much.My childhood friend says he has to kill me....spirtual intervention helped out by prophacy dreams says 'yes'.  His friends and girlfriend help and support his "destiney"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
my flash skills suck very much as of now.I may change it to a "pick things up go" game with "bosses" at each level's end (hench the race)the story will be ecco is looking for the lost tressure of delphinus(last contestant)Del will give ecco "said tressure" if he wins the race and 'lives' through said adventure.

Rrmf, editing SNES graphics ain't a walk in the park either. X_X But at least by using the E2B palette I get shades of blue and gray as opposed to funky psychodelic colors.

Urg...I just cannot figure out how to edit sprites, even with TileLayerPro. Well, I mean I can change the sprite, but the color is all screwed up. X_x How can I fix it so the changed sprite is the colors that I want it?

Rainbows are beautiful, eao. ^_^I like rainbows !!! All the gradation of colors are beautiful.That's why my character has rainbow colored eyes, and gradation from red to yellow on her fins  :)

Point in fact Eo, Atlantis has actualy been found, well the ruins anyway, on a small volcanic island  a few miles off the coast of Crete.

</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ok....so as i said ecco must of went from..uh.......californa? up to the artic, down to the caraibain or somthing....the indies then to meditarianiaing.if there is a deeper trench than the one near flordia.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I dunno Eao....Eccos world seemed to be a different kind of world then portrayed in ecco. Like an alternate earth. I think some elements like that need to be kept sacred. But thats just my opionon.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
besides being a cheep ripoff of the Vortex, are you going to do an evaliuation of the Foe?the teeth on the queen look like she won't be able to "eat"as would a dog...or even an allagator.and how, a mammale configured it's self to "breath water"
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I had always had it in mind that this was based on ecco 1 and 2...The REAL eccos. To me, dotf was just a cheap ripoff that used the ecco name. not to mention it was a poorly made, average game.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
how about. for the page it's self we reawaken the dead undercave "humor" section.that was done with me......hell I was the one with the"you know you played too much ecco when"/you know you're an ecco fan when" thing.and the name paryodies.unless we let CoH take that.  seeing how we're friends now
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
shame though...if Ed worked on it, it's pretty ness won't end at visuals.i'm in seeds of posion now...I got the game on august 27th or somthing.(damn i got free time)
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
save for the tropical fish in the artic.I still think at least one real place would be cool.at least ecco went globe hopping....in DotF he's a homebody."up and down" and "seeds of posion" seem the same to me.not to mention "Mutaclone('s lair)" and "sleeping forces of doom" are in the same placea close examination of sonar maps could also tell where else Ecco revisits at differnt times.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I doubt arkon is going to let coh take anything that we make up. the sites have an alliance, but why would we share sections with them? Anyways, a good idea. I will see whta I can do about that one, and get back to you on it.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah. true dat. Now ed is reduced to making games like tiny tank. *tsk tsk tsk*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
llook back at the undercave archives.But i want to alter my "level name paridoies"at the time i had no DotF knowlage and was brazin to paryodie every level.

<div id='container'>
if it weren't for the "adoption" of the "diversity" (gay pride flag) of rainbowi'd make more rainbow colored thing.funny how they will use a rainbow then they are attracted to the same sex..homo meaining "same" or even..and a rainbow, having "7 colors"

Yeah,he's so used to peoples care. :(

I was just wondering...when any of you folks are writing, or drawing, to you accompany it, or write or draw to music? I know that when I write time strider, I always listen to music, usually hard rock. I was just wondering if any one else does
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I do Phosis! but then you already knew that!I usually listen to whatever inspires me to write and draw, and that can be from video game sound tracks (ecco songs of time) to hard rock like Apocalyptica.  :D
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
While the Vortex queen did indeed have large fangs, there are some sea creatures whose fangs are very huge, of course these fellas live deep in the sea, cant remember their names at the moment though....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
listening to Rammstein inspires me to write
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
When I draw, I almost always listen to some sort of Japanese music, whether it's traditional, anime, or J-pop.

How nasty, I have never experienced any problems with swimwear *coughs* but I o have knee and backproblems. My back problems persit even today - but a nice soak in a hot bath, with lavinder and rose helps alot. My knee has been out of it since I fell down the stairs at school - and that hurt like a bitch. I was unable to walk properly for a month, so for a month I hobbled, gave myself an internal hemorage - and they wouldn't even give me a lift key *snorts* Heh, but we're all glad that your feeling better ^^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Heh heh. I'm glad I wear contacts. Although it's probably not too smart to wear them in the ocean. 8O I got saltwater in my eye once when I had my contacts in - it burned like hell. XPSame happened to me once. Once, when I was swimming, I oppened my eyes underwater and my eyes were hurting like hell for a good while. So, now I almost never go w/out my goggles.Also, once I got caught by a big wave, and swallowed a mouthfull of saltwater (I'm not a good swimmer  ... &gt;Dies&lt;  .)

Well Eao, I know your story involves the various Atlantis locations, so this may be of interest to you, and anyone else curious about Atlantis.Lemuria, or Mu, is said to have been an ancient continent in the Pacific Ocean, somewhere between America and Australia/Asia. It was populated by an advanced civilization before and during the time of Atlantis, predating all other civilizations. In comparison, Atlantis was more scientifically based while those of Lemuria were more spiritual. It is said that Lemuria began to sink amoung the rising waves, and it's people took refuge on its mountains. In 1931 an American writer by the name of Wishar Cerve thought that the remains of Lemuria colided with America in California, becoming Mt. Shasta in the Cascades. This idea has brought forth a religion of people who believe the Lemurians were a superior race that live in a gold-lined city within the mountain and emerge occasionally wearing white robes and trade for supplies.I have only done a little research on the topic, but it won't take long to find something on a search engine. There are also people who believe that the Lemurians came from another planet and others, like I said, believe they are gods.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I'm thinking along the same lines as Eao. The problem is, Orcas aren't meant to be domesticated, and Keiko is now a victim of shortsightedness. They didn't take care of him in captivity, and they can't just erase what has happend to him. I don't know what the best solution is. But if people cared enough to release him in the first place, I do not think they can put him down. You'd have a lot of angry people out there.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I know I've written homework to music. Haven't tried any of my real writing though. I think I'm missing out on something, so I'll have to try it next time. I know music has inspired some of my ideas, and this may be all that's required for me to reignite my interest again.

Thanks, i was going to re-ask about other places.not all have to be "underwater" Eao is granted powers of shapeshifting(when i get to writing i'll have her eat somone's dog who jumped overboard, so she'll have a land animal to turn into) Space huh?  sence some belived them to come from another planet I suppose I can have the "space orb" come from there.  it allows the "lotus" to also become a transporter to distant places....the "time orb" does time and "place" allows for "dimentional travel" (you stay 'home' but go to a differnt dimention that is located ontop of 'home')eer.....I'l have to save your post when i get home.also was it me or did i see a "teaser" for a show on sunken pyramids around Japan?  anywho i'll set eao's tale in um....60 or so years in the future, by then China whould of completly flooded there famous great 4 corners gorge although it may even be complete by 2005 anthropoligists must work fast because there are old 'tombes' in the sides of these clifs, and many intreting history will be lost (I'll have some magic artifact from from here for the "lotus")  China must flood this scaraced, famous place to make the world's largest man made lake, it will be used for cheep, efficent clean hydro energy.  but to lose a scaraced tressure and history.  Thats a scaracfice.  Ah....Discovery channel...witout you I watch cartoons or comidey central.anyway i guess i can re-ward you with a face pic?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
when i draw in photoshop, i'll wear my head phones but nothing comes out...so then it's back to randome, interesting stuff on TV( cartoon network, animal planet, comidey channle, somthing good)it's funny when people see me with the computer headphones "what are you listning to?"i say"nothing now, but they keep my ears warm"  must be tat do play an mp3 and use photoshop will slow down "mr. computer" so mabye a midi? or nothing.ecco music may help me draw ecco pics.  Then i can use an mp3 for ms paint.  noting will move like it's coverd in glue.  or as i say, a nice sounding midi.I'm uh musicly modest and fearfull of being laughed at.  thats it's stupidly cute i like a song and they'd rag on me about it. thats why i forcefully sway from ones with lyrics.
</div>

<div id='container'>
tatoo requests are common from me, maybe i should get into the bussiness....the site does have pretty pictures.does anybosy here sell stuff online, as a small little bussiness or something? just curious....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
it is a no win situaton if you ask me. That poor orca has gone through so much, even if he is realeased back ito the wild, he may not be able to survive and if you allow him to stay in captivity, that would make many people angry. There is not really a solution here.
</div>

same here. i pretty much come here late at night or early in the mornings. that is, when i dont have work or school.I know how you feel Noriko, school  and work does take up your time.

<div id='container'>
I share your pain in that regard then friend, and yes, naturally did I recognize Alucard, he is my favourate CV character! ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well.....slipping while swinging from the light fixture helps! *joke*

<div id='container'>
But HE is the but-licker whe starts it in the first place by getting him there.

<div id='container'>
True dat.

<div id='container'>
Thanks, guys! Right now is actually one of the rare moments I have spare time, as little as it may be. But hey! I've got the weekends. w00t. ^_~ No doubt you'll see me around on a weekend or two during the month.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I think of Jerry Springer and then i tell myself that there are people who has a worser life than me.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
hell yeah! Alucard is awesome. Did you know that his name spelled backwards is Dracula? You would be amazed on how many people did not notice that!
</div>

As i was looking at my School's annual used booksale, i came across "Startide rising" and the "uplift war" all in one hard bound book, so i decided to get it. It only costed me a dollar and it has the orginal cover and all. So why not, i got it because some of you guys suggested it.
</div>

<div id='container'>
SPAO lives, I just recieved Neo's book from Ambie :D *is super happy* heh, I think nothing is left of the packaging... *mischevious smile*So, while i'm on topic, how are all the other members of SPAO going? I know that Trellia and Ambie now both don't have books.. ^^

<div id='container'>
*blinks*What are you talking about? I'm lost.  :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
On the topic of Atlantis as one of the locations - I think that in the games it was somewhere along the arctic oceans, or perhaps Iceland - as it has those "leopard spot" sharks in the very first Atlantis level. Which suggests that the waters are most likely cooler.I hate how so many people link atlantis to Greece...
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>

I always write to music. And I do mean always, unless it's really late at night and I don't feel like finding headphones to keep it quiet for my parents (who go to bed hours before I do).The type depends on what I'm trying to write. When I write my Ecco fics it's always either the Songs of Time CD or the DotF Soundtrack, or... well, my nature CDs. If I'm writing something a bit... morbid or depressing it's like... a certain few Delerium songs. If it's something like happy and generally normal, it's usually whatever I happen to have in Winamp. If I'm trying to be cool and have like a nice spirit-ey story goin' on then it's usually Delerium again.Yeah, I love Delerium. They're my writing buddies. And lately I seem to study to music a lot more.

It's an art thingie a few good artists are doing sending sketch books across the world to each other, and then they draw in it and send it onto the next person until it returns home.

<div id='container'>
Oh yeah, I read about that, just like that island that gets larger by 100 KM every year due to volcanic activity.

<div id='container'>
Yeah... can I ask what SPAO stands for?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yup, computer problems are all too common on my end. Nothing as serious as what's going on with you for a fwe months, though. I'd guess it's about time for my computer to fall apart again. :?

The PC actually rules over any console possible. True. The PC never dies. The novelty sized doorstop-er I mean the Gates Machine is just...erm...poo.PS2 is very nice, but showing it's age slighty...nethertheless, delicious games are scheduled. And the cube really takes the biscuit-but it will never live up high in PC city.

This isn't about the beta version, but it could still relate to a pre-release. I have an odd Ecco 2 Genesis/MD ROM that I found, ironically, when looking for a normal one to compare the Beta to. Here's what's different about it a PAUSE sprite in the center of the screen (instead of rotating, blinking status bars) when paused, and the logo appears in the fashion it does in the Japanese version.I used SEGATOOL to compare this ROM file with the US and Japanese versions, and the number of differences was tremendous. The resulting IPS patch file was 1.6 MB!Does anyone know what this ROM is?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Its an odd "beta 2" rom. I know because I have it as well. Looks like something that got sent for code testing or such.
</div>

<div id='container'>
I wanna play the RE remake SOOOOOOOOOO badly....... but I'll never really be able to. Eh. Well, I got my Code Veronica and the 2nd RE, so I'm good.

<div id='container'>
Hmmmm...interesting...how many more could be out there I wonder....

I still have Vantid's sketchbook. As well as my own. Sadly, my serious finnancial problems have forced me to wait a while longer that I wanted to before sending it to Neo'.

About the Keiko's euthanasia thing, I wrote to the Norvegian Ministry of Fisheries.This is what I said them1) This orca eats fishes, so he "makes the country to lose money"2) He can't eat in the ocean3) He can't go with the other orcas4) He always return to men5) To cure him, feed him, etc. is expensive.So, I'll answer these comments you're born in a "civilizated" world, with cars,electricity, etc.If, tomorrow, I put you in the jungle without food, fire, and all youuse in "your" world, you'll be lost, right ?You'll feel alone, and want to reach a town. You'll be really scared.It's the same thing with Keiko.He's a complex creature, and it's the reason for which to set him freeis so difficult.Please accord to him time.Douchk@ "There answer was//odin.dep.no/ud/engelsk/publ/veiledninger/032005-991009/index-dok000-b-n-a.htmlRegards     Hege HelleMinistry of Fisheries "So, you see, they WON'T KILL Keiko !Don't worry about it !
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, I admit that the Foe really made little sense. Why Brin really couldn't use the Vortex, I dunno.    Especally since I believe all the Eccos are connected, including Ecco DOTF and the older Ecco series. So for me, it's hard to come with a reason why there are TWO alien races taking over Earth.  8O
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Hmmm.....sems people in general are ailed allot more these days, or indeed these senturies, are we becomming sicker as time moves on?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Eh...not necessarily...they just may have given you that answer to please you. They still may kill him. They may just be giving everyone who signs the petition those e-mails to make the people think they won't kill him. Hence the reason why the letter beginswith "Dear sir/madam," You already told them you were a girl, Sten. That heading alone makes me suspicious. If they were really giving a straight answer, I think they would have put "Dear madam."*shrugs* But who knows? I could be wrong; it's happened many times before.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well maybe they ARE one and the same, Ecco screwing around with time could have coused them to evolve difourantly. :?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Perhaps, but would they dare? Even if the petition was sent under false pretence now that they had said this they could not kill Keiko without having the proverbial "angry mob" at their doorstep, all the people who recieved this letter would also be able to wave that in their faces....no I dont think they will kill Keiko...though one never knows. As for the "dear sir/madam" I think they get ALLOT of mail quite like Stel's and are handling the replies in bulk, that is why there is no personalization even if she did state she was female.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
As for the "dear sir/madam" I think they get ALLOT of mail quite like Stel's and are handling the replies in bulk, that is why there is no personalization even if she did state she was female.Yes, it's exactly what I think.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ehh.....sorry never heard of it wouldnt something like PhotoShop work? And also I notice it says something about "Globes" by your avatar, what is that?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Im right...? I mean uh.....yes! Of course Im right! 
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
One simple reason for a name change is simply this: vortex is an actual word, (They actually refer to 'vortexes' in Chance of Reckoning which may be a tie-in to the original) , and it would make little sence for an alien race to use it. Therefore, when DotF came around with more of a background story behind the game, it was probably changed to fit better. Keep in mind, the aliens may not call themselves 'Foe,' but is simply a term used to describe them.I've been trying to think of a way to connect the three Ecco games smoothly, and there are some parts I can do it do, and some parts I can't. Yet.I tend to digress.I would remove some of those walls in Hanging Waters, I quess. They really bug me in that part after Ice and Fire. Most of the rest of the stuff that bugs me I think makes it more enjoyable to beat.

I bought sega smash pack for gba today...and let me tell ya...it is the most horribly peice of crap I have ever bought. Someone packaged dog shit, and put a sega label on it. Whats bad? Ecco. As far as I have played, to the undercaves, wanna know how many songs I have heard? 1. 1 fucking song repeating itself through the entire fucking game. It is that song from the ice zone, and I have come to despise it. Thq, I hate you. You raped an awesome game, made it into crap. Okay, my rant about the music is over. Another problem with it, is the message screen. Remember when a message popped up, you got that cool watery screen? Hey, guess what? Thats right! Thq took that apart, too! Hooray for thq! Thq must spell "Shit" All of a sudden, because thats all I have ever played of there products. Now, what about the good points? well, the graphics are the same, but glitchy....Wait, thats not very good. Okay, here is an actual god point. When you die, you get a choice; continue level, or restart level. But since what I have seen so far in the "continue" option, it only lets you restart about 5 INCHES into the level. Another gang raping by thq's programming thugs. Bottom line: Unless I have received some horribly malfunctioning version of the smash pack, this game sucks, and I urge you all not to buy it. Those who have, suicide is an option, and one I am contemplating right now. Or, you could just take the game back...whatever one suits your fancy.*Hangs himself*
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
damn so then the dumper of the game made it ture.i guess I should cancle the down load huh?that means only 1 thing.the illegale pirats must fix the rom and make it better!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i still think they were hastly put in to make it "ferosis" and not to be usefull"hey heres an idea, lets make somthing look scarrier by putting huge ass teeth in the mouth"the foe has a body, apperantly the Vortex has none....or atleast a mechanical one...*shudders*ecco the dolphin 4, level name-"the colen/spleen/kidney"I think ecco is some kinda sadistic doctor....he goes into stomachs (voraphile?) and heart chambers....pokes out eyes and stabs everything with his snout.why can't there be a powers of everything in Heart of foe!oh never minde me....
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ugh. Ecco and dotf are not connected in any way. i dont see how this is not plainly obvious to anyone. They could have made ecco dotf without using ecco as the star, and it would have been the same. But of course, anyone who likes a trademark buys the product, even if it is as crappy as dotf was.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah. I've decided to leave Arkonviox.com for what will be, most likely, permanently. I don't feel as welcomed by Arkon and Crestoe as I used to, and its no point hanigng around anyway... i'd just be taking up space. If any of you guys wanna keep in contact with me, my e-mail is callyfin@broken.orgI'll miss ya...

Why the hell are you leaving?? You have contributed a lot. everyone here will miss you sorely, im sure
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
we made you a face pict cally and done lots for you. i even offered to host your site and more and made you an email account and you name it. but sometimes cally i feel like im being taken advantage of. you know it kinda made me sick that you had to open two sites and abandon the one you had hosted with me. i pay alot of money for that space and i was so sure youd use it and actualy do soemthing good with it but you didnt. i even made you your own forum at one time had you a moderator for my site you name it.maybe i did screw up by not laying out any ground rules for you. the scans for example you did collect for me a while back and i told you i couldnt use them cause they were from psys site. then later on when the new scans section opened you put them up anyways without thinking of what i told you before. but i have looked at them and quite possibly they arent the same. i still question it and funny to say the scans are still up even though you cant see them i still have to moderate them.Im pissed off with you, if crest was here i know what he would call you...he'd call you a fucking sellout...your just like dolphingirl, coral and all of my other so called friends who left my site. well you know what? fuck you all. i may have not been a great friend but if you were ever threatened by me at least you could do was understand im going under alot of stress holding this site together and i at least tried to keep people around.when the undercaves closed i tried to bring together everyone who fell into its demise like spiffy swift current even people who hated my guts.i even managed to get silverfin to hang out with us, people who left cause they felt left out i tried to keep here. now if you look at it everyone is trying to fade off into a catyclismic downturn. but the way i see it is everyone who leaves will be replaced anyways.but you know what? i still havent forgotten all those i used to call friends.dolphingirl, coral, buddy, you, everyone else who left...fuck you all...you can go commit suicide for all i care. i thought you were my friend cally...i didnt ban you after we fought. i let you stay and i didnt say a word after i seen you came back. because i wasnt mad at you...i was just waiting until i could relax a bit. but screw it. leave. i tried and a failed. now im just giving you a reason not to stay.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What? And I am just settling here too.  :( I am still including you in my story if you don't mind, I may e-mail it to you if you do not mind. Anyways, whatever your reasons for leaving in none of my bussiness, but i would of have really liked to known you.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I would have really liked to seen the Vortex in this game. I remember about first reading about the DOTF game, i was wondering who the hell was the FOE?Too bad that there were no Vortex in this game, I would have really liked to see their Machine level in this sort of game.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Ouch.   8O And to think that I was going to get one when I get my GBA soon. I think I'll stick to the Castlevania games then.

<div id='container'>
Fuck it Arkon, just fuck it! It seems that everything I do for this site gets thrown back in my face with a poor excuse of "it's psy's" *snarls* I am very fed up with this Arkon, and you know it. So you can shove your fucking website nd its shit up your ass, I am sick of this - farewell.

Well, people what are we doing still in this topic? Callyfin said what she had to say,and,it's a shame she has decided to leave this divine place.Now anyway,we cannot dwell on the past!! We must move onward, Arkon is right,those who leave shall be replaced.Now enough with our dwelling on her leaving,we are still a mighty and proud community!! Onward we shall go,and i'll be damned if we let anyone even an ex-member who was greatly loved by many,stand in our way!!

*Glares at Callyfin with his grey eyes* that was quite a dirty trick...here's an even dirtier trick THQ released Ecco1 on GBA  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
open ocene 2 is in it.....thats goofd?my emulated version only has the time warp music playing.i have images up to the tube7-9 o clock.damn I can do better than to get to there in that time.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
huh?go and leave if ya truelly want. joke or not.we should play Gryph Gild and ban ya cuz thats what good people do.can i have her MB?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
ever want to relive the Genisis/sega cd classic?  But you've played it so many times it's new suprizes are as gone as the dinosaurs?here are two ways to play the first ecco (tides of time could do it too)1) kamakazi ecco/speed of lightPlay ecco, with no cheat code at all and do not die (somhow i did this with the genisis version) No save states if emulated, no infinate health or tricks like so.3) Ultmate ecco!:combine 1 and 2.  then you are the ultmate ecco 1 player if you make it.now, any shortcuts are allowed (ie the one in darkwater and bay of medussas)as for ToT....thats harder to do Kamakazi or Immortal (kamakazi easyier)DotF Impossible!so enjoy...

<div id='container'>
Yeah. I would remove the fucking lagoon. That level was way to hard.Yeah, "The Lagoon" is one of the levels I hate the most in the Ecco games.I always die  1 or 2 times when I do this level without cheats.To answer Hazard's question, I wanted to eleminate this level, the arctic levels of "Ecco 1", and most of the Foe's territory levels in DotF.

<div id='container'>
no worries Sten. haha  :D

those artic levels bring a lot of bad memories, especially the ice zone. damn blocks of ice. I always got crushed. and then there were those damn crabs...

The time machine music thing is not a glitch. I went into the debug in the GBA game, and saw that, yes, there is only one song through the whole game.

<div id='container'>
No, dread, It is? I didnt know, since I only payed 40 fucking dollars for the game. Oh well. if you want to discuss ecco 1, go into off topic. I made a nice statement there.Anyways, Godammit. Arkon is always the trickster.

<br />

<div id='container'>
That was a joke?! Geez man... I thought you guys were serious! That was so.... not funny. @_@ I don't want anymore peopel ditching this place like they have been. It's been falling down a little around here.And besides... Arkon fights with everyone! We'd all be gone if that was the reason. ^_-

Hey Eao, could you email me a copy of the ROM? I've been searching everywhere and Ic anna find it, or at least a URL to get it D But hey, if if has Open Ocean two, that means it'll have the Stomach (hopefully!)

<div id='container'>
Afraid not cally. I dont think it has open ocean 2....But i havent checked. Maybe it does? But the stomach is definitely not there.

Damn them, they can't get off they're arses and add a few levels? x.x;;

I don't see "jaxx black fox is my soul sib" in anyone's sig........or LJ.

My life isn't full of enough strife to morn over.I don't hold back.i've seen others say mean things.  but it goes by.because i think it's retarted to Pray for somone who "broke uo but are still terrific friends"to cry because "mommy won't let your 12 yr old buddy get tatooed and periced and marry there 25 yr old OL lover"?i had sadness, I have alliments (I have neurofibromatosis, one day nurofibromid's -could- grow on my spine...but thats nothing compared to sexual disfunction...and not as bad as cancer.)I was at the guild from "ITW" days

(2 Phosis)And what did you expect?  x . So I think it was... predictable, you know. The only company who  really has an experience in making Ecco games is SEGA-Appaloosa tandem. All others just want us - Ecco fans - to give them our money for nothing!   Okay, Enough rude remarks. Moduvator out.

A Oekaki or whatever borad thing would be aight to have considering that our site mostly consists of talented artists anyways, we might as well.But we'll have to see what Arkon thinks first.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Holy shiat, man... that is some awesome stuff!!!I gotta ask you Cal... have you ever considered doing comic book art, or pro cartooning and stuff? Cause you've developed a really wicked, unique style, and your coloring looks very high quality, marker and CG! I also have to ask what you use for inking? Cause it look rad!But seriously! You've gotten an awesome, unique style, and I think it looks very professional. I can just see that heads at OniPress dieing over that look! I totally love it myself!!! Even though I also havent seen Invader Zim.... the style you have is just intriguing, to me! Reminds me a lot of a favorite artist of mine, Brain OMalley.The pictures all rule Cal! The style, inking, and coloring all look wicked!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Do you need a tablet for that?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Good choice. I got it cause i dont like emulators, and it is still fun to see ecco on a small screen. I never listen to in game music anyways, so to me, it doesnt matter. it still is a big deal, though...And yes, Open ocean 2 is there...jus beat it today
</div>

<div id='container'>
No you dont. It is like MSPaint online

Yeah. *huggles everyone* ^^  Actually Crestoe I think you were around longer than me, or was it Arkon? I think it was Arkon because he replied to my first post within the Ecco community.

ahhhhhhh. ok :)

i mentioned it.just don't "fag" it up with Gryph guild 'gods'Lux has got enough people drawing her, and she isn't 'so special'there are a lot of chubby, boyfriended, suicidal christains.there is nothing special about her there are more saintly folks than she.

read my "new ways to play ecco" post Lizza, and you'll see.from 7:30 ish to 9 o clock i went from start to tube.today i spent a long time from tube to last fight.my emulated game might be messed up, but after fighting the queen (anyway you die you go back to the hard Machine, 'ecpt for swallowing)and then the dolphins flew out...but i get warped to "the last fight" (again?) with tital screen and PW)damn
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
why GBA's ecco is vowless is beyond me. so words mean nothing, because all other "pass word words" had vowuls.so here it is-??!!??- that will bring you to southren open ocean.regardless.now who's up for finding more

<div id='container'>
Dont bother. I am giving all the passwords out tonight in an update. I also figured out the debug cheat for this version as well.

I mean microsoft just stuck a Computer CPU into a black box that can be hooked up to ur TV, graphics are exact to new age computers, but all u can do is play games on it. Wouldnt it be more worthwhile to buy a god computer?

<div id='container'>
The style is a mesh of my own and a bit of the square dimention work in the Cartoon it's self D I learnt to colour with them from my grandma - the whole like technique x.xMy inking pens consist of) Ah, my secrets are out DHeh, out of all those - myfavorites would have to be the colour version of her and her irken shadow - and her coloured profiel pic ) As I love both :D I am also going to start my own online Invader Zim fan comic with Lilo in it. So yay!

See, im signed up to the planet age of empire boards...the place is sooo serious,  post like this would be concidered spam. I try and brighten up the place by using smilies, but they have the most droll smilies...all they have is smile and sad. Please post all the smilies and small animations u can in this post.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
It has a dvd and an HD. If worthwhile means your willing to spend about a thousand bucks more, then sure. But for me, I seriously dont give a fuck. Any system is a good system, just for different games. I like some games on Xbox, so I dont think it is crap. I like games on nintendo and ps2 as well, so i cant say they are crap. All this console war bullshit is really gay. "Wahh, My console is better then yours." Who really gives two shits? Same shit, different pile.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Well, with a glitch like that, there might not be a stomach - which is a shame, as it added and extra bit of freakiness to the Queen in the Japanese games.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Damn. I wish they would give the queen a smiling face, and anime style eyes. (For those that are uninformed, something like this. ^_^ ) Because that thing is too freaky in my opinion. I have a wierd thing about it where I cant even play that godamn level anymore. I have seen the queen a thousand million times, and every time, it gets freakier. Imagining being a dolphin, and getting sucked into a giant bug-like organism, only to find out it is half fuckin machine, does not bode well for me. I hope their is no stomach; I dont mind playing the machine a few times.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
lol D But I tihnk the reason she is half machine is that she is the machine it's self, a designed killing and storage machine. When you "kill" her, and the hive + the machine starts to go kablewie because she becomes detached from it - like a failsafe system :D she jetisons herself out of the dying machine into the warp field and down the water tube into earth. Damned THQ... give us stomach!
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Theyd better. Ed would be spinning in his grave...Even though hes not dead...He would STILL be spinning somewhere.*Spits out soda* Pfftt hahaha!    Don't do that while I'm drinking.   :)

<div id='container'>
Well, seriously. this topic was discussed on COH already. And like i said, no one cares...and if they do care, they shouldnt.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Exactly! Dont bash the console just because of where it comes from. It is the games that matter.I would like to get a ps2 for certain games, even a gamecube, but since the x-box is the only console to realease Panzer Dragoon Orta, I am going to get that console.It is my love for the game that determines what system I shall get.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
An Oekaki would kick the llamas arse! *dances* I hope we can get one ^_^
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
What are you guys talking about? I think the queen is awesome looking. A bit scary at first, but you get use to it. I love her fangs! Maybe I am just a tad bit crazy, but oh well!Man, i have yet to play any of the emulated eccos, but i should try them out, especially with this stomach level.

As I have told most of you, that since I dont have a scanner, my art will take awhile to come in. Well, now they are starting to come in. The problem is that they are coming in randomingly and this time i got only two.So without further waiting, i shall use this topic to let people know that the drawings they requested are up. Keep in mind that i have done more than one version of all who asked, since i enjoy doing such things. I am also still taking requests if anyone is still interested.Anyways, the first two drawings that came in is of Arkonviox (pencil) and the other one is of Dreadlord (color).tell me what you all think too.  http://arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album18&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.phpwhat a long address.....

<div id='container'>
face it microsoft owns you and you cant do nothnig about it. as a programmer once you learn how windows works on the inside you begin to appreciate it more. i might have people disagree but i believe even though the os is crap its actualy an underated workl of art. besides monopoly means a standard. if there was no microsoft we all would be using computers ran by different os's much like how we play video games and having to buy this system cause it can do this and that system can it can do that. to be honest we got too many systems thats why monopoly can be cool sometimes. yeah yeah microsoft sucks but no matter how much you trie to aviod it (like people who use linux and mac) you cant aviod it cause if you do you will find you will be forced to use ti again =)

The X-Box is a poor excuse for making a doorstop.What's the point of making a PC console? I use my PC for a more relaxed, in depth experience, but use my gamecube for instant fun and huddling around the TV with a couple of mates, ploughing them in to ground in super smash bros melee! Attempting to blend the PC and console together is just like imitation brillos...you know the rest.  :D PS I only know 1 person who owns an X-Box and he's an idiot anyway...the X-Box sold really bad over here in the UK.

as you all know, I have done an in depth review of ecco for smash pack. I want to make a seperate page dedicated to it, of course, so I need a bit of help. Anyone else played it, and wants to review it? Also, anyone find any cheats for it that i didnt? Someone wanna make sonar maps, guides, etc. ? I have all the passwords for it except for two (Three if you count medusa bay) I need the last fight, and deep water 2, so if anyone can find these it would be greatly appreciated. Sure, it is crappy, but hey, it is ecco.

Man, that sketchbook is so common over here and cheap too. The spine starts to go in a  few days/weeks. And this has happened to more than one person i know.*looks at her book* bah!

Another thing...the reason i removed the stickyness of this topic, is that the earth clan discussion is so small, that everyone is going to see your message anyways, without it being sticky. So unless it is really important, or the earth clan discussion becomes huge somehow, or it is from an admin, no stickies in earth clan. They are not a problem....Just...Useless, and I will most likely remove their stickyness.

Well, I have been thinking, and playing, and thinking, and I believe it is time to revive the Ecco the dolphin project. Anyone have any ideas on eccos personality, atlantian technology, etc? I need a bit more ideas.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
You all have many good ideas, but I need a bit more format. So whoever has posted, I would appreciate it if you put all of your ideas together into one post containing1. what you would like to explain2. an explanation of itThats all. Not hard. Its just hard to read all of your ideas fragmented like that, and would be much easier.

any board that mindless deserves to be bashed to hell, AND YOU KNOW IT!

<div id='container'>
Who cares about other websites crappy boards, anyways? I agree with Al in some respects...maybe not that they should be bashed, but that everyone should STOP CARING about it.

I like to listen to intrumental music as well, especially for suspensful writing. Hans zimmer is a god.

heh let them fight it out phosis. vantid likes the guild and eao hates it. and im one out of many who is sick of eao bitching about how she hates the guild anmd thinks everyone who posts there is a retard. sure that sites gay...who cares i just want to see fighting c.c
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
eao is just jellous cause she was banned from the gryph guild cause no one there accepted her. shes jelous because people there are better off then she is and so she uses her frusterations to attack that place...thus getting banned.its an anti social problem and to be honest i suffer from the same thing but at least i know how to destroy a social gathering better then she can. how else did i end up with my own community?

How about the "geology/geography" of Ecco?I was going to post months (a year?) ago about "where ecco lives and where he went"I think Ecco's story is in the future; in a future in which the dolphins grew up in intelligence. They intellectually became the Humans' equals (ever if I think that all animals, including men, are equal).

I just received my drawings that I did for Noriko. They are up too if anybody is interested or cares....

 Anyways, spiffy idea!!! It'd be a neato addy for sure. And just another thing to manage, on the downside. &lt;=/

I think he replied to my first post, too. It was about the Ecco 2 BETA - I wanted to know how to actually play the game, and he gave me the supper spiffy C x8 code.

<div id='container'>
SHIT, those are great. 8O

Oooh, I love classical music, too. In fact, most of my CDs, burned and retail, are mostly soundtracks of movies, or all background music. c.c

If this board's an RP-only board, then I can see where they're coming from. Normally when roleplaying, you don't put an actual smily, just say it. Like *smiles*

You hit the C button 8 times, and that brings up the debug menu.

Wow !!!! It's GREAT !!!

The time machine music thing is not a glitch. I went into the debug in the GBA game, and saw that, yes, there is only one song through the whole game.What. The. Fuck.  What kind of shit is that?! One fricken' song, and that's it?! &gt;:XFuck that's it, I'm not getting it. (well, I suppose U could, if you want to be the one with most "Ecco stuff"....BTW.... I appologise if I'm going off-topic, but..... how many songs do the GameGear Ecco games have?
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I have been listening alot to video game soundtracks as of late. Some songs can really inspire some ideas into you.

Alright, I know how to scan and everything, but if you know me I suck at figuring out what to do when it comes to computers. How do I scan pic to this site(with a URL and all)? :?  I've tried once or twice, but I can't figure it out....Help!!!

<div id='container'>
not the oriignal ecco game. your thiknig of defender of the future. to be honest the real ecco storyline is the one ed annuziatta designed.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah! DOTF Had a crap story.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
I would remove the DOF level where you had to bust up that damn egg feeding machine...RAAARGH!!!!That level SUCKS. I hate it.    That's what I dislike about the Ecco series, frustration. That needs to be eliminated in the next Ecco game. Whenever THAT is.  
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
Yeah! DOTF Had a crap story.WHAT ?!?!?Then, it's the proof that we haven't got the same tastes at all !!!!I think DoTF has got a really interesting and complex story.
</div>
<br />

<div id='container'>
i didnt think the story was crap i just thought the foe world was crap. thats phosis opinion you crazy cracked head assed broad.

Let me tell you all a story to explain why I'm so extremely depressed right now.  Cuz I know that at least some of you will listen. It all originally started sometime last year.  I never said anything about it to anyone, not even my best friend, because I didn't want to think about it.  My sister's 3 kids were taken because someone she knew called Child Protection Services.  I was never very clear on the exact circumstances but apparantly this person did it because my sister hadn't payed her the several times she had babysat and she said that my sister's house was a hazard because of all the junk.  Which was true, the house was pretty much a disaster.  Since then she moved into an apartment and keeps it in pretty good shape.  Anyway, like I said the kids were taken and put into foster care.  After a while they were returned only because her oldest daughter (who is 4 now) was having problems.  I believe it was while she had the kids that her husband was arrested CSC with a 14-year-old girl and he's still in jail now, my sister has filed for divorce but there have been difficulties with that.  Anyway the kids were only back for a short time when they were taken again just short of a year ago.  It was apparantly because my sister hadn't done all the things she was supposed to do, get a job, take parenting classes, those were two of the main things.  She had moved into the apartment just shortly after this I believe.  She's always had trouble keeping a job and there were plenty of excuses for all the other things.  Even tho she should have done her part, I still think it's unfair because there are families in worse situations.  I think that kids should only be taken from their parents only if their being abused, and this was not the case.  Despite everything my sister was always a good mother to her kids, it was her soon-to-be-ex-husband who was neglectful to the younger two.  But he's been in jail for several months and is looking into several more years.  Apparantly the case worker who's been on this case has been determined from the start not to return my sister's kids to her.There have been several trials on this case whether or not my sister should have parenting rights.  She was allowed to visit them for an hour each week in the FIA building.  Recently there was a final court that would decide the outcome of the case, but at the end the judge had not yet decided. So we've been waiting for over a month.Today my sister informed me that the decision has been made...she has lost the kids.  She will be able to see them one last time on Thursday.  But only she can go.  I haven't seen them since the one visit I had with them several months ago.  I will not see them again until they are 18.  That's 14 years from now.Even tho I know I will see my nieces and nephew again someday it feels like I've lost them for good.  I have loved them is if they were my own children.  I had been looking forward to watdching them grow up.  But now I won't be able to.  They will already be grown up the next time I see them.  That's all I have to say now.

an asshole nieghbor of mine did the same thing to my family a couple of years ago. the police came over and barged into our house and tried to take pictures of the house. it was total bullshit because police cannot come into your house without a warrent. if they do its relly illegal. anyhow our house was a diaster back then, and at the time i was cleaning it so i had garbage all over the floor and was trying to get it nice and back to normal. the child protective services investigated our house and concluded that it wasnt a big deal. that asshole nieghbor also stole my dog. it kinda hurt me cause that little dog of mine was the first dog i ever owned and after that i couldnt get into dogs anymore. that asshole nieghbor also sicked his dog on my cat and nearly killed him. Pieper (my cat) had suffered a spine or hip (not sure) injery a little while back because of an accident. well it fucked him up again luckly my dad found him trying to get somewhere safe. Pieper still has alot of the wounds a piec eof his tales missing, you can tell he had a hip problem but hey for a cat who took on a pitbull piepers the strongest cat i ever seen. he's still alive now just sleeps alot.

Call me a hopeless Ecco-jocky, but I loved ALL the storylines, no matter how crappy they seemed. Each is uniquin its own way. And perhaps we were NOT meant to fit all the story lines into a neat tittle line. Look at Final Fantasy, 11 Game saga, with 11 difourant storylines.

<div id='container'>
Would it not be easier to simply reorganize all the posts already up? :?

Really now Raptor, remove the challanging parts in a game? Then what would be left to play for? It would be like Sims, looks interesting but sucks ass because there is no point to the thing, no challange.

Bah, your only saying that becuz you dont have th emoney to buy a system, or want to have to put money into another system. If you were to get an xbox with games and shit with it, im sure you wouldnt be sayin shit like "Xbox sucks!" and shit.

I was looking through some old picture, and out of nowhere, I come to a section of Sea World pictures. Anyway I find a couple of pictures of the now deceased whale, Bjossa! THe pictures were taken 7 months before her death. I'd love to scan these pics, but I can't put them on the site. Anyway, for anyone who's interested (if I can get any help  ) I can show you the pictures. There really good pics, I took the at the "Dine with Shamu" So there very good. (                        :)
