Alright folks those of you who were former members will need to re-register. I haven't fully tested this new forum but supposibly is is integrated with postnuke. I decided to restart the intire website fresh since it was that time anyways. Anyone who wants to bug me about getting the old shit up needs to lay off. It wont be back.Anyone who wants to whine about getting the Illmatic skin back up. Lay off. I am only human i'll get to it. So im sure by now you get the point. I hope to see everyone back and fresh again. =)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ironically I'm the first one to sign up here, funny isn't it? ^^;; Well, even though I had to shake my had and smile a little about your current news post there on the main page I still wish you good luck and hope you won't "end" the Caverns of Hope ;)Well, good luck with the site, I'm sure it will grow just as big as it was before! I'll check back sometimes just as usual. :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hehe, I'm here too :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
and..... that last one was me..... Friecco.............FINALLY....

<br />
<div id='container'>
Why I've been checking back here semi-daily almost since I noticed the website was downyogoatseThank you for your attention. * bows *
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
where do i register?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i figured it out!

i don't know if i heard that one.

"it's good to be back in the warm waters of earth"

took me about 3 minutes to figure it out lol

<br />
<div id='container'>
w00t! *squeals in joy* About time too Arkon *hugs*Cally?!  Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you for about a month. Did you change your email or something?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhttp//www.asksnoop.com/ translate your site into snoop dog form.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What's this stuff anyway?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sorry Modu *hugs* My email was being stupid for a while, and I got your email - but haven't had a chance to reply because of school work and crap like that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, I see then  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
heh thats awesome trellia. *Looks at caverns of hope with the snoop dog filter*o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
whoa eao figured it out before you dreadlord. ethier eao has been eating her pack of braineys or....naw that can't be it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
And I make my triumphant return... with a burnt pizza...Thought I'd stop by and let people know I'll be here, though it may take a while before I can make regular visits. For when the time comes, I request that my fics not be reposted as I am reworking them (the Song of the Rising 'Remix') The opening of the new prelude is better than the entire original piece.What will be the fate of the former sections: comics, hoax, email etc.? Will they too be restarted and will any be left out? I now have the capability to go through on some of my ideas for those sections.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
If you werent so goddamned deaf artreus i said i was reconstructing everything. new sections, new attitude, new people (depending on who i feel like getting rid of.).
</div>

Sounds like a enzyme or something.

M'kay, the artwork forum lives yet again. Arkonviox.com has been down for quite a while with the server problems and such and the whole site being erased - but that doesn't mean that nobody stopped drawing wink:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I had a similar problem, try copying and pasting the password, that worked for me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually Cally, I have been pressured to joined the ranks of Elfwood. I have new work there, not much but most of my new stuff is still on a waiting list. View it here, mostly old stuff, but check in once and awhile for new art.http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/v/a/vanessachacon/vanessachacon.htmlOf course, you can AIM me if you want to see it now. ^_^my name on there is atolm rider.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yay!! Atolm artness! I never knew you made it onto Elfwood *gryn* Lucky thing. *browses*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well I thought I'd just make a post to let everyone know I'm still alive.  erm...dunno what else to say..Just don't expect me to be around much.  I have priorities now.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
lol! That is hilarious! I tried it out on my own site, funny stuff!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow! Atolm! Those are awesome! I love those creatures that you created, those are so cool! And I love how you did Arkon and Nori! Great work!I ought to draw some more pictures of my characters
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah Tethys it is good to hear from you again. ^_^I am very glad that this forum is back up again, it did not feel the same without it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The site will proceed on normally after Arkon gets everything fixed. Patience  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Welcome to the new board! Arkonviox.com moved to a new server, so we now have this new board. Sorry that the old discussion was lost. I've done quite a bit of updating to the Ecco 2 Beta site, and fixed every broken image and link (I think.) There is new information on the "Mystery Levels", including information about how they display VRAM data (causing differing results each time the level is loaded), added a new image to that page, corrected various cosmetic aspects of the site, fixed every broken image in the Levels pages, uploaded Histronic's version of the Levels 11-18 guide, and more.I hope you like the new content! NOTE)-- Deven GalloEcco 2 Beta Web Site Administrator
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I've downloaded an Ecco 2 ROM which is quite easy to find on the internet, but no one else seems to have noticed some of these odd things about it. Here is the ROM file. http)

The fox is here! The fox is here!Krymson has arrived at the board.It's been a while since i've Played ecco, but my interest has been rekindled, as of late. Well, i really don't have anything else to say, for now, so... :D

Atolm is teh artist. *bows*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's not a prerelease, because my real copy of the game is exactly like that. In my game for the Genesis, I have experienced numbers 3 &amp; 4.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Copy and paste is a good bet, then you can change it to something more memorable in your account.

It Kitnee!! *huggles* XD
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thank you all.  *bows*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Same here. 3 and 4 happens in the actual game.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I hope I didn't take anyone's space who wanted to start something here.    Ahem, anyway, to ask an interesting question about Ecco 1...When Ecco traveled back to the prehistoric age, the Asterite said he's going back 55 million years, correct?That's ten million years AFTER the dinosaurs and other giant reptiles went extinct.  So why are there Pteranodons?  Because I don't think they were around the same time as the Mesyonichids (land-ancestors of the dolphins).  Something to think about  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ahahhaha!  Oh man, that's hilarious!  I'm reading my story with this enabled, it's too funny!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Spelling error, Arkon!! In the title bar - it says "Arkonviox.com :wink:It's At!!!! HIIIII!!! XD *huggles*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I tried doing that with story posted on Fanfiction.net, bit it didn't work. &gt;.&lt; Now that would have been fricken hilarious! XD
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, right  :D Well, maybe the game designers were not as good in history. Or maybe it was a "parallel stream of time", where no comet has crashed into the Earth... After all, Ecco is a "stone that spits the time stream in two". Maybe it all started when Asterite has first sent him into the past?..
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
HAHA, true.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
don't you dare touch me...well... atolm,you can touch me

I'm working on a pic I started when ark.com was off.It makes me to think...I need a colored Ark pic for it, and also a Whitefin pic drawn by Cally...Could you help me there, guys ?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hiya guys !!!!It's so nice to see ya again !I just wanted to tell you my feelings about the site now...I'm really depressed about all these mistakes , all these lost things...We have to rebuid all that we made before...I've lost all my posts, all my comments, my statue, my P.M.s, my gallery...I'm worried about some of them, like Tidesinger, because I dunno if they'll join again...But like Noriko said to me, the most important thing is to be together.Even if we have lost our topics, our messages, etc. , we're always a team after all !And all together, I'm sure we'll be able to pass this hard moment ! *snif*So...Welcome back again to all ^^     *cries*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The mesonyx (ancestor of the dolphin) appeared 65 millions of years ago   they're just glyphes ! I saw it in the Ecco PC game, when I used my soner in the air.

Tonight though and probably tomarrow night won't be any updates. We need to get everyone who once visited this site back so i appointed...whoever wants to do that dirty work for me in charge =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
:D I was starting to miss this site pretty badly. But I'm glad it's up! Welcome back everyone ^__^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Gonna be lots of work to get all this stuff back up. Hope all the admins are up too it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
YAY! My favorite forum is back! It has been close to a month, and the net has been somewhat boring without this site.Good for you Arkon! I am very glad.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Lizzax btw, HIIIIIII!!! I'm glad everything is up again! :D

Many of you might have noticed avatar support is turned off. I will be readding it pretty soon and will only allow people to upload avatars rather then link them.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yea, so much was on that forum, many memories too. We will just start from scratch. Meanwhile my only concern is getting well again, winter flu is never good. *achoo!*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ok, but what about 1&amp;2? I have the US Genesis version and the US Sega CD version-- neither of those occur in either of them.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
  yeah dun hug me...   
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
don't worry dreadlord. No one will hug you =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*ahem* Can somebody please explain what happened here?  Why did the site suddenly dissappear a month ago?  I've searched for some kind of explanation and haven't yet found one...P.S. No, you don't know me. I've just been a casual visitor to both Arkonviox.com and Caverns of Hope for the last few months and was quite surprised to find one of them gone.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I had a life for a few weeks. a marvelous, wonderful life. And a hot girlfriend. It seems since this site opened up, my life has gone again. I broke up with the girl, and am doing bad in school again. Oh, and i waste time on this again. It was only a matter of time though, before this life returned. Im sure it wont be so bad. Good to see you people again. Or at least, the majority of you
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Don't be bitter, now, Pho.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Since you have both US versions, I would think that number 1 would be out of the question. As for 2, I haven't tried it yet, so I can't really say.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Technical Problems. There gone now and shouldn't ever happen again. New host hopefully they arent fuck heads.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
If you goto your control panel to avatars you can upload your avatar!I made it so you can only upload them cause im sick of people with avatars that don't work. So have fun =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I got the art gallery up, members will need to let me know if they want there art gallery back up.The requirements are the artwork must be ocean related (ecco artwork preferred.). Anything non ocean related will be removed.So please let me know who wants in on his deal.Thanks
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks for that, Friendly Neighborhood Arkon! &gt;:p But seriously, it's really great to hear that you got a new server that won't us over.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sure Arkon! Do I have to re-submit my stuff? I'm guessing most likely right?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
My story is going along quite nicely, figuiring plots and what the out come is and all. Then I, the buffon, did not write any of the information that you friendly folks posted to me about your own characters. So my aplogies, please repost you character bio if you wish to be in my story. Tell me as much as possible about your character, I want to keep everything accurate.  :D Once again, sorry for the trouble. -_-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yay and to start with, i am using the avatar that Eao made for me, even though this Atolm pick does not have the giant horn. Either way, thanks Eao!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*gives Dreadlord an extra big hug* ^_^no more complaing now ya hear? XD
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Count me in Arkon!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well...It is against disasters such as these that I've always kept a backup copy of my website on my hard drive.I've known a couple of people to whom this has happened actually.  The moral: if you put THAT much work into a website, don't take any risks...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
your making a useless point. The fact is i have a backup of my website. The downside is its too big to upload in one shot, i need something better then 56k. Also when my website was destroyed i was in the process of converting it over to the database. Since the conversion was barly even started i decided to start fresh.It won't hurt anyone right now for me not to have any info up. Well have some awesome stuff coming up anyways like new improved ecco sections. An all new All in the Family "GrandTheftYogoat" and much more coming out. Plus two all new Ecco roms. Just...layoff, have patience...and if your not patient get lost.Ha ha ha ha
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Alright so far we have two new galleries.Atolmhttp//arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album01&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.php
</div>

what happened phosis?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Way to go, Arkon! I've been waiting to hear! Keep up the good job!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Dangit, I'm gonna need the URL from my avatar.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Looks like I'm the first to put a character bio in right here.    The Orca Caller, whose true name is Cariu, is a regular trasient Orca with an extraordinary talent; to be able to control and morph into the elements, like fire, wind, ice, and others.  Her history is quite grim...she's been cast out of her pod for refusing to attack and eat any cetacean.  Her life was saved by a dolphin, but her pod attacked it anyway.  She now lives as a loner Orca, telling stories of the sea and disappearing as if she were a ghost.  She's involved in her own story, which I'll put up when I'm finished with the first book (it's a trilogy).Like I said before, you can do with my character what you will.  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
how many horns does Atlom have? I ran out of room
</div>

it reminds me of the chat roomhttp://www.asksnoop.com/shizzolator.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Feao.vortx.net%2Fhnh&amp;mode=snoophell, this may even make my grammer better!

Hi everyone !I wanted to know something...1) I noticed that my signature isn't always shown in my posts, even if I've chosen the option "Always show my signature" in my settings.I've to edit my posts, and choose this option:"Attach signature (signatures can be changed in profile)"Is it just a little bug ?2) In the profile, some informations (like the location, the website, etc.) are impossible to enter (no options in the profile editor).Will it be possible in the future ?Thanks for you answers !_!*kisses !!!!!*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
One giant horn to be precise, the rest is pretty much smaller spines. Refer to my gallery for the full pic. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think this refers to the Pteranodon (cant spell) that helps you get around. A creature like that should have been extinct by that time.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
sure thing.   I wasn't trying to start an argument, I just didn't know the information  that you pointed out in your last post.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah. Maybe they just didn't give a crap. It is a video game after all. It's kind of like asking how sonic is blue. it doesn't have to make sense really. Maybe I am just bitter after wasting 40 on the smash pack.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
If you can only upload them, then how come it gives the option to put in a url?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yay! Now everyone can know how pathetic I am in real life through the depiction of my sad dolphin face
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
naw dont worry that was something people needed to know. im blunt like that don't take it offensivly.

If this sounds familiar, its because I copied it from another post.Artreus, MaleDesciption: Bottlenose dolphin. Slighty blue tinted. Four-pronged star on his mellon. He is friendly, though is hesitant to become close with anyone do to events in his past. He has had dealings with several species, so is welcome to new ideas. He is considered somewhat faster than most dolphins, and has the ability to shift to the form of an orca, again bearing the star. This shifting ability is rarely used due to the discomfort it causes. He appreciates being alone and has a few close friends. I'll let you play with him however you see fit.

NORIIIIIIIII!!! Mah Bwee Buddy ish back!!! WHOOO! *super-tackle-mega-glomps you*

Thank God I saved my story!!! o.oKitnee grew up as being one of Ecco's best friends, always accompanying him on his little treasure hunts and childish games. Once Ecco became older, he started his grand adventures. But Kitnee always kept in touch with him. After the first battle with the Vortex, Ecco returned to his good friend and introduced her to the Asterite. Kitnee was awed by the supreme being and wanted to help protect it. So Kitnee became the Asterite's protector. However...One dark day, the Vortex came again. Fighting for her own safety, Kitnee hid in a small alcove in the Asterite's cave. She watched in horror as the Asterite was destroyed, its last two globes hidden away, cursing herself, for she was not strong enough to fulfill her promised duty as Asterite's Protector. After the Queen and her cronies left, Kitnee swam as fast as she could KitneeSpecies Hrm...a few years younger than EccoGender Ah...I'm sure you know of my picture of Kitnee.Reaction to the Atolm Kitnee is friendly generally, but is wary when approaching or meeting someone she hasn't seen or met before.Abilities: Speed is not Kitnee's forte, although she can swim pretty fast for an orca. She's also very smart.  Given the same ability as Ecco to breathe underwater by the Asterite, Kitnee also has a powerful sonar that can blast through rock.

Nori, i know you feel same as i do about animayx right now. they're a bunch of assholes at this time, but when they see that thier community is falling apart because they discriminate too much. i played along as long as i could, but it's gone too far, they're acting like a bunch of nazi's. any way thanks for the hug Atolm ^___^  is the avatar you made me showin up?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well, i'm changing my origional info. to make it make more sence. DreadLord(called that by mortal men) is named Shephuphan in reality. he is the result in a fusion of a demi-god and a wizard, and retains the personalities,traits,and powers of both. said to have a double voice like an angel does when he talks. you have a pic of him atolm(well duh! you made it lol) i'm changing his age to however old he would be today if he was fused in the year 12,000 bc.

Thanks for that, but Dolphin made my avatar last time, and I didn't get to save the URL.Wonder where he is, I'll ask again if he doesn't mind.  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeh, whatever.  I just wanted to bring that up because it seemed kinda strange to me.  To keep this topic from dying for a little while, how about we post what strange things we found about the Ecco games, or any other games.  Just for laughs and maybe even some 'ooohs' and 'ahhhs'.Ready, go!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes it is, Thank you for using it.
</div>
<br />

'tis no problem. you maded it for me. i likey it.  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So far so good...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah. Maybe they just didn't give a crap. It is a video game after all. It's kind of like asking how sonic is blue. it doesn't have to make sense really. Maybe I am just bitter after wasting 40 on the smash pack.Sonic's blue because HE'S !!!!   :? *growls*About the Pteranodon...I dunno...It could be a mistake; the programmers didn't know about its extinction.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Nah, they dumped Sonic in a bucket of blue paint. Sorry Sten, I could not resist. ^_^So many strange things happen in Ecco. Here is one that I have not thought of in a very long time. It is the level where you have to find all of those baby orcas, I am talking about it in hard mode. I f I remember right, there were broken glyphs on that level. Anybody ever fixed that? It has been bugging me for awhile now.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Ho...There pics of you, Vantid...Hum...I don't like to see the real faces of the persons on this forum...Next time, I won't watch... :?

Probably seeing the actual person's picture ruins the whole character theme I assume.

Hi everyone !Nice to see that our GREAT artists are still there ^^I wanted to ask you somethingD I'm waiting for your answer, and...THANK YOU BEFOREHAND !
</div>

<div id='container'>
Okay. I remember one thing in TOT...It happens in the "Big water" level, when you ask the Leader to bash the wall behind which 2 Asterite's globes are located. If you try to talk to him again, while he moves backwards, you'll get a pallette bug. D

I haven't even visited the site until today so I didn't know it was up.I WOULD put my stuff back up there.  But Side 7 hasn't been working for me all week.  I always delete files once they're safely uploaded to save room, and Side 7 is the only place where I have my Ecco-related pics.  And I can't draw more until I finish a couple of requests, which I haven't even started yet.So you'll just have to be patient.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, nevermind.  I forgot I had two pictures on my website, and another one elsewhere.  So now I have three pictures up.  But I won't be able to ad the reast until Side 7 decides its going to work for me.  I get the feeling no one else is having the same problem...Well, at least I got something.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So what's gonna happen to the Art Contest?  Will we just not have it anymore?  Or will it start over again?  Or just what?  I didn't even think about it until now.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
BWEE-eee-EEE-eee-EEE!! Hi everybody!!! Um, yea, I haven't talked to Sten yet, Arkon. o.o;;...anyways! Yea, I know what you mean, Dread, but I still go there. lol, I can't help it. I was there when that place was just an eency weency baby....plus I know all those guys really well. I can just kick their asses if they get out of line irl. Wootage!
</div>

I guess that's up to Arkon. Once everything gets settled again, he'll probably bring back.

I've recieved two theories on what the odd purple sprite in the Vortex Queen stage (level 17) is:1) a fish.2) a shark (in the background.)Are there any more theories? Which of these is correct? I'm going to look into it, and will post any information I can find, or that anyone can provide. Thanks!

Three CrystalsIt is a collaborated piece that took over a month to plan, sketch, finalize, ink, and colour between Draconafin and myself. She accidently foddied up Whitefin's colours on her past form *first ever form, which is just black and white* but tis cool. We had alot of fun making past and present forms for Trellia, and Future forms for Whitefin and Draconafin. Comments and crits are more than welcome either in here or in a comment in the gallery it's self.

ive asked this question b4 on gametalk.com (and thats how i found out about this site).ive been playing ecco 1 on my old sega megadrive and im stuck on a level called city of forever. on the pc, this is level 21, im not sure about the number of it on the MD. anyway, ive tried using a walkthru i found on the net for this level. it sez to go all the way to the right and sonar a statue, then head left and find a hidden tunnel that shoots you upward into wat appears to be a kinda pond. the walkthru sez that here there should be a ring that teleports me to the time machine. just my luck, there isn't one. ive tried getting body of water thats highter up but i don't seem able to get enough altitude. to gain speed wat i do is swim fast up out of the water and then swim along the bottom and jump out of the water on the other side, then, using the speed i get i swim fast allong the bottom and come shooting out of the water at high speed, but all i seem to do is bonk the legde on the way down. is there sumthing im doing wrong? should the ring be where i am? does the nearby glyph do anything to help? am i just out of luck?thanx in advance for any help (even if it is just to say 'dude, your out of luck!')
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
umm this is VERY off the topic, but there IS a reason why sonic is blue (other than the 'blue paint' theory). Dr. kintobor was messing around with these chaos emeralds one day and he blew himself s***less. the explosion made him into dr. robotnik (the baddy that sonic is fightin). the explosion also souped up a pair of sneekers that just happened to be near by. Sonic (who to start with was brown and very spikey) finds these and tries them on and zooooom off he goes. when he reaches t supa sonic speeds the boom and the heat given off makes sonic blue hot. now the question is, why didn't sonic return to his original colour once he cooled down? i don't think he ever cools down enough coz hes always zipping up and down all day long.well maybe that ended years of staying up at night pondering the quetion. or maybe it shows to you people wat kind of a life i leed.oh by the way, i would like to aknowlegde my girlfriend's lil bro, Morgan who enlightened me on the subject of Sonic's 'Blueness'.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
sweeet.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm. This is supposed to be Ecco the Dolphin discussion forum. Am I right or am I wrong?  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
He's right you know.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Pretty godamn bad, to tell you the truth. But I am alive, somehow. Its good to see you
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah. No one cares why sonic is blue. And whoever told you that got it all wrong. Robotniks name is actually Eggman. so leave sonic alone
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I remember that bit. What you're doing is the way to go. It just takes awhile to get the angles and such right. And then you find-guess what-another pool. Or two. I myself did the level on an emulator, so I had the advantage of saving and going back at my liesure. It takes practice and patience, but it can be done.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The intructions on there are quite correct except for the part where you got shooted to a pond, I have not encountered that. A good way to find the opening is that before you sonar the statue glyph that there is some sort of green block that does not allow you to go through. When you go and sonar the staute glyph, go back to where this green block once was and go through the wall, it should take you a room with a teloport ring and a place of air. I hope this makes sense to you. Good luck!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
:D i saw that pic in your gallery last night. i really love it! *hugs trellia's forms* ^^ you guys did an awsome job! good work!

i don't like people messing up my art.  thats why i go solo.are you and Trellia lovers or somthing? or just into this whole "internet soul sibling" stuff.damn, every one is so tactile.it's like in real life, 2 people have't seen each other in 4 minnutes, so when they incounter each other they have to rub up aginst eachother like sexcrazed dolphins or somthing.ehah never mind me.I'd just prefere to save my physical affection for being specail affection, and not to give it away like a penny hooker.

I recently got a copy of "The Sims Delux" which comes with the sims creator.  I also hastly downloaded the editors I wanted, but cannot get my copy of Blue Print to work. (edits objects)so If anyone else here has said products and polygon editing programs mabye we can make sets that are ecco-like(i have floor and wall paper so far).  Like making a tailless dolphin morph human (i have a catfaced lady, dog man and squrill boy).so anyone know how to do these?  I want to make/edit my own funiture so we can have coral looking funiture, or a chair that looks like it was made from a vorte's exoskelliton.*sighs*  so can we do this?

ah Sten, it is so cute! Good job!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Who is he exactly?All I know is that he wrote a good story. -_-(It's me, Sten, from my father's computer)Then, Aty...I'll explain you...When I arrived for the first time on Arkonviox and registered in the forum (during December 2001, if I remember well), I didn't know a lot of persons yet, and I didn't speak English as good as today.I felt a few lost...And two of the members who helped me the most to understand and interact with the rest of the group were Kitnee and Tidesinger.They often explained me the things I didn't understand, and were really friendly with me; even if I were still an unknown person at this moment.It's one of the reason for which I consider them as very good buddies, and why I want to find Tidesinger.

eao, it sounds like YOU have never experienced true friendship or love. i think thats why you're bitter towards other peoples friendships. honestly, cut it out, you're an awsome person, but we dont need you getting angry at every good comment sent off to someone. please dont just get mad, im trying to look at this from a different persepctive. if i was on the outside of something like this, sure id be a bit bitter too. but the question is, why do you have to make your feelings public? i know that sounds stupid, but would it hurt to not send that reply talking about how stupid me and cally are for calling each other sisters?

Stanined glass is fun. I use to take that classall the time in high school, etching on mirrors was  better though. ^_^
</div>

<div id='container'>
well, there are plus sides and negative sides when it comes to doing art together. Pros being that you can share your art with someone, and that alllows unique styles to merge. ^_^cons include people screwing over your artwork, something that has happened to me a few times. But i believe it is the level of trust you give to a person to allow them to do a drawing with you.Personally, i think that this is a small reason to make to make a big fuss over with. My best friend and I are like sisters too and it does not bother us one bit, who cares what others say right? That does not matter at all.I kinda wish i can do the collbrated art again.BTW Cally, congrats on making it into Elfwood! I told you you can do it!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ok. I'll guide you from the beginning of the level. At the very beginning of city of forever, go all the way to the  right, (ignoring the current that takes you upward to another pool),  there will be a path that allows you to go up. do that and you will encounter a green block that has yellow stripes. now continue upward to encounter a type of fork path, take the path on the right and go to the very upper right corner and you will encounter a statue glyph, sonar it and it should say something like "access granted" doing that, go all the way back to where the green block once was, it should be gone, revealing a secret path that takes you to the teloportation ring and a air pool. The ring will take you to the time machine. I hope this will work out. ^_^

it is simple. even a retard can figure it out.

Alright eao you can put your oceanic/ecco related art work in your new art gallery.

How 'bout I just give a simple "Welcome!"   :D

Everybody else is getting these huge "welcome back's".  Doesn't anyone care that I'm here?

I'm having the same problem.  My signature won't show up, and I have it set to always show my signature.  And when I go to my profile it's gone!  No matter how many times I re-type in my signature and hit "submit", it's always gone when I go back to my profile! And it never shows up in my posts.Another thing is, I noticed that in the memberlist two people have locations, and some people have websites.  But there is no place to put either in the profile for the forum.  And the stuff that I have in the other profile doesn't show up there.
</div>
<br />

Well, what I meant to ask is this: Will the art contest that had been going on be continued in the future sometime, or will that one just end and a new one started, *or* will there no longer be any art contest *at all* (and I mean like never again)?I realize that the answer to that question may not come for some time.  But I was just wondering what the possibilities are, if there has been any thought at all about what might happen to the art contest in the future.  The reason I was wondering is because the art contest that had been going on never did actually end.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Someday I might actually draw something that fits into the correct category so that I can post it on my gallery here.SOME day.Maybe.Well, actually I would draw more pictures of my characters.  Except I have no idea what do do with them.  They can't be just sitting there.  I've already done enough of that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thats....strange.I'm sure more animals are messed up in ecco 1.Morish Idols don't live in the artic.What are Morish Idols?Um...the thing about the broken glyphs in ToT in that one level, I think we already discussed that.  Somebody said they were "leftovers" or something like that.The first time I reached the Atserite in Ecco 1, he said "You must go back in time to just before the storm" or something to that effect.  And then he sent Ecco back to prehistoric times.  But, after that, when playing the same level (and I mean the first version, cuz I know you go thru two of those levels twice) he told Ecco to go back in time and get his missing globe, and then sent him back to the prehistoric times.Somehow, the messages got mixed up there the first time I played it.  And I was very confused that time cuz I didn't know what I was supposed to do.

The fuck is this, a contest? Okay, maybe your life is bad. I didnt say I wasnt doing good to compete or some crap. so I will talk about how bad my life is if i godamn want to. (it isnt bad, but you get the point.) Im not trying to be rude, but i hate when people try to one-up everybody like that.

It would be nice if you did some more pics Tethys, I love the way you draw your creatures. Maybe you can draw a scene from your story? Just a thought anyways.  :)

funny thing, that yellow dolphin on the right side with the mechanical blob on 'it's' right side reminds me of something I fiddled with once, minus the fin-thing and pointy teeth....hmmm...actually the similarity is really spooky. o_o;Nonetheless, I like it. Drawn nicely. There are definate traces of inconsistancy (particularly in the coloring work =) ), but that is to be expected when it is being worked on by multiple people...fortunatly though, it doesn't paricularly take away from the piece. ;) In particular, near the...erm...symbols near the words "Past" "Present" and "Future" I'm asuming are supposed to be a glow (if not then ignore this), but instead it just looks like a wierd burst of color around it - a fade into white would have been nice. One more thing (man I hate doing this... -_-), sketch lightly! You can see places where Mr. Eraser failed to do his duty. =)Belive it or not, I really do like it though. The literal drawing part is far superior to anything I could do...its just that I have ninja coloring skills so I like to be critical in that aspect. ;) Sorry for the critisism, but hey, you asked! =) (well kinda...)-Feel free to disregard everything above this line-Eao, chill out. Please, I do not believe that it is your God-given right to rip apart everything that anyone else enjoys, simply because you do not share their sentiments. I for one don't give a rats-patootie about my "character" because truth be told, it isn't real! I doubt Alastor will take offense if he isn't drawn to perfection, and in all reality, I believe Alastor is ecstatic to be drawn at all, no matter the quality - the effort is what counts Eao....you need to work on your people skills. =)

Thats right. This month, almost every day, new games are being released for the cube. Well, maybe not that many games...But a hell of a lot! Sonic mega collection comes out tommorrow, and I will tell you all about it. (I am selling my chrono trigger cartridge to buy it.) Metroid Prime comes out on the 18th, and the previews at IGn have been amazing. Medal of honor frontline should have come out a couple days ago. That BMX game with the breasts is coming out too, if anyone here is 13-16, male, and horny enough to care. (Im looking in Yogoat's direction here.) Oh yeah, and no sign of ecco. Just wanted to painfully remind you that ecco 2 will not be out anytime soon, and no news has been heard of them making it. BTW, if you are looking for games to pick up that came out recently, I have a few suggestions. Timesplitters 2 is probably the most amazing console FPS I have ever witnessed, and is Tri-platformed, for all you who  like your xbox's. Godzilla: destroy all monsters is also a really good game to pick up for gamecube, especially if you have a lot of friends. I think Nintendo is doing pretty well right now, and I hope this habit carries out through 2003
</div>
<br />

HI TETHYS!! I care that you're here. Nori luffs everybody. Also, hi Miana! ^_^ hey, it looks like we're getting SOME of the old people back, right? I don't remember joo, so it MUST mean that you're an older arkonviox.com member! ...either that or that stupid cold medicine ish making me feel funny again.

Why the fuck would I try and "one-up" you?! I'm not that shallow; I just couldn't stand your bitching anymore. Boo-hoo, you lost your girlfriend. I've said it once and I've said it before - having a girlfriend is not the only thing in life! You wanna talk about your life? Then fine, I will, too. I've had 25 or so emotional breakdowns in the past 2 months, my family is totally falling apart, I've had so many depressed moments to the point of suicidal thoughts, and yet I've hidden it all behind a fucking farce of happiness and telling myself everything will be OK just so I could keep myself from totally losing it.Sorry if you think I've just posted this for pity, because I don't do that, either. Anybody I've ever talked to can back that up. I just needed to get that out. Sorry for not being my usual fucking cheery self.

Aww...Trell! I remember that really cool quote he said back on the old forum You live, you affect your world. But is is what YOU need, you are difuorant inside. This Orca lives and had strength of a sort. It lost so much and went through so man things but it perservered. And one day it will be dead. It will be morned, its childr will move on and it will be forgotten. I wonder if I am destined to be forgotten, will I fall in the shadow of greater beings? I am born of murder, the verry essince of that which takes life, and grants power if you wish it. I will do what I must, become what I must as I have grown to realise what little choice I have...... such is the fate of young Keiko as well......."
</div>

I remember that quote that he said back in a thread that...I think Sten started? About her aunt or something? Then he said this really cool (and very comforting) quote about death. I forget what it was, though!

Here's a good question. ((Because I can't answer the first one seeing as how I don't have Ecco 1 *sob*))In TOT, when you go into the future, the Asterite has this cool matallic appearance, but during the present he looks more like multi-colored rocks. Why the change?

I don't have any ocean related artwork anymore... I guess because i stink at drawing dolphins... that and humans I constantly. Miana isn't even a dolphin anymore... But if you can find anything in http://www.dimlabyrinth.deviantart.comthan feel free to put it. Must finish avatar. *scurries off*

When I'm feeling sad....I simply remember my favourite things and then I don't FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLL....SOOOOO BAAAAAADDDDDD!!! Okay no, not really. Actually, what I usually need if I'm feeling down is a good dosage of The Simpsons.

A Moorish Idol is a yellow and black fish that kinda looks like an angelfish. Except the black stripes are thicker, I think, and...oh man I know the name but it totally escapes me right now, but the fin on their backs? Yea, it's longer and kinda pointy and stringy at the end.

yeah im having the same problem.also, when i come into the forums, it shows which places have new messages, but when i get into the sub section (ie artwork) everyone is marked as read.

Yes, Simpsons usually does the trick. That show is so funny.BTW Noriko you wouldn't by chance gotten those lines from a movie? I think it was Mary Poppins. Now I have the song stuck in my head! *grumble*Ah Kitnee, do not despair. That sort of scenario happened to me once long ago. I know it is rough, it will come to pass. Do not be sad, things will get better.

Bah, dont flip out. Atolm asked me how I was, so I told her. Im not going to lie. "Hey hey hey! Im feeling pretty good!" No way man. I mean, maybe I am now. But at the time, I wasnt. So I told her. and then you made some sarcastic comment, or something. here it is. I dont know how to quote, but you get the point."Ohh...don't even start with how bad your life has been going. My life has been hell since August 7th."That didnt seem like a very friendly comment in the first place. Sure my after comment was probably pretty Jerk-offish, but I just thought your REPLY, to my message which was to ATOLM, was pretty uneccesary.Sorry your having a bad time. Im pretty aware of what life entails, but as a very not-shallow person myself, that was not the only problem I was having. I dont want to get into a lot of "Ohh...don't even start with how bad your life has been going" messages, and tell you about all my other problems, as I dont feel it is necessary to post them in an Ecco the Dolphin forum. The point is, while you know I was having problems with my girlfriend, that was not what was getting me down, at least not for the most part. Since you dont care, and dont show pity, which is perfectly acceptable to my standards, I wont get into what is my problem. About the girlfriend, I am not concerned with that anymore. shes dead or gone or something. And I am, very fine with that. I dont want to get into a flame war on this forum. That would be very inapropriate of me to do. Plus, you seem like a pretty cool person for the most part. The post I made earlier was probably a little harsh, as I was pissed off about god-knows-what, and didn't give a shit at the time. Like I said, it wasn't really bitching. I posted one message saying what happened to me, (or some of it) and another replying to Atolms message. If you want to reply to things I say, go right ahead. But if you want to interrupt my reply to someone elses question, stating that my life "isnt all that bad" then I dont care to hear it, even if you are right. Its really nobody's business what goes on with me, and you can go ahead and think it as all because of girlfriend problems if you want. As I said before, my problems go just as deep as yours do. I just dont want to state what they are here.Getting down to the final point, I dont want to fight with you, or anyone else here. and as a reply to your question, "You wanna talk about your life?" The answer is, not really, no. You can tell me whatever you want about yourself, but I am not going to go "Bitching" about my "girlfriend problems" anymore. and as a line to everyone else, sorry for going off topic. As this is the welcoming topic, there wont be any more of this shit going down. We wasted your time, forcing you to read our flames. So if you still have a problem with me, and are angry, do it through a PM. we are both guilty of ruining a topic now, and now that I have a clear head, this shouldn't be. Everyone else, ignore this message, and go onto your happy posting lives. I dont have a problem with any of you, and my latest bitch session was purely frustration induced.Sorry Kitnee. I hope we can get past these latest strings of posts, and get on with our lives, as horrible as they may sound.Phosis out.

I been working on a skin for the forum. I decided to add it up early since i needed to replace that postnuke look badly. problem with the new look is its 50% done. and needs alot of work. the older looks will soon be back up as soon as i create a programming template so i can add them up with no hassle.

I think everyone hated the Postnuke skin. I know I did. It really feels like things are back to normal with this new skin. Looks very good.

This is Arkonviox.com, we come here for the insults and bad spelling....and the monkeys. Kinda like standing at the corner of new york and watch the masses insult each other with unclever fraises they've seen on tv. - Minus the monkeys ofcourse.Before i go on about the actual topic, lets explain the rules of engagement in the art forum, shall we? No bitching about your stupid fucking art site (That goes for you, eao.) And no making fun of the complete retards bitching about the stupid fucking art site - Thats my job. (...And Arkons, and Phosis...) This is a god damn art forum for posting your artwork for everyone to....err....whatever you post your picture for. Not running around like ninnys with squirt guns. Thats why we implemented a forum for flying shit we like to call the offtopic where eao can bitch about her art site and fucking Phosis can blender us with the girl he broke up with and how great the game cube is.Anyways, thats a cool pic Whitefin. You guys did an awesome job in my opinion.Edit: And lastly, Eao, just becuz Whitefin and Trellia are good friends doesnt mean you can go on yer retard tirade and bitch about it. Put yer straight-jacket back on, take your medication and get back into your shallow padded cell until you get better - or until you die. o_o;

okay just ignore the previous post i did. i was in a bit of a bad mood (shooting headache, cut myself while shaving (im 16, i shave what? every 2 months or so, and i had to cut myself on THAT day) lost my house key, found out i 4got to do an assignment, overall just one of those days). this was my way of calming myself down - i would get drunk but im broke.anyway i wrote a proper story for the ecco book of yours. Name dolphinEyes umm not sure about this - its kinda wierd (ill explain later)bio? ) and returned to atlantis. from his knowledge of the future, he left all those glyphs around the place so that when ecco arrived, it would help him out. he sent those glyphs to 55million BC using that time machine. then, he used the time machine himself. although it was set to return him home, the radiation he emmited messed up the time machine the same way it did the shard. instead he was shot about 1000 years later (to the present day). here is where he remains, waiting for the shard that took him into the past to appear, waiting to be able to return home to his familly and friends, waiting to hear the songs of his mate, waiting . . .moonflash knew he could not affect the past too much so he leaves the other animals other dolphins to themselves. occasionally he socialises with them but when he is asked about the future or past, he only gives cryptic answers that only make sense if you knew what he did.

I agree with the other people that this skin is much better than the postnuke one.  Good work so far, Arkon!  :)

The stranger the better, it's funny that way!I'm sure there are many who agree with me

Okay, but I want to add just one more thing.As some of you see, I have a nice avatar up now, but since I couldn't find another and have no idea about size, heh, so I have a URL from the Caverns until I know.So those of us who are from the Caverns and Arkon and noticed, credit goes to them, k?erm...now it's done.

Not as far as I know, nope. It might .. MIGHT be listed as a cheat in a magazine or something, or MAYBE we could find it by hacking the ROM somhow. I'm thinking all code to access it might've been removed from the final, and the actual editor was left over.

Arkon uses PN-phpBB2 or a derivitave to embed the forum into PN. Unfortunatly, this module tries to draw info from your PN profile and merge it with phpBB2's idea of things. This doesn't always work too well. Deal with it.

heres the deal.at my after school art class we're going to be painting ceiling tiles to decorate around the school and make it a better place blah blah blah. anyways, i decided to do a whole trellias bay scene....cause you know...no one will get it except for the cool ones.i have a preliminary sketch. i want help/opinions/crit on mostly the structure of the picture. not the picture itself cause its SUPER messy. ill be surprised if you can make out everything in it. heheh ^^; so basically, if you think i should change where something is, change what it looks like (ie the dolphin poses) or whatever, just let me know. many thanx //hang10.dolphinparadise.net/sketch.jpg
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
does it have to be penciled?slap some color on that mofo then i'll let you know what i think o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Good start. First thing I would say is straighten those dolphins out. Bending limits on that spinal collumn is something to the effect of -5 to +10 degrees off horizontal datum. Observe that, and smoothly flex the peduncle, and you'll end up with much more interesting dolphins that preserve the overal fluidity of the artwork.  Try not to flex more than one direction per plane, etc.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I dont get that many requests either, but if you need a pic, I'll try my best to do one. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I remember doing that project, I did two orcas. ^_^So far you are off to a good start, but do a color render please, that would be much more helpful than a pencil one.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah thank you! I would also like to say that another reason why I like to show my art is that if there is anything wrong with the pic, please let me know. Sometimes the bad stuff actually allows me to be a better artist. ^_^Do not hesitate to say anything!

Yogoatsy. And im sure you've made yogoat full of great murderous rage.Anyhow, welcome back. Dunno why you bothered, but good to see you.

it sounds like.....some kind of convergance of yogoat and my "asstash"whic was derived from "cheep as mustash"and asstash is a mustash that grows on one's butt.

the school would allow it?  ya know how learning places can be, the'll complane about copyright infringment and all that rot.  (dispite the fact somone painted book scenes on the walls, but thats reading)On the other hand.  If you're school and sega can shake hands on your progect mabye they can sponcer school things, like Art.  (stupid soda companitys give schools expencive score boards...how can I get Coke Cola to give me money *thinks*)is it painted on tile, or....tiled?how are you going to blow it up?  *sighs* I almost got to paint on the walls of my Highschool.  But I forgot what happned to it.....i was going to do a scene from beowulf or....Loard of the flies or somthing. My art teacher (non school) wishies the landloard will allow her to have me paint on the building.  But I don't like large scale, yes small is good...short and sweet.anywho the faceing dolphin has a smile of.....uh....enjoyment,  Like sniffing good coffie, if you like coffie...content.  I suppose knowing "i can't fall!" or humming Peater Pan's "I can fly" song laughing silently at the fish who can't.i'd photoshop this one for the hell of it.but if it's on the celing.....if...you could change the preciption as if you were in the water looking up....I think in 3D but cannot apply it to paper.somthig like a 3 quator looking up....I think i'd need that "Time Slice" camara this Tim guy came up with.  it takes a picture..in time but moves in space.It's on TV right now.  Look it up this devise is very cool.  it's like a "3d" photo that captures movment in time as if it were frozen.and yes, they photograhed dolphins, and there dolphin is the best, strangest photo they have!.I think like said camara.

Eao i want to know just what the fuck happened. youve known me for a long time. i kinda thought we were friends. youve known since the beginning that i draw, hell the first thing i did at the Undercaves was submit art. So what brought on this lovely bout of trolling my journal and bashing me? As soon as you heard that i knew about the gyphon guild it was oh they are a bunch of faggoty children all in love with theirselves no one loves me blah blah blah. i like the guild, i liek the people who are a part of it (hell i met Tagar and Nambroth and they are just like they are online...nice people). So whats your deal? what did *I* fucking do? answer me so i can just leave it at that. just leave my art alone. hell i dun even have a gallery here...why should i? ive nothing new thats worth showing thats for sure. does that make you happy eao? im sure you rhappy to know youv elost me as a friend. i was on your side...i used to smile when i read your posts and think hey this girl thinx liek me...all crazy and wierd. but now i know you lash out at anyone and everyone. thanx for this learning experience.

ECCO SCRAMBLED WORDS IS BACK !!!The most famous Ecco related game of the forum is now available again ! For the persons who have never played, or forgotten the rules, this is a brief help?In this game, you have to form anagrams with words coming from the Ecco world, so medusa bay --&gt;  ayeusmadb (2 words)When someone finds the word, she/he can form an anagram.If no one finds it, you have to give a clue, pass your tour, or change your word.Is it okay ?Then, let's play !falpiuereutpytild (2 words)

I don't get it guys. Why buy an XBox or Gamecube or PS/2 if you can get a decent PC for that value? Or ther're just some 'exclusive' games that are available only on that console?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
woah, i didn't really expect a response like this!yes an Oxymoron is like jumbo shrimp and Mircrosoft Works (i love that one!!)an oxyMoron is a 16 year old dumbass. pretty good looking and rather muscular. it has quite long hair for a guy (which is annoying). it is rather intelligent compared to others of its age group. it can doodle well (you should see the drawings it made in bio today!) Moonflash is the character he made up. beforehand he was known as 'Guest'. he recently started playing ecco again on his sega mega drive (its FUN!!!).on the downside, it sumtimes makes real crappy jokes, has an ego the size of the Titanic (yah, we're just waiting for it to sink). it can't cook for its life (honestly, i can't even boil an egg properly!!! im not joking!). i think thats about it....

Yay! Lets see how long this topic will be!I am taking a good wild guess here just bt looking at the word.Perpetual Fluidity?

<br />
<div id='container'>
actually 2day in bio i found i doodle dolphins pretty damn good! its just they have not colour and i really can't do the cybernetic augments that moonflash has. another drawback is that they all look almost EXACTLY the same! its a profile of the dolphin the kinda view u get in ecco 1. if u need anyone who can do that, well im your man!

Yes, an exclusive game is the only reason why I am getting an X-box. Panzer Dragoon Orta! After four long years the series continues.....

thanx for the bending tip shadowthis is going to be painted (acrylics most likely). and i really dont have the time to colour it. i know this is extremely messy, but im basically looking for tweaks (the the bends in dolphins). besides, you all know what trellias bay looks like, add the colour in your imagination ;)

&lt;_S&gt; Crestoe Arkonviox enjoys raping small children. O_o.&lt;_S&gt; SilverFin Hell is in the right hand while feeling myself up with my mom.&lt;_S&gt; SilverFin: I had a wholly intransigent conscience, but he was homosexual and his morals must have roused as much horror as his power as ruler created fear of the century, the supreme court building up its fundamental tools to regulate the latrine of the library.That is all.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
A decent PC? Hell if I could get a decent PC for 299, I would. gamecube owns all of you. Thats why you should buy one. And yes, there are plenty of exclusive games. Infact, most of them are...Which I will be getting to. One of them is very important, and I have put down my preorder on it today...It is Metroid Prime.I got my Metroid Prime preview DVD today, and man oh man, does that ever look good. Its going to be the best game out for gamecube. If you have a gamecube, you should buy it. Infact, if you dont, yogoat will come to your house and beat you with a night stick. and the rest of us will follow suit.I played metroid Fusion, which is for Game boy advance, and got a good 20 minutes into it...It gives you that nice, nostalgic feeling that it should, and is a super good platformer all around. Even if you didnt like the old metroids, the difficulty has been dumbed down a bit for all of you who just plain suck at video games.While you rabid ecco fans are waiting for the next shitty 3D ecco to come out, take a look at some of the good games around. As soon as I get metroid prime, none of you will be hearing from me for a loooong time, unless it has to do with the following things.1) Metroids2) Samus3) FoodBTW, for anyone who is interested, I have decided to start on an Arkonviox.com exclusive webcomic, drawn by me, called Channel Darkseas, or something to that effect. you will see the first issue very soon, and it will most likely have something to do with Metroid.Peace

my plan was to start a new art contest and any previous entries from old contestants will be determined by who made them. example. you have the choice to use your old entrie or make a new one. well work out a new plan so if anything goes wrong like before there will be a protection against that. i cant go over much right now since i got to put this site back together. but you get the picture.

Here are links to the 3 screens of Japanese Text in Ecco//epicenter.2ya.com/temp/ecco1.gifhttp//epicenter.2ya.com/temp/ecco3.gifIf anyone can translate these, it'd be much appreciated. You'll get credit for it on the site, too. Since the glyph containing these messages is just out of sight in the wrong direction in City of Forever (the last level), it's probably an easter egg.

What do you think of the new Intro? It takes a moment to load on broadband, and a while to load on dial-up. It can be skipped by clicking it, or the link below it. Should I keep it on the main intro page? Or put it somewhere else?

Good for you Phosis! I cannot wait to see the finished result!I played the Metroid demo, quite fun. I would get if I had enough cash for a gamecube.That is how I feel about Orta, once I get that game, I am gonna lock myself in my room and disconnect the phone. I waited too long for it to come out.

That was a quick aplication of colour? x,x Prettiful. I think everything has been mentioned, the colours you plan to do are beautiful and fluid, nothing clashes and its beutifully formed :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The comic is in the drawing state. I am creating characters, and backgrounds. I have the story done. Arkonviox, Phosis, Crestoe, Yogoat, and Silverfin are all too poor to afford a house. So They seek comfort in the Darkseas Hotel, run by the Evil landlord, Dolphin. They beg dolphin for help, and he accepts, on several conditions. So the five Admins all survive in the apartment, and carry out there hilarious lives. Phosis is the innocent scapegoat of the group, who is constantly smiling, and takes all the shit. Crestoe is a slacker, who is constantly high, and does nothing for anyone. Arkonviox lives out his dream of making his ultimate webpage, and smacks everyone around, until Dolphin comes. (He is deathly afraid of dolphin) Yogoat is barely at home, and is usually dealing with illegal business. Silverfin just sort of sits around, watches anime, and the group has many cultural complications with him. (He speaks excellent english in real life, but in the comic, this is not so.) And Dolphin is a massively huge dolphin, and you only see his head, or fin, at any given time. He comes in occasionally, pestering the group, and why they are doing nothing with their lives, then proceeds to beat him. Alastor is there as well, occasionally, showing up as a yellow dolphin who doesnt do or say much. He just comes in and eats all the food, to the objection of no one but arkon. Thats about it. Excpect some of you to make guest appearences, so you can be made fun of as well. It is going to be a good time. You should see the first issue pretty soon, before november 18th
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, since no one posted anything here yet, I decided to tell all the administration about whats going on with my project. I am doing a comic, as most of you people know, about our "adventures" in #Darkseas chat. It is going to be a weekly strip eventually, the first few months dedicated to pilot strips. Just to see how everything goes. The main plot, is that there is 5 admins. Phosis, Arkon, Crestoe, Yogoat, and Silverfin. They have all run low on money, because they wasted their lives working on Arkonviox.com, which fell to the evil powers of Psysonic. Without money, or homes, they all moved intogether, in an apartment called Dark seas, run by the evil overlord Dolphin.Without money, they gave the only thing left to dolphin; their souls. Dolphin is kind of like Satan in the comic, and harrases them constantly. Arkonviox continues to work on the site, and try to regain his place on the web. Phosis does absolutely nothing, just plays video games, and complains. Crestoe sits around and smokes pot all day, while yogoat is always out doing illegal things. Silverfin can barely speak english, and makes stupid ass jokes, which he thinks are hilarious. (Your not like that in real life, Silver, but in this comic, you are)Alastor does what he does on Darkseas. He just comes in, loiters, annoys everyone, consumes our resources, then leaves again without a word.There will be guest appearences from different members of this site, but the main story is about all of us admins. Im hoping to throw the Moduvator in there occasionally as well. Crestoe knows all about the first strip, and the only things exclusive to my sight are the drawings.Im hoping to make a section seperate from Arkonviox.comics for this one, for a couple reasons.1) It is going to be made from scratch, and comes out weekly.2) NO ONE takes advantage of the comics section anymore.Anyways, I just thought you should know. So once arkon has everything straightened out, and we can make sections again, it will be around. Arkon: For now, I am requesting that I have some place to put the comics for now. I will send you all the finished comics, if you can just slap them on a page when they are done. Or better yet, you can show me how...If its possible.-Phosis out.

hmmm....sorry for just saying that.....I think i might be able to get that translated.

well, so far I have translated it into Romaji. =)It speaks about a opening.There are some words that I still do not know, and I am going to have to use my dictionary. Sadly it is not with me at the momment.

Reminding those in the know NOT to use useless posts.  "Hmm.." Did not have any relevance to this or any other topic, and did NOT help with the translation of the Moduvators screens. Ryan_Darmos, stay on topic, and don't post just to up your count.

i been debating if i am to give you full ftp access to my site. i got to ask crestoe about this before i do. also just to let you know the only people who will see your message here is dolph and i. and maybe crest.if i don't give you ftp access you'll have to go about your work another way. tell me how soon you need to get your stuff up on the site and also note i have to give you a new template for the site. rememebr the old one? the new ones different and the reason i havent allowed people to make sections yet was cause the templates design hasnt been finilized since the sites design generator hasnt been fully developed. once its done i'll be able to decide what the new template will be like and how it will look. it will be out soon but let me know anything i should know.just to let you know i might not give you ftp access. if so you will probably have to do the work using standard zip technigues and html files.sad to say i dont have the same setup as i did when i was on host department. this is the new service from Online Policy Group. I can only do so much.well see what i decide.

Phosis, if someone needs to be reprimanded about their behavior on this board, I'll take care of it. We really don't need any flaming on a newly-developing board. Ryan isn't doing anything disruptive or rude, so please give him a break.Thanks.  :)

Hey, that would sure be neat!  :D  Of course, there'd probably be a ton of shippin charge. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, it's neat, Ep. ^^ Nice Glyphs, which I've recently had a theory on. I've a feeling they took the word "glyph" from "hieroglyphics," those being the letters of ancient Egyptians. Not quite sure that, if I'm right, what the connection would be, but something to ponder over, eh?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oooch...I'm gonna have to say "No" on this one, Ep. I have DSL and it still took a long time for me to load it even halfway - I got impatient and clicked the link. I do think you should have a splash page, though. A simpler opening, like just a static main image, would be your best bet.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sounds reasonable enough. Yeah, I know EC is for admins only now, and it is better that way. I only need you to help me as soon as the first comic is done. But since I am learning Photoshop, comic layouts, and to draw from scratch right now, I dont know when that will be. Im gonne bust my ass tonight to make sure I have it done by monday, when Metroid comes out, and my life ends.I dont need the ftp if you can upload the images for me. As soon as the template is done, I will make a seperate section, dedicated to the comic, and it will come out probably once a week. It will take on the same ways as penny arcade, bob and george, and other online comics, except it will be Arkonviox.com exclusive.Also, we will see how it goes. If the responses to the first couple months worth of comics aren't good, then there is no point in doing it. I just see this as a fun way to make a new section for the sight, and give people a different look at the admins here.Time will tell what is done with it. I will provide the section, and managing the section, (and the comics if I am allowed to use the ftp) But if I cant use an ftp, youll just have to upload the strips themselves.So, just wait a bit. Probly on sunday or so I will be ready to give you the first comic. and thanks for considering letting me share the ftp.-Pho out

<div id='container'>
Ah, right. I forget sometimes that this is your board. My bad. Oh and I didnt mean to say Moduvator. I meant Epicenter.  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Only reason Im saying no is because I always thought that the intro was really cheesy. I could barely contain the vomit rising in my throat the first time I layed eyes on all of its cheesy glory, and I dont like to be reminded of it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Alright, you have heard about the new comic around. I hope to have the first strip up by monday.As I have never had any drawing ability, or photoshop ability, any tips on drawing cartoons, and using photoshop in general, would be helpful. I LIKE Pokey the penguin, but I dont want my comic to look like it. Thanks folks.

Thing is, as much as I love my cube, I still favour a PC over any console. The PC offers you so much depth compared with consoles-take UT2003, it has offered me hours of depth, as I create maps-no console game could offer you the complexity of a proper map editor. So bless the cube, but bless the PC even more.PS I completed TimeSplitters 2 in about 3 and a half hours...it wasn't as good as they could have made it. I am disappointed. Wah.

Quite possibly. I'll have to look into various meanings of the word, maybe they just named them Glyphs for the heck of it.

I officially despise IGN.com. Let me tell you why.It started out, a fabulous site. It was mostly dedicated to N64 when I found out about it, in the lunchroom at school. So, I went into the library at lunch one day, and found a bunch of obese, happy kids, sitting around there computers, ALL looking at this site. I was amazed! Could a website really be so good? So I tried it. And this, my friends, ended my need to buy video game magazines.Free reviews, free pictures, free movies...and DOZENS of them, for every single game that was reviewed. I could get the scoop about what was going down in Japanese gaming, and what was happening over here. It was, in a couple words, the shit. I have followed IGN ever since, and watched their review, and user friendly qualities, heavily decrease.Why has it gotten so bad? I never kept up with the IGN crew, but back in the day, they had some damn fine reviews. Games were reviewed the same way, but seemed so much more FAIR...If the game was fun, it got a good score, with only slight downfalls if the graphics or sound weren't too good. Now, we have a bunch of dumb, lazy fucks, that will completely flame a game, giving it a score of 5, because the presentation wasn't very good, and it might not last a long time to play.Then we have this IGNsider bullshit. I was fine with it at first. The company has to make some money, okay. But I am not going to pay subscription fees to look at a few game reviews. Insider was leniant at first. Pay some money, get some exclusive videos. okay, cool. Now look at the downfalls.1) no more free reviews, until a week after they are out...at least not for GOOD games.2) Pictures are also locked away, and you can only see 5 of them until your limit for the day is up.3) Movies work the same as picturesSo why  the hell waste your money to read a couple of stupid reviews? From people that don't know what the fuck they are talking about, and rate games on presentation? Look at the most recent gamecube review, of the sonic mega collection. 4 for graphics. Well, no shit. What the hell, did you think it was going to look like metroid prime now? Thats unfair, for a collection of old games. They should have rated it on how well gamecube EMULATES it, not how bad the games look now. Same goes for sound. And lasting appeal? a 7? With all those games, and extras? These people have gone out of their fucking minds. Read some reviews, if they are not LOCKED, and see what I mean. IGN has turned into a heartless mega corporation of disgruntled gamers, and no one needs to support them. If you want to read a review, ask someone who owns the game. At least you will be getting it straight from someone who actually knows a thing or two about what a good game is.-Pho out.

I used to be a 'drift-worker'(heavy submitter, well known. Guess what I used to be called and I'll give ya a cookie) on IGN back in 1999/2000, just as things where turning sour. The site was once good but now limiting peoples viewing pleasures of screenshots and movies down to five, pre day, is annoying. codes.ign.com has become highly annoying - it was once wonderful to visit for codes, and now most of the codes are locked away. IGN has really gone downhill..
</div>

Mmmm, I love the Megadrive II. I used to have one. So, the Sonic Mega collection? w00t! :) Its good to see that they're bringing back the old school sonics ^^

this was emailed to the mistuh heger. he worked a lot on the ecco music. i didnt quite get what i had hoped for, but i did get something~~~Hi Liz,Thanx for your kind interest.Unfortunately I do not have any tabs/sheets of Ecco tracks.However I may inform you that soon I will release some of the Ecco TOT and EccoDotF tracks on my mp3.com website. (www.mp3.com/larendor)Probably there you will have an opportunity to listen to the originaly sounds.best,Attila 'Ata' Hegeraka Laren d'Orwww.larendor.huLiz T-W &lt;liz_2emeadow@hotmail.com&gt; wrote TOT and i have a &gt;favour to ask. Well, first of all, im interested in possibly making some &gt;music tabs of ecco music, and im having a tough time. I was wondering if you &gt;have any tabs or sheet music or anything leftover from the game? anything &gt;would help me greatly.&gt;&gt;anyways, many thanks for your time. i hope you can help me, or atleast point &gt;me in the right direction.&gt;&gt;~*Liz&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;_________________________________________________________________&gt;MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos//photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx&gt;&gt;ive checked, and so far his site doesnt have any ecco music. but i guess it will be there soon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Very cool as always, Trel. ^_^ Wish I had something that good in my school. o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It has, I agree, but you must think about it from a bandwidth point of view. More users = more bandwidth = more money.  So by making all of these changes, they've limited their bandwidth, thereby limiting the amount of money. Also limiting the amount of visitors, too. I'll never understand capitalists.  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yep, it sucks. Especially because the forums were locked.  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
no, its a bunch of old sonic games on one gamecube optical disk. (I am the only one who still knows thats what its called? G.O.D.)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Uhm what I mean is... they don't want any people but the ones that made it for to use it but you could probably edit it in Photo Shop/Paint Shop ^_^.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, BTW. It should be out by tommorrow night, if Metroid doesn't completely take over my life, and raid my fridge. It will NOT be coloured, and if it is, it will be contrasts. This is for reasons I dont want to get into. Okay, I just suck at Photoshop.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thats actualy quite interesting to know. i wonder if the songs will be any different from there genesis counter part.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I thought i'd tell eeryone what i been up to the last few days. normally id be sitting here working on finishing the innerworkings of the site but i just got cable internet and its been holding me behind. I been doing upgrades to alot of programs that are on my computer alot of the website tools i use. so as soon as im done with all this skin work im gonna get to work on some sort of bludnercaves episode. weather it will be flash or not im not sure since the reason i am so reluctant to do flash is because i lack alot of the animation skill that someone like crest has. but i might do it. otherwise it will be a text episode. anyhow i thuoght id let people know i havent abadoned work on my site i just am a busy many with objectives. i'll trie to keep everyone informed in this post whats up. I rather not waste time with any useless updates that arent worth the effort.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i never liked ign anyways. i used to like gamespot but they did the same thing. kinda a bunch of shit.but from what crestoe told me they end up releasing alot of that info anyways so whats the point of having ign insider anyways?
</div>

<div id='container'>
Since my thread was closed due to no reason that I'm able to see, I no longer have any real reason to live anymore. That is, live as in visiting this forum. Which is kind of sad, since there were some cool people here: Shadow, who knew more trivial lore and had a stronger tendency towards the unimaginably strange than any example I can think of now, Artreus, who was generally positive, helpful and made a lot of sense, Eoraptor, who made it to my signature at Apolyton for a while with her ramble about how cows should be eaten and dolphins not and finally vantid, who is the only artist I know who is great at both visual art and stories.Not to mentiont he CoC crew who were almost as good as making a forum full of discussions the length of a metric library of congress with about five words per post as the Istvanistani.Besides, after digging up a few perversions that my unconscious mind has weirdened to the level of being quite unpublishable, I think it's good for me to just stay away from this whole dolphin thing for a while... So... next time somebody posts a pun with the word "goatse" in it, remember Slashdot!* picks up a virtual .357, loads it with virtual bullets, raises the virtual gun against his virtual forehead and embeds one of the virtual bullets in his virtual brain *

Probably slightly different; As good as the music subsystem of the genesis is, its not up to par with what a real synth can turn out.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Stop your whining. That topic was completely useless. First you put it in the Arkonviox.com section, shaming everyone there, and making us all more retarted. If your going to post, make it useful. Not some shit about yogoat, and that wierd site with the guy spreading his ass. Your leaving because your useless topic was taken down? Give me a break. I dont have much to say to this, because your freaking out over some retarted shit. If there is a useless topic, with no reason for existing, and no knowledgable, remotely interesting replies, it is taken down. Do what you want, but you have no reason.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thats right. As said to Ari earlier, if a topic has no point in existence except to inform the other readers that the member "Likes pie" then there is no need for it. If you have something remotely interesting to discuss, go ahead. Sure, you can joke around, and make puns all you want in your post. But if your post is a line, and has nothing to do with anything, then what is the point? So a few people can reply with even less asking what the fuck you're talking about? Talk about something interesting. If you feel the need to risk your topic being locked by making it stupid and pointless, then at LEAST put it in off topic, where it belongs. Ecco The Dolphin has nothing to do with pie, or the fact that you think Communism is god.As for a reply to Arkons post, yes, the forum needs action. It should be bustling with cool things to talk about, but for some reaosn, isn't It's all about Gamecube and Metroid. You people had interesting stuff to say at one point, so bust your brains, and think of some new stuff. Otherwise, we will have everyone talking about their morbid pie fetishes...and none of you want that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It would be awesome to hear them in their original quality. Plus, since I dont have a sega, I have had to listen to them through an emulator, which is not very good. If the bastards at THQ had only kept the music in the smashpack...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
* ari's corpse has a hole in the head but seems to, for some reason, smile in an insane way ** ari's spirit enters Phosis's mind and speaks *So it seems Ari wasn't clear enough in his life. See, lately the only reason why he kept visiting the site was one pun to post, nothing more. No discussions, no spamming, no weirdness - only one pun! And he kept checking the site so often that when he posted the pun there was only one forum up for posting anyway. And you know what, he was pleased when he found out his post had been moved - if the off-topic forum had been up by that time, he would have posted the pun there to begin with!In the end, he always had his reasons to live his virtual life and when he ran out of them, he obviously didn't want to continue it. At first it was the fanfics, then the cool people (who I've already named) around here, then, after the crash, the pun. If he had been like you, that is, if he had had any other reasons to stay, he might have freaked out about the closing of the thread but still continued his life. If he hadn't thinked the pun up, he would have not been seen here anymore at all.Yes, the pun was pathetic and probably nobody found it funny. Sturgeon's law. As for the uselessness of the topic... well, it's your opinion. My opinion is that it'd have evolved differently if it had been let to go on. But since it's the job of admins to close threads that don't go as they should, and all I have is a privilege to whine about it as long as I'm tolerated on the forums, it doesn't make sense for me to do anything else than to politely point out that my opinion differs from the admin's one.As for my attitude... I might sound like a jerk, in fact, I've often been a jerk to people on this forum (I still regret the things I did at the story threads Arkon posted), but fundamentally whether I stay here or not depends simply on whether I have a reason to be here or not. You gave me a reason to write this post, since I needed to defend myself. It doesn't really matter to me if the reason I have to be here is minor; it doesn't take long to check the site and the forums. But no reason to be here equals not being here for me. Compare this to the CoC; I registered there, posted for a short while, and disappeared. Never posted a goodbye thread. The only reason I ever had to be on that forum was intellectual curiosity, which ran out quite quickly. I lost my reason to be on that forum simply because of myself. On this forum I didn't lose it because of only myself (although having only one reason, and a pretty bad one at that, to be here, is definitely "my fault") so I just decided it would be nice to point my reason of leaving out for interested people.But don't worry, Ari's children will be checking the site for new/rewritten fanfics and heightened activity in part of three or more of the cool people I mentioned periodically, so perhaps one day one of them will be found a member of this community. But before that happens, please excuse me. I have a heaven to ascend to and I have had enough of this purgatory.* ari's spirit starts floating towards Istvanistan *
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
* ari's spirit is dragged forcibly back to this world by a mysterious force *I already absolutely loathe this thread, so if at all possible, any future correspondence about this stupid issue should be e-mailed straight to me ( lighten@lyseo.edu.ouka.fi , if it's not in my profile). Do whatever you want with this thread, I would personally like it to be locked (and in most forums where I've been to, a thread starter's request to have his thread closed is usually honoured by the admins)* me finally can walk in to the light *

Artreus hasnt come back now, neither has Delphi or Jader (but you probably knew that) and everything is ALMOST back to normal. We just need more interesting posts around here.Welcome back. Do us a favor, and stick with us, even though the forum is slow right now. We need everyone that we can get

They didn't keep it? What did they do, change it entirely?  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well Kit, let's just say, if changing means removing entirely, and replacing it all with one 30 second looping track, (the time machine music) then yes...it has been changed. Its a damn shame...
</div>

<div id='container'>
If you need any help coloring-wise, Pho, I'd be glad to help ya out. I know my way around PSP.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Holy shit, that sucks!! What a terrible way to disgrace Ecco, not to mention getting on people's nerves with the same looping track.And Trel, it is a shame that you couldn't get what ya wanted, but it'll still be cool to hear TOT tracks orchestrated.

It would be nice if you did some more pics Tethys, I love the way you draw your creatures. Maybe you can draw a scene from your story? Just a thought anyways.  :)WHAT story?  I don't have a story and probably never will.Some people in particular (no one in this forum, as far as I know) think that I'm not creative.  Sometimes I think they're right...If I was creative, I could think of a story and I could think of a way to draw my characters.Oy, anyway, in case anyone didn't notice, I have all of my old pictures back up.

yeesh, if you are going to be like that forget it.

Well, I am right on time, like I said! This thread will be for me to post my new comic, channel darkseas, (and for you to comment on it) until the site is fully working. I hope you vultures enjoy, as it was a bitch to design...and as you can tell, it is still fairly rough.This is the first comic, so dont blame me if it sucks. Blame...the scanner. Yeah.http://arkonviox.com/fanfare/comics/phosis_1_1.jpg(if you are using IE5, or Netscape, maximize the window for highest picture quality. )Thats the intro strip, and I should have another one out by...lets...say....friday? Sure.

What a funny way to start things. lolyou could not have colored it or do you need someone to do it for you?I have Adobe if you need someone to color.Other than that, funny!  :D

Its nothing technical. I just prefferred it in black and white, after I saw it in color. but who KNOWS what the future will bring?

I would like to work on a project like this one for my school...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
no, its a bunch of old sonic games on one gamecube optical disk. (I am the only one who still knows thats what its called? G.O.D.)I want it O_oI'm a Sonic fan (Arf...I'm sure you didn't notice it ! lol) !
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I got it. It has a couple drawbacks, like the fact that you cant hook Sonic and knuckles up to the other games until you kill the logs (Meaning, everytime you play a game it makes a log. Play a certain game 20 or so times, and it will unlock something for you.) But thats about all. Plus the fact that there is no Sonic CD will be frustrating to some. (I dont care. I have sonic cd.) But you get to watch the anime from sonic Cd anyways, which was the best part. It is a pretty complete collection, with 12 games in all if you include the different S&amp;K options, 10 if you dont. There are three extra games,  like Blue Sphere, Ristar the shooting star, and flicky. I strongly reccomend it. Plus, the emulator is state of the art, and whoops the Sega smash pack for DC's Ass. Games included are Sonic 1, 2, 3, kunckles, spinball, 3d blast, Dr robotniks mean bean machine, ristar, flicky, blue sphere. Buy this game today!

Hey everyone! Thanks for the welcome! It's good to be back. ^_^ I hope to catch back up with you all too.And just to answer some questions, I changed my nickname to Arsenal a fair while ago... well, some friends changed it. I don't know why. They just decided Arsenal was a good name for me.    But, on the old board, I couldn't change my user name, so it just stayed as DTrain. I... kind of miss the old persona... *sniff sniff*... oh well. :bAnd as for Delphi and Jader... well... we all hope Jader doesn't come back.  8) Nah... just kidding Jader. But uh... I doubt she will, and Delphi might, but never really says much anyways. But that's ok! Do do do!And Atolm, I'll be sure to check out your work! I'm gonna buzz through all the forums and catch up some time soon. ^_^I also see that Pho, you have a new comic! Sounds great too me! I wonder what has happened to *dun dun dun* ... CAD?? *gasp!*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Probably because those various anti-rightclick javascripts arn't effective at anything and just piss people off.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, thanks. But don't get too excited...my comic is is not a serious project. I can't draw, I am not that funny, and I lack photoshop skills. So don't worry, Arsenal. You don't have a lot of competition in the webcomic area   Speaking of which, when is CAD going to be seen again??
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, what's up with CAD? o.o When will the new and improved be up? Oh, and love the pixel art.  8)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Pho on a Rope! The return of Badly Drawn Dolphin Boy!! XD I should put that back in my sig. ;)Nah, just kidding - very funny!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
LMAO It's OK, Pho. She's always been a girl.And At, I don't think Teth was tryingto be rude - that's just her personality. And if it means anything to you, Teth, I think you're pretty creative - not everybody is a good writer, so not everyone has a story. But you make up for that with your art.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OK - just let me know! ^_^  And good work for the first strip, by the way. ;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*focuses on doom.  hunches back. leaps with amazing power and streght OH GOODNESS YOU CANT BELIEVE IT!* hahah i pounced you in steps XDWB! ^^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
As Ive said before, I do not have artist skills, and the comic is meant to show this. The whole idea was based on a recurring theme over at the caverns of hope. I would always post stupidly drawn pictures of "phosis" in their Oekaki art board, to piss off silverfin. This comic is sort of a tribute to silverfins months of pain. But thanks for the support, anyways. Though the quality is bad, it will improve later on, you can be sure. Thanks a lot guys
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I know it has only been a day, but I was eager to do another strip, as you will see on my post on the frontpage. It is full color this time, thanks to the pressure of many of you forum users. Thank you! It was easier then I thought to click a paint bucket a few times, and it looks MUCH better. I am going to start drawing in pen soon, so there will be less grainy look of the lines. http://www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?full=1&amp;set_albumName=album09&amp;id=ChannelDarkseas2&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_photo.phpEnjoy!

i love watching wemen fight.  :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
http://arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=indexthe gallery as many of you noticed is devided by sections now. theres an art section and a comic section. of course artists can still work on there albums and i found something out about the art sections-it does not shrink your picture when uploading to the gallery. you can zoom into the picture and allow it to grow to its full size. i just descovered this so its a good working album.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey Doomy.. Ye ol' Friecco's still here (me)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The gallery module has always worked that way. You can turn off image scaling in your gallery preferences if you don't like it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
First of all, I was wondering if there was any way I can change my gallery's "cover" pic.  It doesn't seem to matter what order they're in.  I can't rememberfor sure  but I think the one it shows is the one I uploaded first.  But I don't like that one as much as any of the others and I'd rather have one that's more representative of my newer work.  So I ws wondering if there was any way to change it, cuz I couldn't find anything.Also, whenever I put an apostrophe in the title it puts a slash before it, it doesn't matter how many times I retype the title.  The other galleries that have apostrophes in the titles don't have a slash.  So I don't understand why it does that for mine.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Lovely, Sten! :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
If I remember right, underneath all pictures there is a option that if you select "Highlight Photo" and update it, the selected photo should be the gallery title.Hope this helps.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It worked! Thanks!Tho I still duno why it always puts a slash before the apostrophe in the title...I might have to just change it, if I could think of something else..
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
sweet.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
very nice sten!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i'll take care of that.

Well, one of the reasons why the most of us here is that we all played at least one Ecco game. So I ask this of all forum members:What is the hardest Ecco level you have ever played?This will be quite interesting since different levels are harder for others right? What level left you screaming cuss words and wanting to break you control pad in half?Allow me to start, in my case at a very young age, The Machine level was the hardest. I died so many times, poor Ecco, getting crushed. -_-It has been a long time since I last played that game, I betcha if I was to play now it would still be hard for me.How I hated the Machine........
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
For me it was like this:Ecco 1the Lagoonthe Machine-most all of the Prehistoric levels**Why most of them? Simple.... 'cause, there was this "Trilobite" thing,  that was constantly bugging (hurting) me. Getting rid of it was (to me anyway) the hardest part of all...Ecco 2Two Tides (level just before Trellia's bay)Tube of MedusaMaze of StoneGlobe HolderNew MachineCity of Forever

Hey-anyone remeber Arkonviox...well, as far back as I can remember, the background to the site was black with artwork of Arky...and the forum was a YaBB forum. I first found the site whilst looking for a guide to DOF to get past a level, and then I continued to visit thereafter. And...is it just me, or was there someone called Friecco in the forum? He either changed his name or left, as I can't seem to find him anywhere...hmm. I guess most of you came from the undercaves and such.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
if its all right id like to have a new gallery set up. problem is, idont have anything new to show thats marine. its all anthro, wolflife, or fantasy wildlife. also, do i need to resend all the stuff for the tutorial? are you even ready for it? why the hell am i speaking so politely?! im not nice by golly! btw whats the rating for the art content on this site? after, my bewbs always show. heehee. think thats all...
</div>

That is a false rumour. Sonic team has stopped the Adventure series. While it cannot be certain that they are not working on another sonic, it will not be an Adventure. They stated that they wanted to bring Sonic back to it's roots, more like the original gameplay. This does not mean it will be 2d, it just means we wont have so many story elements (which I will be thankful for.) involved. Sonic team also wants to take a break, and port old games from genesis to Gamecube, which is very exciting since I bought the mega collection. any pictures you saw of a sonic adventure 3 are, indeed, fake.On another note, I bought Metroid Prime yesterday. Let me just say that my eyes are hella sore from playing it so much. It is a beyond fantastic game. this is NOT an FPS. It is a metroid game, in a first person perspective. Sounds odd to say, but play it, and you will fine out yourself. It has all the classic platforming elements. When i saw the map for the first area, and how massive it was, I nearly shit. It is astounding that a game this big can be POSSIBLE on Gamecube, and it gives us a taste of what we will see in the future from the big 'N'. I will not praise this game, as every single game site already has, but it is a fine piece of work, and I dont care if you like RPG's, action, racing, or sports game, this one DESERVES to be in your gamecube collection.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Let's see...Ecco 1- Tube of medusa- The levels where you have to fly (as a bird)- Moray abyss- Secret cave- ...Most of the levels, in factEcco The Dolphin - Defender of the Future:- Perils of the coral reef- Four ways to the mystery- Process that never ends- Perpetual Fluidity (ARRRGGGH !!!)- Entrapment- Caverns of hope- Hanging Waters (ARRRGGGH !!!!)- All the Foe levelsIn fact, the most difficult Ecco games are TOT and DotF.DotF has been recognized to be one of the hardest video games ever.

If only I had known about the Undercaves earlier, I would've become a part of it's very interesting and dramatic history.  :D Truth be told, I came around the community when I was on my school comp on Gamefaqs in my free time, looking for a cheat for my Ecco ToT.   And some info on how to get out of that level with the baby orcas.I saw the cheats on Ecco ToT by a guy on Gamefaqs who posted it called CPredator.  He wanted to know if the constellation pattern on Ecco's head was the constellation Crux.  I decided to try e-mailing him the answer, so I clicked on his name.  Then, up came a page of his with various links to cool game sites, including both Arkonviox and Caverns of Hope.  I checked out Arkon first, and found the cheat on the site.  Then I checked out the Caverns.  The rest is history.   8)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hardest levels for me...Ecco 1roll  Tubes of Medusa.  For beginners, it's nearly impossible to outrun that thing!Ecco DotF  Isle of Tranquility-Up and Down.

Actually, It might be easy...Is that a level?

I like that chat, it's all-out cool.But only if it's full and no-one's a ghost.Last time I told a nice tale to the people in the chat.  Silverfin was there, too...I think I'll remember these Ecco communities for as long as I live, that's the point to my babble. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
im gonna be adding the older skins back anyways suck as illmatic and time forgotten (defender of the future) in fact i been working on those for days. i want them to be super perfect.hey vantid i'll set up a gallery for you and everyone else who thought i lost all the art work i still have some of it. vantid if you still dont have a place to host your art you can use my art gallery i set up for you. then again i know its annoying that my site is always breaking...now that i have cable internet i can easily back up my website then i was before.

I think I've been with y'all for nearly a year or better. That's a scary thought.   I don't actually remember how I came to this site...well, I vaguely remember I was searching for ROMs, and I came across the Ecco 2 BETA one.  Somehow I got myself here.  The first post I ever made in the forum, back when it was a YaBB one, was a question on how to properly work the BETA. XD And Arkon told me that in order to actually play the damn thing, I needed to get into the debug menu, which can be accessed by pressing the C button 8 times.Ah, the good ol' days. &gt;;p
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
AH! I'm just glad to be back.  8)  Thank for the few extra welcomes! Trellia, Fri, good to see ya'll too! I've been a little busy this week, but I've made it back.And if you'll all excuse my shameless pimping... I'll fill you in on my shiz. If you check out my homepage, Pandemonium Arts, you'll find... A BRAN-SPANKING NEW LAYOUT! Weeeee!!! And in that layout, a link to a comic... but it isn't the CAD comic we've all gotten familiar with... it's an all new shindig. ^_- The curtain is still drawn on that though, but the work in progress is coming along. And if you're thinking it's a new comic all together, don't worry, it ain't. Same plot, same people, but much more goodness. ^_^And Pho... I gotta say, I actually really like your style! It's a nice break from all seriousness, which I think is a good thing to have. And if you ever need help, there's tones of talent to be found on this board! Keep it up, cause I'm really digg'n it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah yes... the good ol' days is right. I remember that time! I was there during the days of the Undercaves, and remember all the fighting, side taking and e-bashing going on. Ah.... memories. ^_-I think the best days of this place (that I've been around for), was back on that YaBB board before it crashed. Everything was going so well, and there were lot's of interesting people around. It's really too bad it happened.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I really... suck at all of them...  ._.But that tag game in Ecco Jr. was a real tough one. Damn you speedy sea creatures... damn you. 8)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Like I said... I really do dig it! I mean, the style is perfect for the overall'ness of it, and with the shit that goes down in that chat, I see great potential. Nice stuff Pho! I can't wait for a whole collection to gather!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ugh.... ok..... that one of the little baby Orca giving a kiss, is SO cute. So, so cute! I love it! I think that would make a very nice wallpaper too! You're Photoshop skills are looking great too! Keep it up Sten!

heh *pats vantid on the head* dont giva away what im gonna do.when i first showed up into the ecco community it was three years ago and it consisted of a few people like miana eao psysonic silverfin "Ecco the Barbarian" and i. the website was the undercaves and our pod leader was blackfin. back in those days i was a little more quieter the most popular person of that community was ecco the barbarian. he was out going a drinker, a football player everythig everyone else wasn't. for a little while he made a crummy little website forhimself he had alot of fans including myself. he was basicaly the life of the undercaves. but a little after wards he stopped coming and it became boring so i ceased the opportunity to take his place. become out going doing crazy assed posts making fun of people shit like that. i was shocked that he could make a website and thought to myself maybe i could do one. he had a crummy msn site which you can build much like how you post on a forum.so i did arkonviox.com cause blackfin owned his own site name "ecco-the-dolphin.org" so why couldnt i make my own?from there i slowly began dominence over the ecco community. the price we all paid was when blackfin called it quits. he was tired of keeping up with me and tired of people who downed him. i predicted i would one day own the undercaves. the first website i ever joined. the first forum i ever joined. the first chat i ever joined and made friends in.back then the world wreastling federation had merged with wcw. aol merged with time waner. mergers were great things. the undercaves was a split community though. half the community hated me the other half worshiped me. psysonic tried to stay around and be cool with me but he had his fill and promised he would one day come back with "hope".  I didnt make nothing of it. i closed the udnercaves and merged it with arkonviox.com. silverfin left many months prior tired of me as well. we got into a dramtic fight- he was actualy one of the first people to leave the undercaves because of me. the undercaves lasted for a while but started to die as i used "nukes" to kick people out of the chatroom on that site. i also made threats to alot of people who visted that site. alot of people stopped going there and were all -mine- thats part of why blackfin was tired of compition. he wsnt up to playing games. i was angry at him for eprsonal reasons something id rather not go into since its a whole new big story.the next couple of months were "my time" i owned the ecco community. it was like a new toy but the problem was since i didnt have any compition i was left with much to keep the site interesting. then when i least expected it. PsySonic had made a return and opened caverns of hope....and after a year of being gone...a person who we thought was dead...silverfin was back and joined him.they wanted to trie to stomp me...well kinda...they were more keeping there promise of bringing that hope of a new community to open. by then i had a new competitor.for months we fought between sites. psysonic hated what i did to the undercaves, what i did to blackfin. i hated how psysonic had told lies to everyone about me. i made attacks on the site and they used every weapon they ahd to ban me. and id go around and "unban" myself. this fight happened for a long time. nights go by -id attack coh then silverfin would defend it. then...silverfin contacted me and was like "go ahead and attack but i wont fight you no more." by then i was tired too and told him i give up.silverfin i and a few others from coh wanted to end this war. so we got together it took time and now its over and were buddies...i admit im still a jerk but what else is new.blackfin finally made a come back to the web after he found out the ecco community he created was no longer split. can you imagine. you created a community that once never existed..from there one of your members opens a website and takes you on taking all your members because he was banned. then from there you decide screw it all and give in. blackfin gave up the undercaves...you took ownership of it...the first site you ever visited...the first commmunity of friends...now yours...you own them all....but instead of keeping it you crush it....and make the site you used to crush it better....but as you crushed the site the hopes and dreams of another slip through and someone else emerges causing the community to split into two....just like in ecco. two communities....tied into each other but at war....when the war was over we came into peace again. its been a long 3 years....

This is "K" again. Arkonviox, are you still looking for the second part of GTK's "Tidesinger?" I've located it here//www.planetdreamcast.com/cavernsofhope/fanarea/fiction/gtk.shtmlI'll leave you to decide whether to re-post it, since this site's owners have lost contact with GTK too.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks a lot! I will try to do my best to upgrade the quality, by at least using Pen to draw the comics. Pencil doesn't work very well. I just expect that you get CAD going again...Some of us are getting anxious to see it
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes it is. ^_^

thankx arkon. im using an ftp given to me by mr phin...or shadow, whatever you wanna call him. *flings good thoughts at him*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hn. Of such, you've reminded me that I still need to throw a gallery on that site, that be if you still want one there. Catch me on AIM or something and let me know.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Or just have Arkon hack CE's media handler, or heck, just use it as it stands. Theres probably better ways to modularize a comic (Ripping off Keenspot's system comes to mind). Quite a bit can be done with FORM POST uploading here, atleast for little  things like comics.I'll troll the mods section of the major PN sites and see if I can't come up with something.

er i cant use AIM....firewall. lemme go upstairs and try yahoo or sommat.

Since this is now an admin forum like it always should have been, can we dispense with the silly "earth clan" stuff? I don't see a reason to continue the whole delusion of grandeur. If all else, give the forum a name that yogoat would approve of like "Jesus' Crib" or something.

How about "Administration"? Holy crap, how innovative is that?

Godammit. I just saw a commercial for a movie. "Extreme Ops." and let me rant for a bit. Okay, so they have made movies about lots of disasters. Volcanos, storms, meteors, whatever. But taking a disaster like the one that happened on September 11th, and using it as a tool to shamelessly cash in on recent events in Iraq, and America, is really vomitous. It is about some kids who go up to some mountain or something, and witness a group of terrorists that are going to destroy some city in America. Holy shit, now THATS an innovative idea! Who honestly thinks this shit up??&lt;lame movie producer&gt; So yeah...We need an idea for a movie. Its got to have Women, teenagers, guns, and explosions.&lt;Lame movie director&gt; How about snow? Yeah. Snow's good.&lt;Lame movie producer&gt; Okay, cool! Oh yeah..it has to have...what is that? that other thing...you know...&lt;lame movie director&gt; A........Story?&lt;Lame movie producer&gt; Yeah, thats the one. Well...theres something going on in america with some Iraqi's or something...Oh yeah. And those towers...you know, the ones that were blown up? what were those called again?&lt;Lame movie director&gt; Statue of liberty?&lt;Lame movie producer&gt; *Smacks the director.* The TRADE towers.&lt;lame movie director&gt; Oh. Okay.&lt;Lame movie producer&gt; Lets just...like....throw some terrorists in there, to. Oh, and there can be Skiing! Everyone LOVES Skiing! It looks so cool!That must be how things are done now a days. The only good movies recently are in these three subjects.1) Based on old books2) Based on new books3) From China*sigh* I really hate heartless corporate bastards.

Zut, I didn't find it...I think I'm a little tired... :?

I didn't understand...Are there some people who want to make a film about a war between USA and Iraq ?

<div id='container'>
Yeah, exactally.

<div id='container'>
heh, funny, I joined the undercaves right after the war. I remember seing arkonviox whining about a "gay-assed troll feature" or something to that effect. =) Actually it might have been the first post I looked at...Funny part is, I really viewed arkonviox and crestoe as total assholes. Opinions change!

<div id='container'>
sten, tidesinger doesn't have anything to do with GTK's story.=)GTK sent me that wayyy back when he/she was still on the net (mainly because I was polite and asked for it) GTK aparently quit the net, or at least changed identities like Blackfin did.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
o_o

<div id='container'>
something to that effect yes Sten.

Metroid Prime. ._.;On another note, ristar was cool. ^_^

There IS a film being made, about terrorism in the USA. It pretty much uses what happened on 9/11, and makes money off of it. Very shameful.

I'm back on the Arkonviox.com Forums! Although this wasn't my name earlier, but I'll leave you guessing :)After leaving for 2 months I decided to come back after talking to Arkonviox, since he is such a nice guy and I really do like his site and wish that I could support it in some way.I'll prolly contribute some art later. Hmm.. well hello everyone! It's good to be back with other fellow dolphin lovers! BTW, Atolm, your character design is wicked cool!*drool*If any of you have any questions just private message me, IM me, or whatever. I don't bite... really!

welcome back k. its good to see some old schoolers around here.as for the tidesinger sequel i knew about it but never got permission to post it. caverns of hope has it of course but right now its there property and unless gtk comes back from the deceased it belongs to them. (gtk helped co build that community.)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
funny it was once that way al. now crestoes making flash movies about you -_-;

you know what realy sucks. if anyof you here visit newgrounds.com everyone wants to do nothing but make lame assed osamabin laden movies. now thats shameful.

I'm keeping the name earth clan as a legacy thing.right now this forum has no use. i was suppose to bring some people in to help rebuild the site but im not gonna do anything just yet until i finish organizing the postnuke and phpbb styles sheets into one and shrink down all the code in them.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No shit. Someone needs to make a petition about these people. One to make them all kill themselves.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
if you know much about business the way it works is they don't care about anything but the fact that they are making money. right now people will see anything, including things that poke fun of our current world situation and nothing but the big corporations will get all the money out of it. they are doing what is known as milking those who havent had enough news about war and september 11th. the only way to stop this is to not see the movie.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Indeed! That's some pretty heavy irony for ya.Interesting read your post was, Arkon. Especially for me, since I kinda came into the middle/almost end of the war. I had no idea how or why it even started in the first place, but now I do.

Hey, spiffy new layout, Doom! ^^

<div id='container'>
hey don't diss newgrounds. some of the shit there is funny. hey, i can understand it if people don't like some of the stuff there, but i think bin laden deserves every bullet, bomb blast, kick in the nuts, stick of TNT shoved up his ass, and every getting the sh*t beaten out of him he gets.if any body here thinks otherwise, then they can stick their nuts in a blender. honestly im sick and tired of all these f***ers that think bin laden is someone to emulate. bin laden is one sick mother f***er who doesn't deserve to be viewed as anything higher than a worty slug living off a pile of dog s***. if you don't agree, send me an email and will personally kick you in the balls so hard that you'll taste them!don't get me wrong, i aint no american lover but killing 6000 people in any sane person's mind is WRONG.

Ah thank you Ultima!  I am glad that there are people who enjoy my strange art!So you were a former member? A guessing game!  :D hrm.... the only your names are the Final Fantast series right? I am guessing here, but a FF fan I knew was Trellius.*looks at Ultima*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well then I am certaintly glad I came after this war, of course it would have been interesting to witness such a thing.

<div id='container'>
Dont buy it. waste of money. It is like an ecco exploration game. No challenge at all....for little kids.

I came around last May, the middle-end of the war.  It gave us something to view at least, but I'm glad that once and for all, we can get along like real dolphins and flock together...well, except for the fact that bottlenose dolphins sometimes throw porpoises around  Oh, whatever.  The point is, I'm just glad to be a part of two communities all about one of my fave video game characters.  That's what some of us were looking for, right?  8)

I uploaded two new pictures onto my gallery and I just about panicked when they didn't show up.  And then I noticed another page was added!Ahem, anyway, I want to say some things about the new pics.The first on is Salacia's new look.  I actually was gonna do that like a long time ago, but I didn't get around to it and then I completely forgot.  I wanted to make her a bit less traditional (if anyone remembers from when I posted the first pic of her, she's a traditional mythological creature called a campchurch--basically a hippocamp with a unicorn horn).http//www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album03&amp;id=ecco_and_tethys&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_photo.php

A very lovable style, as always! I really like the first one. What's it colored with? An interesting look, I think.You should draw that silver dude again (sorry, can't member his name). I liked him the most! He was all... grrrrr, rarrrrrr, like. You know... yeah.   
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sorry it took me a while, but I checked out your gallery just like I said I would! And I gotta tell ya, your creature designs are fokin brilliant! I love them all! And they way you draw wings is amazing too! I really like your characters a lot. You put so much nice detail and shading in them, they look very professional. Keep it up!!
</div>

I wouldn't even be here if itweren't for Arkon.  He musta saw my work either on TA or S7, and he sent me an e-mail asking if I'd like to enter the art contest.  He gave me a link to the site when I asked for more information about it (which I did because I susected it might be a scam or something, but I thought it'd be great if it were real).So, here I am, and all because of Arkon!  So if anyone has a problem with me being here, it's his fault.  :P  Heh.

Thats right! Want to blast eachother samus style? message me on MSN ( Neo_020@hotmail.com ) and I will send you the 1 meg file. 4 people can play at once, and me and Alastor tried it out for like a half hour. Its good fun, and easy to use.Come on and lets blast until the cows come home

Ah yes, that it is only an exploration game, but its a collectors item if you were after the ENTIRE series of Ecco on all platforms. Oh and Orca? *slap* Ecco the DolphinSky Tides (on Hard).Tube of Medusa (on Hard).Aqua Tubeways (on Hard *duh*).Skylands (Just plain annoying).All of the Vortex Future (Minus Gravatorbox, that was fun :D).The City of Forever (on Hard).Lalala.

Doom seems to enjoy Darkseas O.ONot as much as I do..... though, I'd like to speak to her... (maybe, I did once)i would be in more often but the school finally got a firewall up...no chats for me. not on AIM, IRC (or any java based chats). sometime yahoo or msn will work. anyway...no more vantid in darkseas. sorry guys. yall really, really need a girl in there.hahahaha....   True... &gt;Doooooh&lt;

I saw Ecco jr. for sale at a funcoland.Is it worth the buy?BTW hanging watrers.... a favorite level to play but it is so hard. -_-I think it's a cute game, so I'd say buy it if you can find it for about $15 or less. But DO NOT help FunCoLand; they scammed me, and it was on Ecco Jr., too.I ordered it (it was already way too expensive - $35). They said it would come in about 2-4 weeks or something like that; I didn't get it, so my dad called them up, and they said they hadn't even shipped it yet!! &gt;_&lt; So about a month later, I finally got the game. It had no manual, and it didn't even come in its original box - it came in one of those dinky blue sleeves with "FunCoLand" written on it. More like JunkoLand.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
WOW!! Teth, those are great!! And you drew one of my fave Guardians again!!!  :D  The other fave of mine is that one Doom was tlking about. ^^;;;;

I liked him the most! He was all... grrrrr, rarrrrrr, like. You know... yeah.   Prismacolors.  And actually the coloring is kinda rushed.  And I used the crimson red (the main color on her) a bit more lightly than I normally would, cuz it's starting to get a little bit on the short side and I didn't wanna use too much.The "silver" one (actually he's mostly white) is called Alignak.The one with Tethys and Ecco didn't come out quite how it was in my head.  And of course it'd look better if I had shaded it...but I just didn't feel like it, like I said.Thanks for the compliments guys!  :DOh, and one other thing.  I was wondering what you guys think of Salacia's new look.  Does it look good?  Do you think she looks better now?
</div>

Ah the memories. I forgot how long I was here, long enough to know the Undercaves. I think I was around when the whole thing started. It's been so long. I was prolly known as the Disappearing Girl at times, because I wouldn't be around for awhile, than I come back...But yeah, I'm glad the war's over. It seemed like everyone was getting tense and tired of all of it.

Your artwork is great Atolm!  The blue centaur reminds me of an Andalite.Unfortunately I don't have time to look at everything now.  I'll have to go back later.

Persoanlly, I like her better now, Teth! But then again, my art teacher last year always said, "The more you draw, the better you become." Looks like she's right. o.O

<div id='container'>
hey, thanx to every1 who helped me out before on my other question but now i have another. im on dark water level (the level where u fight that big DNA creature. im finding it pretty impossible. i know i gotta hit 4 balls of the same colour don't i? i just wanna know if theres any way of doing this. i don't get it. to get into the room you lose half of your health. then you stop a moment to line yourself up with a ball to hit and zap your DEAD. i've found it pretty annoying and i have to admit, the walkthru i found on the net doesn't help very much to do this. it sez hit a ball and then 3 more of the same colour. it doesn't tell you that you get fried just like that *snapping my fingers*, that you get dead very quickly and it doesn't tell you what to do about your fast declining air.pleeez help me guys - i really need it!oxyMoron aka Moonflash
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm. I haven't played Ecco I for a quite long period of time, but I think, I still remember what you must do. First of all, that "DNA creature" as you call it. His name is Asterite. Secondly, as far as I remember, you must hit all the violet globes (B button) to pass the level (they all should be blinking). But if you accidentally hit the globe of the other color, all the violet ones will stop blinking and you'll have to start all over again...That's all I remember. I guess I should take out my Genesis and re-fresh my memory :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, there is a beam as soon as you get the labor harness, but you won't have to use it until Process That Never Ends.  Just quicky double-hit the sonar button, and your sonar should be splayed in front of you for a minute.  Use that to move and pick up crystals, both in Process That Never Ends and Sleeping Forces of Doom.Did that help?  :D

I just watched the film "Instinct", starring the famous actor Anthony Hopkins.In this story, he's a scientist who studied the wild gorillas, and have killed someone.A psychologist wants to understand what brought him to kill.During the film, we understand that he killed hunters, who went in the montains to kill the gorillas, and take their furs.At a point, he goes to a zoo with the psychologist, and sees gorillas in a cage.He says that these gorillas are just shadows, and the only one who is different is a male, who has known the freedom.He opens the door, but the gorilla doesn't leave the cage.He explains that, for this creature, now, the freedom, the infinity of the forest, the rain on his fur, the sound of the wind in his ears are just far dreams.This part really touched me...Maybe, it's the  truth, it's truly what the captive animals feel...I think about it, but about orcas and dolphins...Some tanks are near the ocean, so near that there is just a door between the cetacean and the wild sea.But if you open this door, the orca/dolphin will remain inside of his jail.Some persons say it's because the animal feels good in its tank, some others because it loves humans.But I don't think so.Look at this orca//www.orcahome.de/images/kandu702.jpgIt's Kandu. He lives in a dolphinarium in Canada.He has lived in the ocean. But if you open his aquarium, he won't move. He'll continue to float slowly in his cell.Just a wall, between him and the freedom...A simple wall...But he'll never pass it...Maybe he's afraid. Maybe he's lazy. But it could be something different.Have you ever tried to remember when you was 2 or 3 ? I'm sure you did.Have you ever noticed that this old memory is like a dream you made a night ? All is vague, as it has never existed.I think freedom's the same thing for him; for Kandu, for Keiko, for all these captive creatures.For them, it's a beautiful memory...The wild wind who whistles in their ears, the rain who caressed their back when they went to breath the fresh, iodized air of the open ocean, the cold waters of the North, the taste of their mother's warm milk on their tongue, and maybe the taste of the fishes...The great time, when they sang to the moon, snuggled up between their mommy's fins, free, wild, in their family.But for them, now, it's just a dream.It's like all these wonderful things have never existed.A dream they'll never be able to concretize.An indescriptible dream, bathed in the light of the sun and the lapping of waves...

Yeah, there is a beam as soon as you get the labor harness, but you won't have to use it until Process That Never Ends.  Just quicky double-hit the sonar button, and your sonar should be splayed in front of you for a minute.  Use that to move and pick up crystals, both in Process That Never Ends and Sleeping Forces of Doom.Did that help?  D

As I remember, the most important is to hit 4 globes of the same color.I don't really know how to avoid the "laser" of the Asterite.If you want, you can use a cheat to have an infinity health.But if you want to do it without cheating, I dunno how to help you...Sorry...Just remember that you have to hit 4 globes of the same color.

More then I love your new style (and I do love it ^_-) I LOVE your coloring style! That is some major fine photoshoping my friend. How do you do it? I kind of looks like you select all the areas you want to color or something like that, or is there some other fancy secret to it? Either way...iIt looks excellent!

Wow, so much change, but then I have been gone for a long time I know, no not dead, but verry nearly so, let me explain?

Very Nice! It reminds me a lot of the girl from the Disney movie, Atlantis. Great colouring too, I might add.

Holy...I don't know what to say to that...That's just horrible, Trellius. Just be thankful you are both alive, I suppose. But man...What a thing to happen...I Hope that you heal, and that you are able to speak again (Obviously) Life can be cruel sometimes. You just have to stare it in the face, and keep on grinning, no matter what it throws at you. You are pretty noble for taking on such a good outlook on it, instead of falling into depression (as I probably would) It takes a lot of guts to simply think "At least I'm alive" and takes years for most people to say that when they have an accident as unfortunate as this. We are all pullin' for you here, and hope that everything works out. Keep that happy attitude, and don't let life get you down. It was also pretty brave doing what you did. You saved that kids life. You can label whoever you want a hero...Your favorite movie star, or astronaut, or whatever. But Trell has shown us all what it takes to really be a hero...Saving someone at your own sacrifice. Good luck with your recovery!

I cannot deny I was angry and outraged at first, beating my chest and cursing my evil fate, but It would do no good, and I know there is a greater purpous in this. I am glad for him, and hope he is doing well, or better at least. I doubt I will fully recover, heal yes, but speak, I honestly dont think so. I'm no hero Phosis, I just did my part, and perhaps a little carelessly. "More is less or go unread, a lesson learned, too bad I'm dead" ~ Luckely not thought. I am alive, glad to be, and respect and appreciate it more than ever before! Hehe, look out world! Here comes Spaztic-Bastard-Trellius! Mwaaahahahaah!   :P

Oh wow...Stenellya, that is absolutely sad!    When these animals are faced with freedom all they wanna do is stay...I have nothing to say to this, really, but WOW.  Y'know, I really should contact Kurisu and Sten, I think, they have pics of Orcas in their too-small tanks that would make any dolphin-lover just shudder.Nice description, too.

I'm not sure, but a good friend of mine sorta predicted right after the 9/11 incident that someone'd make a movie out of this.  My reaction is the same as you all's...absolutely sick.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, whatever you say, Trellius, that is quite noble.But at least we're glad you can get a nice attitude out of this.  Sometimes it's not easy to get a flash of light out of darkness.  People can be so dumb sometimes, I know, I've seen alot.  Anyways, we're pretty glad to have ya back.   :)

Well I'll be, I never knew that ether, thank you.

Many thanks OC, I am glad to be back, I've missed all of you!  Now I still need to figure out the new Arkonviox.com, and create a new danged face pic*groan* since this one is just temporary. :P

Yet another masterwork Cally! I remeber that movie, I loved it and have it in my collection somewhere. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I just watched the film "Instinct", starring the famous actor Anthony Hopkins. In this story, he's a scientist who studied the wild gorillas, and have killed someone. A psychologist wants to understand what brought him to kill. During the film, we understand that he killed hunters, who went in the montains to kill the gorillas, and take their furs. At a point, he goes to a zoo with the psychologist, and sees gorillas in a cage. He says that these gorillas are just shadows, and the only one who is different is a male, who has known the freedom. He opens the door, but the gorilla doesn't leave the cage. He explains that, for this creature, now, the freedom, the infinity of the forest, the rain on his fur, the sound of the wind in his ears are just far dreams. This part really touched me...Maybe, it's the truth, it's truly what the captive animals feel... I think about it, but about orcas and dolphins... Some tanks are near the ocean, so near that there is just a door between the cetacean and the wild sea. But if you open this door, the orca/dolphin will remain inside of his jail. Some persons say it's because the animal feels good in its tank, some others because it loves humans. Sad to say this is the case, if an animal knows nothing else than captivity, it will not understand the concept of freedom, or what it holds or means. :?

Trelluis im sorry that happened. It sounds like you havent let that take you down but im sorry it had to happen to you. Your family must be happy your okay and should be proud. i must say im proud. you put yourself first when you didnt have to, you could have just let all them people stay in danger but you went out of your way to make sure they were safe then you took it upon yourself to do soemthing about it. man your not only a hero your brave. im sorry that you were shot though, but im glad your okay. I wish there was something i could do for you. well if theres anything i can do for you let me know. I'm relly sorry that happened to you but no matter what don't let it hold you back.If theres a qoute that i think you should keep in your head heres a good one about a boy who wouldn't give up. he was up against all odds facing an evil tirant. his arm was broken when he tried to save his friend even though he couldn't fight he said one thing to himself..."I've only got one arm but thats all i need." in your case you cant talk very good now. but don't let that stand in your way, ha ha...who am i talking to....your a strong guy, i'll admit im proud you did soemthing so brave and sorry you had to pay the price.even though this isn't a good spot for subject change i'll update you on what you missed. my old server destroyed my website and screwed me over. were on a new server that hosts for free. my email address isnt working right now so if you need to get ahold of me email me at arkonviox2@prodigy.net. right now im working on a complete rebuild of the intire site. i hope to get alot of the old stuff back up as well as new stuff. other then that thats all you missed.well im glad your okay and welcome back man.

<div id='container'>
well im glad you and miana still survived all this time. i can picture the day my era ends. there will be people in another ecco community somewhere saying how they remember the arkon era. sad to say for most of you that era won't expire until i call it quits.

Oh, Trellius...Trell, I am so sorry. That is just terrible. But you're right - God was with you that day, my friend, He was indeed. Just like he was there for my dad during the entire month he was unconciouss. I thank God for your safety, Trellius, and I am so happy to hear that both you and your neighbor are okay; I was really starting to worry about you - I was afraid that you might not come back.Technology is a wonderful thing - even though you might not be able to physically speak again, you can always, always speak to us here on the forums, to tell us what's what. And don't even think for a minute that we won't listen, because we will. Welcome back, Trell. *hugs*

I agree to that, Kit. And here's another quote, that I use often (copyrighted  by me, though... I dunno if it has anything to do about art :/ )"Never say you suck.... If you do, you will/might convince yourself....."And I agree to that! You are absolutely right.

I own/read HBC and Visser but I still need to read The Ellimist Chronicles. My very fave book is The Andalite Chrons., though. &lt;3And I'm pretty sure I know what happens at the end of the series - Ax gets...well, won't give it away for others who haven't read the series! o.o

Oh, absolutely. It's pretty disgusting to say, but movie producers eat this kind of shit up. "Let's make a movie out of one of the most terrible things to befall our country to piss people off even more, thereby increasing hatred and animosity, when it should really be decreasing!!! OH BOY!! More money in mah pocket!!"Trust me - it's all about the money anymore. Nobody cares two ways about the other person as long as there's loads of cash involved.

Yep, you pretty much hit the same color of balls (4) to beat the level, of course the Asterite will try to zap you in the process. What I did was that I stuck to the upper right corner, struck a globe and then kept moving so the Asterite could not make a target of me and the I struck the other globes of the same color. Of course you are limited to your air. With pratice this should work!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Trellius..I do not know what to say, I am tears at this very moment. Hearing your story struck me deeply. I lost a good friend of mine in a simular manner and when I read this, I was very glad that you were safe, it was as if the past had came back to hunt me.Here we were wondering when you would come back, we all missed you here. We were wondering when the Vincent Valentine alter ego would return. I am very glad you did and that you are safe as well.Despite the fact that you may never speak again, it is the fact that you lived that mattered the most! What you did was very noble! Do not think otherwise for there are others that would not have done what you did.Anyways, I am just glad that you were able to come back, if you need someone to talk to. lemme know ok?*hugs Trellius*or judging by your current avatar... Emeralda? LOL.

Hehe, thanks for all the comments, and remember I used to STYLE from Atlantis ) For my style of cel-shading, I mentally pick out what parts will stay light and what parts I will shade. (I will make a tutorial of this one day..) I magic-wand select different areas, flood fill them with the base colour, and then I get the line tool and get the shading colour and draw in all my shading areas across the picture, then using solid brushes I fill the parts in.

Wow! I have been meaning to post up this pic for a long time now! I guess I forgot.

I want to make a board as spiffy as Arkonviox's. Something free, without ads, and eye candy graphics. I will learn whatever HTML required. Anyone wanna help me? After looking through several message boards I remembered that at one time how very much I wanted to make my own. I have so many ideas and I really want to follow through with them. As for a website, I don't have one, but after a few design works I should have one in a few months with hopefully a .com name too.Thanks for your time.PS: I know you all may not know me very well, my name was once spiderwing, and I've come back to the boards.

Ho my god...Trellius...*cries in emotion    *I admire you. It was a very noble and courageous act to save this guy.I'll never forget this story.I'm sorry about your vocal cords...I almost cried when I read about it...But maybe doctors will find something to "rebuild" it...Or give you new ones...I hope it for you...Anyway, I admire you, Trell.You have been heroic.I think Arkonviox.com counts a RL hero.

You guys.....thank you.

Err...yes Atolm, it was Emeralda...*sweats* I neded to reregister and just grabbed a random pic to serve as a temporary one. Heheh. Changed it now though, and since I had to cut my hair, this one suits me just fine. Again thank you all; OrcaCaller, Arkon, Kitnee, Atolm, Fargal, Ultima, Stenellya,.. and Miana-Chan.

Sort of...when you tap the sonar button twice quickly and hold it, your sonar stays in front of you and you can use it to move the crystals.  It sure makes it faster getting through the end of Process That Never Ends.  A little faster, but not much.For some, you have to practice it a bit.  The tractor beam doesn't stay, only for a short time.  But it should be easy.

Eh, She said she would learn whatever was required.

I just wanted to make this post for anyone who might care about my comic. Here's the skinny Part 1 up this weekend (crosses fingers).I figured I'd order up a sample, just so you guys can see what it's going to look like. Here's a part I hacked out of page 4//artdirect.dolphinparadise.net/preview.jpgThat's how it's gonna look... no color this round, just because the bitches are bigger and longer. But hey... no loss.Wish me luck!

People can be cruel.... I am glad to be here, I have made so many friends here!Arkon, Phosis, Noriko, Kitnee, Orcacaller, Stenellya, Talas, Trellius, Callyfin, Arsenal_Fierce, Tethys.. so many names to recall at such a late hour, I am sorry if I left  some names out, sleep  is overcoming me....Anyways, Happy Thanksgiving everyone.... *hugs all**goes off to sleep*

Also, sometimes captivity can be good, it would save the species if they were dying out in the wild. Or becuase they're sick.One reason I think they wouldn't leave is becuase they have been there for so long, they have no knowledge of surviving in the wild, no clue how to defend themselves or anything else. Or maybe they're confused by the ocean itself, and refuses to leave the tank, like a child who wouldn't leave its mother because it doesn't understand it's surroundings...Maybe I'm just rattling nonsense...

Also, sometimes captivity can be good, it would save the species if they were dying out in the wildNo, Miana.For some species, yes, it's right, the captivity can help to breed and put in the wild the animals born in the hands of the men.But for most of intelligent animals (felidea, bears, cetaceans, primates...), it's impossible.If they didn't grow up in their natural environment, they will never be able to live in the wild.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>

<div id='container'>
Agreed.Kit! We need a clue here!

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Don't get too fat on Turkey, we still have cristmas dinner next month!I read somewhere that Turkey has a sedating effect, you become sleepy, however slight, from eating it. Hmmmm.... :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*pops in with drumstick in mouth*really? I ate much Turkey today and I am very hyper.  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey! That is pretty good!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Really? I never knew that. I'm not much of a turkey eater, give me ham anyday. Smoked ham, turkey just seems too dry for me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey pretty good!Kingdom hearts is a fun game, so many memories with the old characters. Too bad no FF6 characters in there. Of course seeing Cloud and Sepriroth made me happy... Now if Vincent was in there somewhere.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Touching Sten.I need to go and see this movie.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Anyother hard levels out there?I remember Perils of the Coral Reef..Damn great white...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heh! Give me Biltong all the way!   
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ahhh I have heard of that book series. Never got around to reading it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well... although I don't celebrate the same Thanksgiven you do (nor know what it's about), I wish the best to everyone!!!You know... I don't even know what our Thanksgiving is about...  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's okay, I harly get to eat turkey anyway!But in my case...... Honey ham! =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yesssss! She be back at it! 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That is a pretty good avatar Trellius!Didja make it?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No, what I meant was for species that were endangered, or if a creature had gotten sick or injured than to take care of them. I wasn't saying that every single animal that isn't human should be in cages. Humans are not only war-like, they're also curious. They need to know how everything works, how it is able to survive in its enviroment and such. We're inquisitive we seek the knowledge to know everything. I'm not against captivity if the creature is treated with the care and respect it deserves. But I do agree they should be free if there is no reason to hold them captive, or they're treated badly. They don't deserve that, no one deserves that. It's the same with everything, with some good, there tends to be some bad to follow along with it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanx again one and all.   And Atolm, I did slap it together, yes.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow stenthat was really poetic especially for someone who has english as thier second language
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's okay, I harly get to eat turkey anyway!But in my case...... Honey ham! =DHmmmm sounds good.....*drool* :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I still say leave them as is, its a perfect game one should not edit. :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Whee! Happy Turkey Day! I, too, have many things to be thankful for - my friends, both online and not, my family, my talents...and of course my dad (and now Trellius as well) being alive and well. ^_^ *hugs everyone* Happy Thanksgiving!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
HA!! That's awesome, Doom!!!

<div id='container'>
Just two more pages to do for part one... I'm working on it!But I got a question for Arkon... could you tell me the name of that shoe store you used to work at? You'll get why when the comics comes out. ^_^ Thanks Ark.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heh, I'm a vego D *huggles Atolm and everybody tightly* Wish I could be up there with ya'll. Happy Thanksgivin'!

my sister(24) was pregnant 2 months....yesterday at 2:00 am she awoke with surprising bad pain.....she went to the hospital and learned.....*cries* she had a miscarraige......
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Happy Thanksgiving to everybody!  *gives everyone some cranberry sauce to go with their turkeys and veggie-stuff*I'm thankful for my friends, my family, these nice Ecco fan communities, my exceptional talent for writing (my english teacher says that), my pretty good talent for drawing, and my good luck, and the bad luck I learn from.And actually, some veggie stuff you guys might like is broccoli cheese casserole.  Anything tastes good when it has cheese on it   :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I saw that parade too...sort of an unofficial Thanksgiving tradition for me to watch the parade every year...lolThat comic looks pretty cool, and funnay!  Nice work on the art, too  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah!BLADES IN MOTION! :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Say, that's pretty neat!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wha!  Very neat pics, I likey!Kingdom Hearts seems like a really neat game, my bro wants to get it badly, and I would be happy enough just to watch him play it  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well what do you know! Heh, I must admit I never played DoTF though  :D
</div>
<br />

Humans dont know what the fuck they are doing. Thats why dolphins are smarter.

Godammit. Stupid news post. "Taught canadians how to hunt". Blasphemy. Canada is, and always will be, the coolest fucking country around. (except for brazil, china, japan, and africa)

<div id='container'>
My condloances Dread. I know nothing anyone says can undo what is done, but for what its worth, Im sorry for the loss....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*hugs Dread* I'm so sorry, I feel terrible for your sister. A mother losing her child is probably the most greatest pain a woman could ever face. I'm not speaking from personal experience as I'm still young, but the bond between a mother and child that is broken by death or some other tragedy can hurt very badly. I'm sorry for your sister, I hope that she'll get better.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes the symbol on my avatar means "faith" which has kept me going all this time, and is the foundation of my life. Ahh yes, it seems the winds ARE changing, let us hope they stay for a whle yet. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh this is even better! Honey smoked ham. *drools*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 Oh goddess no *hugs tightly* I'm sorry for your sisters loss.. thats horrible ;_;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
lol! That is so true Orca! :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ahhhhh! I cant take it anymore! *Starts eating his chair* &gt;munch&lt; Honey..... &gt;munch&lt; ..smoked... &gt;crunch&lt; ..ham....OUCH! Friggin screws! 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ooh, and don't forget the corn, mashed potatoes, rolls, green beans, pickles, applesauce... *dies* I just named my entire dinner...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Kingdom Hearts owns your ass! It's one of my favorite games ever. ^^ Thanks for your comments, I'll try to finish them as soon as possible. ^^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
My sis made this creamed corn souffle stuff that she makes every year....oohh, it's so good. &lt;3 Not much left of it, though. -.-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh...DL I am so sorry to hear that... *hugs*     I feel so terrible for your sister...the same thing happened to my cousin a few years back, too...it's a terrible thing to have happen. My thoughts are with you and your family.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Y'know something, Doom...you should really consider, like, making these things into published works; ya know how lots of online comics also sell books of their comics? You should do that, too, once you get some pages and stuff under yer belt. You'd make a lot.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OC's right!!! ^_^ Your turn!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Those are really cool, Miana!! :D I wanna play KH like life. ;_;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Bwee! Ultraspiffy, Cally! :D I really enjoy your work!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah, that's better!!! Awesome as usual, Cally!! :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ahhhhh! I cant take it anymore! *Starts eating his chair* &gt;munch&lt; Honey..... &gt;munch&lt; ..smoked... &gt;crunch&lt; ..ham....OUCH! Friggin screws! Well at least we know he is getting plently of fiber in his diet.. -_-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OK, I decided to repost my CGs. You can check them out here//sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/cg.htmlI've also done a new CG, which I haven't put up on the site yet, so I'll stick here for now//sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/Nichi.pngTis Nichi, my Phantasy Star Online character.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ahh  the sales.... you can get so many items for cheap! But then you meet the awful crowds who make huge lines at 4 in the morning just waiting for Best Buy to open up and then all the havoc begins....I came close to being in quite a few car crashes today as people were fighting for parking places, my heels became the victims of shopping carts ramming into them and going through the crowds of people who are ripping apart the cheap electronics section in hopes of finding that oh so cheap DVD player...But I came out alive and I finally got my desired item.... I finally got my damn scanner, last one in the section, and waited a long time in line to get it, despite the screaming kid that was behind me....oh you gotta love holiday shopping....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ouchies! X_x I stayed home for Black Friday.  :P But at least you got yer scanner! ^_^
</div>
<br />

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Lovely, lovely! Love the theme to it as well! 8)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yus, indeedy! ^_^ I actually just finished drawing a portrait of his older brother, Kinjita, who is a Purplenum RAmar. Now all I gotta do is scan and CG it. o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
My humar is from Oran...Your must be from there too right?*looks at character's emblem*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
w00! You finally have a scanner!!!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah... your link does not work for me... but Livejournal and your nickname... no brainer... i found the list anyways.awww.... too bad I am not on the list... -_- I would love to see a human form of my dolphin beast.Anyways cool picture(s) although I never bother to see the movie.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well Attie *snugs* You can be on the list if you want :) Its totally up to you, if you read carefully, it states that I am willing to add more.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thanks for the caring and kind words everyone...I too hope she gets better...she hasn't come out of her room since she got home yesterday...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ugh. As a fellow RPer, Miana, I am truly disgusted with that girl!  :x That is so terrible! I totally abhor people who have no disregard for other peoples' hard work. And not to be rude or anything, but this girl sounds like a total pill from the very start of it all. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's bad RPers. &gt;_&lt;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Whooooo!Akay...SUODSFATBUEMEthree words.Victo canya  with this one!  (I made up my own language that Orcas speak in my character's story.  This means 'good luck'.   
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Whee! That's fun - I'll see if I can find the list, too. n.n
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yep, Nichi's an Oran! ^^ I've also started this "gag" picture of Nichi in a Rag Rappy costume. XD He's just about as tall as one, maybe a tint bit taller.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm... TUBE OF MEDUSA, perhaps? But I'm not quite sure about that second "S"...  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes, this is damn near what my life is. This is why you treat me nicely ;)http://66.108.170.48/pics/albums/misc/adminspotting.png

As the topic says, I have a picture that I made for Sten quite some time ago. Now that I have a scanner I can show it to her finally!Here you go Sten//arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album02&amp;id=stenellya&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_photo.php

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ahh Cally, if you are willing to do such a thing for me that would be very kind. I hate to force things upon other people so I leave that choice up to you. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Curiously, I beated dotf without using that.  ._.;Me too, but I wanted to try it...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
To be honest, I've needed a soluce to complete Ecco DofT

They don't deserve that, no one deserves that. It's the same with everything, with some good, there tends to be some bad to follow along with it.First, I repeat it, the breeding in captivity CAN'T help to save an endangered species, if this species is intelligent and complex.Second, yes, you're right, it's good to cure the sick animals in a zoo; but we have to make them free again after their cure. Some zoos don't do it, and it's cruel.Third, it isn't useful at all to keep wild animals in a jail.When we don't know about a species, yes, it can help; but for most of the animals like dolphins, elephants, felidea, etc., we don't need to keep them in a cage any more, because now we can learn about them with K7, books, or trips in their environment.The comportment of a captive animal is totally different than the comportment of a wild individual.It's stupid to say that we can learn about an animal by keeping it in a cell.Zoos' directors say it can help to study them to defend their industry.

<div id='container'>
*hugs DreadLord tightly*   I'm really, really sorry for you and your sister, Dread...All my condolences for the little baby...I hope you, your sister and your family will be okay...

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't know where else to put this.I have many characters for many stories and online role plays. I work hard to make them all different. I'm very proud of them, they each have a little part of me within their souls. And I wouldn't have it any other way.But I never knew a friend would go so low. She copied three of my characters. Doesn't seem like much now does it? Well it does to me, when I've racked my brain out for each and every one of them. So of course I got mad, she starts whining that I'm making a huge fuss over nothing. Over nothing my ass!  She was hanging on a short thread of my patience. She's one of the most crappiest rpers I've ever read about to. Try to move the story along, she starts something that has nothing to do with it. *sigh* Another thing, she whines when her character doesn't have a guy... and she makes me or one of my closest friends to make up a character... Sorry for taking up your time. I just needed to get that out.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Aw dang, Moduvator got it right.And yes, it's Tube of Medusa, I just wasn't too sure whether it was Tubes or Tube.  Yer turn   :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Aw, dang, that's a real bummer.I've never had that happen to me before, but as a writer I can't still help but attach some sympathy.  Well, I wish you good luck for your situation!   
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
just do what i do. take one of her characters and make one of your characters kill them. that should make her feel a little agitated.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
heh dolphin i have always had respect for you. your the only one besides myself who says life can go piss on itself. but i truly wonder between the two of us who doesnt have a life and who does. seriously o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i could say i survived the after thanksgiving sale. for example i work at a bank and no one was there. i fucking love it!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
so far we have two skins.Illmatichttp//arkonviox.com/themes/PS2/layout.phpMy next plans are to get any other skins that were donated to me from people a while back but i might need assistence with those who made me skins to resent them to me at Arkonviox2@prodigy.netI got skins from callyfin and doomtrain and eao. and im gonna have to make requests out of them to add somethings so just let me know if you got the skins still or not.so email me...my next skin to work on is "The Undercaves" then im gonna put back up "A Time Forgotten" then "Enigma" which both are based on  my older site designs. Those will be easy to make the hardest will be the undercaves since it requires so much attention to detail. after im through with those im gonna work on building a content generator and get to work on reconstructing the sections and possibly assigning hit squads to help me get this done fast.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, wow, At!!! That is so awesome!!!  :D Very pretty.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks, Sten! ^_^  I'm pretty sure CG stands for Computer Graphic. Basically, it's what you do, too, with PSP. Touch up the picture and make it look neat. ^^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have all of the original Ecco Jap CD Skin I made. I can give it to you once I get a chance to upload it. You can tweak with it *intergrading it into your current site design*. I want to make more skins *just banners and side bits with a few new colours etc* with my new grunge and dirt brush collection, and have parts of the old design with Arkon, Crestoe and Atla *etc, etc* in parts. If thats cool with you :D

Ah, I too went out on Black Friday. Luckily I had training within the hallways of my school, so I wasn't too bad off. I remember going to Target, and finding the two games I wanted, Dance Dance Revolution and Devil May Cry. DMC was on sale and it was the last copy, so I'm hoping my mom got it. Oy, but it was fun fighting off the rabid soccar moms.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
How can I do a skin ?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Rappies! I wanna see them! They are so cute! especially the blues ones! XD
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have a scanner now! hooray! XDNow to do some things that folks wants me to do online for them, one being designing a logo for a Panzer Dragoon site.But for a while now I have been wanting to do something special for the forum members themselves. Perhaps a combination pic of all the characters? I think that would be cool and keep me busy for awhile too.some characters i already know what to do, Sten, Noriko, Kitnee, Arkonviox, I know what they look like and such of course there are members here who i dearly wonder if they have some form or more than one ocean form.I will be starting to draw the prototype picture as soon as i can, and if you want in on this just lemme know what kind of ocean critter you are and if have a pic of it it would help me out big time. =DI hope to make a wonderful picture of the forum members of this site.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
just make an html page that looks like my main page. and send it to me at arkonviox2@prodigy.net

I can relate to this, as someone who has had her drawings taken and altered and then claimed to be anothers... it is a very frustrating thig to do something like that.Another reason why I get afraid to do art for others.... i do not know if they  will like it or they do not appreciate the kind gesture.You should really bang some sense to this girl.... a person who copies works of another is someone that must be dwealt with.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'd like to be in it!   :D Although my character is a shapeshifter, her true form isn't hard to draw...just a regular-looking transient Orca, but with a spot of red on the tip of her dorsal fin and a black spot on both her white eye spots.    Good luck with the picture, it'll be great  8)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Honestly Cal... your cell shading is brilliant! You choose such nice, vibrant colors, and the way you ink really brings it all together very professionally. ^_^ I love it lots, keep it up!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You know Doom, there is a comic that is released in my college's newpaper that is simular to your style! i  think so anyways! Maybe I can send some to you!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's an excellent picture Atolm! Sten really does have a very beautiful character, and you depicted her quite nicely. ^_^ Good work!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Like I've said many times... I love your cell shading!!!! It looks amazing! And actually.... could I ask what you use to ink your works? I really like how you put the think outline around them. Hmmm... maybe I've asked you this before. Sorry if I keep wondering the same questions!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That looks great Kit!!! You're really doing a great job with this computer stuff! I love the way you and Cally cell shade so much... I can't do that kind of stuff myself. It looks wonderful!And on a side note... I've never played PSO, but Phantasy Star IV ROCKS!!!!!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heck yea! *Thinks about Wren.........*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That is wonderful idea!!! So many people have attempted it, but no one has really completed the job. It'd be a difficult task that's for sure! But I'm all for it Atolm, and backing you 100%!If it isn't too much trouble, I have an ocean character of myself. Back when I was called Doomtrain, I was an artificial, metallic dolphin. I'd love to give you a picture, but with Swift Currents gallery down, I can't seem to find it! If someone has the URL to Swifty's site, that would be wonderful! She's the one who drew my character for me. I'll keep looking for it, and let you know when I find it. It also has a whole pile of other people, so it should help you out a lot!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's finally here everyone!!! Part 1 of Chapter 1 is up and running, and the ball is on a roll! There is a bit of newness all over the site, alone with the new title. I really hope you all enjoy it a little. Production on Part 2 of Chapter 1 will be on a little hold, as I would like to do some sort of Christmas special. No promises there, but I will try!Check out the new beginning...http://artdirect.dolphinparadise.net/linkhpe_05.gifAnd I just want to thank everyone who didn't give up on me after I started over for the forth/fifth time. The support is greatly appreciated all! Thanks to everyone!
</div>

<div id='container'>
I'm terribly sorry to hear that Dread! I could never understand what your sister must be going through, but my love and prayers are with her. I wish the best for her and your family.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just a note... if you check out the Artwork forum, you'll find the Grand Opening topic on my comic... I'd love to discuss over there! ^_^And yes Atolm, I would love to see some of these comics! Feel free to send 'em over at: arsenalfierce@hotmail.com I'm always into checking out new comics.I also want to thank you Kitnee! I would love to get a comic published, but this is only my first ever, so I'm quite inexperienced in the field. It is my future dream though! I would love nothing more then to start doing works for Oni Press, but I still need lots more practice. I... suck at perspective. @_@ But I'm working on it! I hope that I can get this thing going really big... I only want it to get better and better.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ok I'll send it to! Lemme just find the papers now....Oh! A good way to start is by joining a journalism class since after all, there are comics in newspapers too!Are you in high school? College?College papers are always good for beginning comics! =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
indeed...*books a ticket*

*blink* *thud against head* *thud against head* Nope I still dont get it... :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Cool Idea. You have seen my avatar...Phosis is pretty much just an unhappy looking dolphin. And you know me from Darkseas, and how the fools treat poor Phosis, so you know what to do. Good luck with that!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just a thought Arkon, but don't you think you should work on the Content manager before those extra skins? I think it would be a good idea to start getting sections back up here. It has been quite awhile, and easter eggs should come after content.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Pretty good! I like your style. It is like...a Japanese/american animation Hybrid. Good stuff...keep it up this time!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
phosis i been working my butt for weeks to get the skin manager repaired. it will take a possible several other weeks to do a content manager since i got to program it from scratch and map it out.id rather have my easter eggs first then do the boring stuff =)besides i know you been waiting a while to help me out but its gonna take more then a content manager to show you what i need done. i got to map that out too and make assignments that follow my regulations.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Alright, coo'.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thats quite alright Krys :) I used a artline 0.3 for the basic outlines, I USED to use an Artline 0.6 for the thick outlines, but it died. So *get this o0* I use a faber castel black marker x.o;; if it works, and looks good, its good XFFFFFFFFFMm, I wanna get a set of Michron inking pens at the artstore, nrrggg, take me there mom! x.o; Heh.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
In my gallery, there is a pic of Doomtrain, and many of me :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
it re-enabled skins so people can choose between the two different ones we have.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks for the offer Cally, if I cannot find a pic of Doomtrain's robotic dolphin I will use it.Of course I can make a robotic dolphin as well. =D Just lemme know what you prefer Doomtrain!

</div>

<div id='container'>
If you want to play it, just get a DC. The are like 2 bucks now. Everybody I know sold there dreamcasts, and they are dumb fucks. I am keeping mine until I die, so when Im a crazy old man, i can be like "I was playin games while you were in diapahs, bitch." To all my kids. Shenmue is also an amazing experience. Or, if you dont want to buy a DC, or just cant find one, PSO is out for Gamecube now. I should start a dreamcast fan club. My friend has over 50 dreamcast games, and neither of us are getting rid of it. Sega rules!!
</div>

<div id='container'>
You cant trust me....Just look what I do to Silverfins Oekaki.NOW WHO'S THE DEAN, SILVER?ah, dont worry about it. I'll get mine in hell, I know. anyways, I cant wait to see it Atolm. Make sure you dont forget to put me in there. If I had drawing talent, you know I would do the same for you. (Remember my gift art?     )
</div>

<div id='container'>
Everyone... Thank you for your support, I really appreciate it!I have done prototypes for Kitnee and Phosis so far, progress is going well.More characters shall be made when time allows me to do so and as I look through the members, I get ideas on what I should do. Of course I do not know all characters forms, Miana, Trellius, do you two want in on this if so please give some sort of description.Vantid, do you want to be in it too?I ask this because I do not want to miss anyone, so please by all means, PM me or respond.Anyone else I miss?BTW Phosis, how could I forget that picture you drew for me? I still have it! lol
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>

Alright folks this is a topic that was once a tradition on this website. How it works is i begin the story then the next poster adds on to it. the story must be serious can have some humor but don't make it stupid i'm hoping this can become something that perhalps post in the fan ficts section. The story is sea related and will probably have ecco in it. o.oI want everyone to join....to make i worse i require people join in and contribute a good amount  :P So i'll begin this story...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My story begins in a ruined city of the continent atlantis, the city of tantalus.Deep withen the ruines lives a creature who lurks about like a cloaked beast who keeps any light away to protect the darkness that shrouds it. The creature is dolphin in origin but has evolved into something else probably because of how it keeps to the dark.The Dolphin creature has a tan brown skin with metal coming out of its fins. the tail is shrouded with feathers perhalps for flight. metal keeps open the gills on this dolphin creatures neck and a gold mask as if to hide deformality or the fact this creature is embarrised to be dolphin. Perhalps this creature was something else before? it would be hard to tell since this creature has observed death and life and death again. This creature has red eyes beneath a the gold mask which appears to be a land mammal type known as an atelope.The creature dwells the tomb like city which one was beatiful florishing with life....perhalps at one time one day this creature lived here to protect this sanctuary. Now that theres nothing to protect everything is better off dead. 14,000 years ago this city was above land and thousands of miles far off. Could this creature be that old? Th answer is yes.The creature was born of the old world race of dolphin who dwelled atlantis with humans. The dweller of these ruines was Arkonviox.Far off was another city belonging to Atlantis known as Thira. The Dolphins there were decendants of the old world atlanteans now apart of the new world and given a name...The Thirians. They worshipped a god who they belive will one day save the future from seven shadows who will rise from the unknown and bring forth the apacalypes. The seven shadows have already shown themselves...there has been a war with the thirians and these creatures who call themsleves the seven dark whales of apacalpyes. seven orcas who lost there white stripes to shroud themselves better. completly black....so whoever they hit wont see it coming.The leader of thira was king Trident, he knew how to handle these dark whales. A dolphin warrior known as crestoe who looked much like a thirian did. Thirians have long snake like bodies a long half oval fin that comes out of there back with small bones that hold it up. the fins have mutated into long fingers making what was suppose to be fins look like tree branches. dark rbown skin with tiger stripes sometimes. Crestoe was just like the rest of his thirian counter parts just as ugly but with eyes that show a type of remorse as if this creature isn't ment to harm it is ment for peace. he wore a helmet above his head which had long red spikes which covered his intire head and attached below the neck.The thirians worshipped Arkonviox...a dolphin with a mask...what they belived was tantlus was were his tomb lay dorment and no one should ever enter the holy city for they will never be seen again.Crestoe had happened to accidently stumble upon it during a battle and came face to face with "god". Crestoe didnt fear it cause he didn't belive in "god" the city layed out clues that Arkonviox was no ordinary dolphin. he was a weapon of mass destruction ment to protect atlantis. evidence indicated he wasn't prepared for the catastroph which hit and one day it would return...Arkonviox looked up and knew that time had returned. A red star grew bigger everyday but today it was no longer a star...it was a giant planet. every 500 years this planet appears out of nowhere. atlantis was a library of information with crystals called glyphs that recall this info. the red planet was vortex which resides in a neighboring star system called casandra. every 500 years our solar system collides with vortexe's orbit. Arkonviox looked up again....he seen vortex appear many times each time it appears it absorbs life from earth to keep its life alive.Except this time things were different...500 years ago a dolphin named ecco destroyed a creature which was the heart of vortex. this was a time to watch the sky to see if vortex had survived. Arkonviox knew it survived...the vortex queen was gone but the threat was still very real. The queen left behind a creature like herself but unable to reproduce....a creature who destroyed atlantis and could destroy earth. Arkonviox called this creature the vortex king...because even though the vortex were like bees with a hive and a queen in the human world the king is always the most powerful....the vortex king....Arkonviox looked at crestoe. Crestoe heard the stories of how arkonviox destroys anything which enters his ocean. this time things were different...if Arkonviox didnt act he wouldnt have a home...the dolphin with the mask told Crestoe to find the Dolphin who destroyed the queen...to find ecco and bring him back to the holy city to him. Arkonviox knew if he was to get his second chance at saving earth he would need to destroy ecco to prove he's the strongest.

A great and good thing you are doing Atolm! Nice one! My character? Well Trellius can be in water-based form (an ordinary hourglass dolphin, or land-based(Vincent from final Fantasy 7), choose whichever you wish depending on the scenario you plan to place us in.

Wow, an interactive story.  I'll go next, if I may     Ecco.  After his great plight with the Vortex, the young dolphin had grown since.  Once he wanted to stay with the pod he once longed to save, but he was was soon to act as if he'd grown more apart with his family.Day after day, he hunted with them, lived with them, talked with them.  But each night he'd stare at the constellation which his star markings copied.  He'd listen to the mournful songs of the great whales at sea, and wonder what it was like to actually live alone.Then came a greater tradgedy...after 500 years of life he'd seen each of his pod members live their lives and die.  He now doubted his immortality, for he'd outlived everyone he knew and loved.  All of his friends, gone from him.  And he, left alone with newer members of the pod, newer generations who stopped telling the story of the dolphin that saved the world.  These new members were strangers to him.Then one night he stole away under the cover of the moon to find the one being that could help ride himself of immortality forever, the very creature that bestowed the power upon himwink:

HhaaaaaaaaaHaaaaaaahhhaaaaaaaaHHaaaaaaaaaaaahhhaaaa!Hehehe, man, that's funny, reminds me of the Zelda manga I found and read.  Great job!*still snickers*

<br />
<div id='container'>
Ok, well I've never done this before, but I figured I should at least try it once so "I come baring a message from one older and wiser than I" Ecco lifts his muzzle almost excided. "The Asterite? Where is he?" Crestoe shakes his head slightly "No, he has never let me down, he will be back, I just need to wait a little...." "He is not coming back Ecco!" Crestoe breaks in." "He called you to him so long ago and has now abandoned you, stop looking for good sense here, settle for ANY! "What then?" Said Ecco, focussing on the strange messanger again. "Time is precious." Crestoe continues. "Let us not squander it here. Follow me, it is your only chance....and my last..."Well there's my two cents, hope it was at least mildly entertaining... 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What a freakin surprise, Phosis has a gallery. Well, Ive been screwing around with Photoshop lately, for school mostly, and figured I should get one up. I dont have any dolphin shit, YET. But I do have a CD cover I made done entirely in Photoshop, and you should tell me what you think. I am on page 2 of the gallery
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah, no wonder it reminded me of Disney art.  Even tho I never got a chance to see Atlantis (I wanted to but there was no one to go with).  Anyway, the picture looks really, really good.  And the shading is great.  I love the pose and everything, and the colors.I was wondering something.  You mentioned cell shading, and even though I can usually recognize it when I see it, I never really quite understood what makes it cell shading.  What is the difference between cell shading and anything else?  I never asked because I always felt stupid for not knowing that, but I might not ever figure it out if I don't ask.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That is awesome! I really wish I could do stuff like that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
My friends and I were huge Animorphs fans.  But neither of us read the entire series, altho oneof my friends picked up the last book (I'll have to borrow it from her sometime).  But, this isn't the place to be talking about it.  That's something for the OT forum.Oh, btw, I looked at the rest of the pictures.  Very good stuff.  You draw people very well.

For some reason Side 7 doesn't like to work for me half the time.  I'll have to try to look at them later.
</div>

I think I will stick with the hourglass dolphin Trellius unless you wanna see Vincent under water....... =D

Heh. I made the backgrounds first. Then I took some pictures from Hrgiger.com, and made them look almost completely different with my own touches. I made the text, and ran them through several filters, adding lighting. And, Voila! a front and back cover to hand in to my teacher, and get an outstanding mark. thanks atolm

But that is really cool....I think its Linus that is kat (dont remember names) That dorky kid with the piano is Jimmy (I think) Dawn is that bitch that always fucks around with charlie brown....Aw, I give up. I suck with the names, but trust me, I do know who fits who. great Job!

good work orcacaller good work trelluis.now for me to jump back in the pond.Crestoe felt he was doing soemthing wrong but if he didn't go through with this his kind would surley be vanquished by the seven dark orcas. Arkonviox was the savior and Crestoe had no right to question it, for atlanteans predicted long time ago a dolphin of old world would rise up from the ashes and save the future.Crestoe looke dat ecco as he lead him into the holy city tantulus were Arkon lay dorment. Ecco was not scared, he was courious and silient. A spark from his eyes made crestoe tremble a bit. Crestoe felt whatever was gonna happen it would be legendary. "Ecco, i brought you here because of fate. I have no chocie of what will happen next."Crestoe opened a door way and shoved ecco in. He closed the doors and took a deep breath...then crestoe followed inside.Arkonviox layed there quitly, his fins were folded and crossed and his head lie in between them. he was asleep but not for long because he woke up. The golden mask glimmered and past it you could see arkons dark red eyes stained with black. what was behind that mask? Ecco looked up at Arkon still not afraid. Then Arkon slightly moved his head up and charged into Ecco. Arkon opened his mouth hoping to get ecco's neck but ecco turned and swam trying to get out of arkons grasp. Ecco charged up his energy and let a sonar blast pierce Arkon breaking a wound in his side. The wound quickly healed then arkon grabed ecco with his mouth and sank his teeth in. Problem was Arkons teeth didnt pierce Ecco at all. It was like they didnt do any damage. Arkon backed up and looked at ecco then Ecco charged a statue in back of Arkon where an arm held a long blade causing the blade to fall forth and chop arkons head off.Crestoe "holy shit! this isnt suppose to happen. you killed the legendary Arkonviox."Ecco looked at crestoe in disgust. Arkonvioxs head slithered and jumped up rying to take a bite out of Ecco.Crestoe "you still havent won...dont you know a head severed can still bite!"Ecco charged up another beam destroying arkons head...but the peices reformed and gathered to the main body and arkon was restored.Arkon "what the fuck did you do to me? your the first to ever have done that. you proved yourself well. i summoned you here because a threat from the sky is coming back....although you defeated the vortex queen there is one more stronger and more powerful then she. i have come to call it the vortex king....the creature responcible for destroying atlantis. well the vortex queen is quite aware 500 years ago you defeated its queen and is comnig to take revenge on you. so in otherwords i need your help..."Arkon looked at disappointed he didnt win the battle. that was his second loss...his second humiliation..now he must live with it just like he lives withen the city he was ment to protect. Ecco as his chance and jelius that he was he felt he would later down the road betray ecco and defeat him.

Hey! Thanks for checking it out guys! And, well thanks for liking it! ^_^I did that whole working at Macys thing based on Arkon. And even though I think Macys is an all american store and they live in Canada, I just had to throw that in there. Kit, you think I should set up a Patpal thing? I was thinging about that a while ago, but I don't think for right now. Hardly anyone knows about it! Well, I would like to open the store again someday, but I'll wait for stuff like that till I at least get one chapter done.But thanks again everyone!!

Ah, I see! Well your right, they look good and they work fine, so nothing wrong with those! I have a few Microns myself. That's what I like to use. They have that nice semi-flexible tip thing.

Hmmm... It seems that Swifty has taken down the Arkonviox drawings. Well that's too bad! It was a perfect reference for lots of characters. But yes, Cally did draw my character too! I'll give you a little description... I'm just a regular shaped dolphin with metallic skin of course. The only thing is, I have a skull and cross bones on my forehead! I have a face pic that Kitnee made my of the picture by Swift current, and that'll give you the idea of it. I'll post that later when I upload it.

Well I have been alive for 17 years now, and it is a feeling of tiredness, hunger, and thirst. Mostly because I just woke up. Last year I turned 16, and got the ability to drive. This year, im 17 and gained the ability to....o_o;The point is, Im sure turning 18 will be fun. I will go out, get drunk, and get hit by a car. Hooray! The upside to today is that I get presents, food, and praise. And a ban or two from Yogoat, and a few insults from Dolphin. But that shit wont be happening. I am smart enough not to go to Darkseas tonight, and not to ruin a perfectly good evening with that shit. So for all you youngins who think that growing old is a cool thing to do, dont. Not until your 18 (or 21 in the US) Until your 18, you are weak, useless, and dont own a damn thing. And I dont mean possesions, I mean people. I am still the scapegoat in the chatroom, and the unwanted administrator at this site. But you know what?It feels damn good.-Phosis

Ecco scoffed and a small trail of bubbles is sent floating to the surface of the cave."Is that the best you can do? Hurl second-rate proclamations? I care not! I came here under the guise of a peaceful encounter and this is how you greet me? Are you addled in mind as well as body? Why, now, should I believe anything you say or do? What little trust I had is wearing thin and will take allot of tending to be mended! For all I know you could be in league with them!" Ecco began to float upward and back slowly. "Give me a reason...a GOOD one..."

Meanwhile, in a distant part of the universe, two creatures pondered the events on Earth. There were thoughts stirring. Though they were not all very intelligent, they were still thoughts. Sete and Sosaris swam about in the night, in the empty void of nothing that they inhabited. "I don't like this." Sete began. Sosaris replied, "No one does. Nothing good can come of it. But what are we going to do?" Sete sang loudly, "Well we could go down there, if thats what your meaning. Its not like we have anything better to do." Sosaris never agreed with Sete. "Take the form of a mortal again? Id rather blink out of existence then have to do that again." They were not particularily bright, the brothers. They had a few ideas, and a few revelations, but nothing spectacular. They had watched over the years, as the events on Earth had unfolded. The unfortunate events with Vortex, and Ecco. The miserable quests of other singers (Which were fairly unpopular compared to the saving of the world) And other things like that. They werent Gods. Gods were powerful. They were just spirits that loitered around, pretending to be higher powers."I want to try the fish on Earth again." Sete said. "All you think about. Fish. We are talking about the possible destruction of...er...something. You know. Whats it called." Sete insisted "The world?" Sosaris was gleeful. "Yeah. Thats it."They couldnt do much. Perhaps just watch the events and make stupid comments like "Wow, that was a big explosion." Or "Jeez, I'll bet that would hurt." But they decided to go anyways. "We will stay out of the way, is all." Sete suggested. The two Star singers swam through the endless voids of space, down to Earth, to watch from afar...and eat some much wanted fish.

Happy birthday Phosis! I hope your day comes out well.

I had to size it up a bit actually, forgot to mention. It just needs to be a few pixels wider on width and hieght. Dont remember exactly how many, but it wasnt that big of a problem.

Ok so I have been cookin' up some stuff on Photoshop and this is my best sig I've made...http://home.attbi.com/~williamdewolf/wsb/media/133440/site1.jpgany good? I made it for a friend. So Miana_Blade, you want me to make ya one? Just send me a pic(s) and I'll make you one.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Happy Birthday Phosis! ^^Don't be so glum, I'm 17 as well, so you're not alone.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah I'm bored. -_-* So I'll do a custom background for anyone who wants one. Just choose three main colors that you want, and mesa will create you one. ^^Examples//www.deviantart.com/deviation/830406http//www.deviantart.com/deviation/830441http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/834530
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Whee! Can you do one for me, Mia? ^^ I need something wintry for my site's main page, so the colors should be a few shades of blue and white that kinda resembles snow? Is that helpful enough?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ooohhh, can I have one made? Of white, purple, and aqua? :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
BWEEE! Awww, how kawaii, Doomy!!!!! ^.^ Great job!

<div id='container'>
I opened Arkonviox.com and my eyes just about popped outta my head! I wanted to say that it looks REALLY cool! I love the dolphin button on the side, and I like the ARKONVIOX.COM at the top, how it looks just like the text in the game and is even all wavy and stuff. And then there's the bg, also just like in the game. I have no idea how you did this, Arkon, but I have to say that I am really lovng this new skin. And I like how the forum looks, too, without the boxes. Gives kind of the appearance of floating. You know something's good if it passes my eye without a single complaint.  Wait a second...is this based off of some old site?  *shrug* Well, if it is, I never saw it before so as far as I'm concerned this look is brand new.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
HAHAAHAA
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well I finally got to look at them.  They're really good.  What did you use for the first three?  What kind of paper is that?  Or is it some sort of photoshop effect?  Well, they're drawn really nicely.  Altho the last one looks a bit blurry, but it's still pretty good.Unfortunately, I dont have a PS2, and I probably will never be able to get one.  I really wish I could play Kingdom Hearts, it looks lke a great game. Even tho I never played an FF games.  I didn't realize those were all FF characters.  Actually I thought there was only two characters--I think they only showed two in the commercial.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Those are really pretty, Miana.Currently, the bg's that I have for both of my sites were actually taken from other places...So, it would be very nice if you could make a couple for me.  If you don't mind.  I would like one in pastel shades of purple and blue.  And the other in green, blue, and like a spring green.  If you'd be so kind, please.  Thank you.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's very pretty.  I love that dress.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Holy crap, she's right. O_OIf Tethy's likes it, we must be doing something right.  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Very pretty.Hm...I think I must have seen that already...it looks very familiar.  Something about the position...Well, it's lovely.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow thanks tethys.   This has to be the complex skin yet. the next one im gonna do will be just as complex but i got to make some finishing touches first on this skin.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
happy birthday to the guy who i dub...."my favorite canadian" o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's really cool.I feel kind of ashamed I haven't even looked at that comic of yours in ages. I should do that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow o.o I have a little bit of trouble with the Undercaves sidebar with the dolphin button here on Mac IE. but its all cool D. I'm making up a new skin to make up for how much I hate the other one I made for you before ^_^ Its going to be one using the same number of graphics as Illmatic //callyfin.dolphinparadise.net/logo.jpg http//callyfin.dolphinparadise.net/sidebar.jpg
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's beautiful, just like the others.  You're really good at that shading stuff.  And you do really well with that style.Oh, that link doesn't work for me.  It says "no such entry".
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
&gt;^^&lt; Thanks, Teth! Yeah the PSO pic is probably the most complex CG I've ever done, only because I had tons of layers for the different parts of the shading. I had a layer for the light shades, and one for the dark shades, and I had one that showed me the color combos and where they went and stuff. @_@ I'm currently doing a smaller figure of Nichi and when I'm done, I'm going to combine the two pics and make a "profile picture" for him. ^^
</div>

aaahahah! thats so awsome! half past empty is so great.and the best part is...thats what my christmas trees look like XD~~

Well...I figured that since I don't toss out sea-related pics very often, I may as well show you all what I normally do.  Which happens to be mostly furry art.  And some anime.Here is my Side 7 archive//www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpBB2&amp;file=posting&amp;mode=newtopic&amp;f=5and my TeamArtail archive//art.teamartail.com/cgi-bin/imageFolio.cgi?direct=Cynthia_Beehrit's basically the same stuff, but I don't put anything non-furry there, since it's meant mostly for furry art.I also have a couple pages on the old gallery//www.teamartail.com/fanart/beehcynt/   (don't try to go to the website link there, it doesn't exist anymore).And, finally, my website//members.tripod.com/tiarra2/There's a few pieces of art there that isn't anywhere else, and along with that there's also some things that I wrote.Tiarra is one of my online aliases, in case you are wondering.It will take you a while to get through everything.  So, enjoy!

"Well, Arkonviox?  What have you to say?" Ecco continued with him.Arkon's reply was a faint growl of frustration.  "I thought you were Ecco.""I AM ECCO!" the dolphin harshly replied, "Why do you say such things?"Arkonviox just put a smirk on his face.  "I can read your heart...and it has been hardened over 500 years with loss, and pain.  In just 500 more years, I predict, you will have lost that heart altogether.  Providing, that is, we live that long."  And he showed Ecco the sky, the red Vortex planet coming ever nearer to them.Ecco cast his look downward, away from the face behind the golden mask in front of him.  "I cannot deny that.  But even so, I would never have attacked you purposefully like you have done me.  Tell me a good reason that I shouldn't leave and just let the Vortex king destroy you, or I swear, I will leave your malformed body to the sharks."Arkonviox's eyes widened.  Ecco was never like this before he'd gotten his powers.  As he was staring at the hardened dolphin in front of him, he suddenly had a sinister idea.  "Ecco, I have a proposition for you.  If you fight this evil, I will loan you my mask and armor."Crestoe gasped.  "You cannot do that!  You will..."  but he was cut short by a dangerous glare from Arkonviox.  He remained silent, and just supposed he knew what his master was doing.Ecco glanced back.  "I cannot take your armor.  I already have powers stronger than any other in the sea.  If I wanted to fight this entity, I could do it with my eyes closed.""But you don't understand, Ecco," Arkonviox relayed calmly, and dangerously quiet, "I too am immortal, to the point which you have just seen.  My armor has greater powers of sonar, of charge, and even speed.  Hidden blades will slash through your enemy before he even knows he's dead.  And this entity I predict is stronger than five Vortex queens combined.  With my help, you can and will defeat him."Ecco looked over Arkonviox with curiosity and suspicion.  Hmm, it does look like it could be useful... he thought to himself.  "I think I shall swim here for a bit longer.  I am interested, but you will have to wait the next day for my descision.""Take all the time you need.  I'll be waiting."  With that, Ecco left.  Crestoe confronted Arkonviox.  "Have you gone crazy?  You haven't lived without that armor for years!"Arkonviox just smiled.  "I know the risks.  See, I intimately know my powers well.  This mask and armor does indeed bestow power upon its wearer, but there is one complication.  It also replaces their spirit with one of it's last wearer.  My body may disentigrate, but I will inherit the body of Ecco.  Then, even though it seems Ecco's the one saving the world again, it will instead be me!  And I shall regain my former glory!"Crestoe was quite confused, but decided to go along in spite of his own safety.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah...the few times that I've actually been in #DS there's nobody there. o_O

Ecco swam in silence now, his heart heavy, his thoughts clouded and full of questions."Could he be right? Have I changed so much?" He stopped swimming and bobbed in thought. "...if it were true...who could blame me I suppose... I had lost everything, everyONE I ever cared for. I am no longer OF this world and cannot fit in anywhere.... and for what?" He closed his eyes as a cold realization set in. "I do not know......nor do I care...." He opened his eyes once more and with a powerfull kick swam to the surface breaking the water surface into a cool night sky. He looked around and up. No visible landmarks could be seen. The moon, full, large and blue, hung shining in the sky, offering Ecco the comfort of an old familiar face."Lunar bay?"  "I.." He began. "I wish none of this ever happened. I wish I was still back with my pod, with my family and that the Vortex never......" Ecco's breath cought in his throught. "That's it! The Vortex! If the Vortex never came.....never existed....it would never have happened!" A wave of excitement washed over him. "Within the Asterite's cave there is a glyph with no song inside it, an empty shell that was never used. I shall use the song of recreation given by the Asterite to copy myself, my essince into that glyph. No one knows of it's existence other than me and the Asterite, should something go wrong, at least I will survive within the glyph!" Ecco chattered with exticy. "I can....no....I will do it!" If I swim all night I should be back before sunrise tomorrow! Then I shall take up the offer given me by Arkonviox, use his armor and the Atlantian time machine to go back to the time before the Vortex came and destroy them on their own grounds!" And with hardly a second thought Ecco sped off into the dark waters below......

<br />
<div id='container'>
LOL! I have to explain my siggy to you again, Trel! There's a funny as hell site called asksnoop.com. You type in a URL, and it "Snoopifies" that site. That's a snippet from a DeadJourmal entry of mine.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Lemme try this, hope you dont mind my Character Arkon. ^_^****************The dark waters is a place that few go, for in the dark many evil things linger, there you will find a fish who will swallow others many times its size, there, you will find the giant squid with its terrifying giant beak....Not that it necesarilly make the dark waters a very evil place, little life lives here and you will only run into the giant beasts now and then, an occasional shark will pass through here only in hopes of finding any large animals that had died and sunk to the bottom.Which made Atolm wonder why there were so many sharks in a particular area.There they were, darting here and there, trying to go to a particualr area but quickly darting out, as if something was down there. Ah yes, the stench of blood was in the water, it was a strong intoxicating scent indeed, so much that even she was attracted to it.A six gilled shark passed her, barely missing her protruding spikes and she watched him rush into the fray.She swam closer, sonaring on what it could be.Sound told her it was two massive shapes, one was obviously a sperm whale and they were a common site here, they spent their time hunting down the giant squid and that was okay to Atolm, Squid was not a favorite in her diet and so she did not fear any competition from them.The other shape was alien to her yet almost too familer, it struck an old hatred within her, yes, what ever this creature was, it brought back bitter memories.Her yellow eyes focused beyond the fray of sharks and it was then did she see the mamgled body of the sperm whale.what was left of the body anyways..... the lower jaw was missing, only a few threads of muscles was left hanging and these were gladly being picked off by the sharks and the scanvenger fish. The stomach area was split wide open, entrails hung out leaking out their bodiliy like fluids and the tail of the animal was missing, only bits of muscle remained.but it was the sound of flesh being ripped apart that made her look upward from the sperm whale...The creature happily crunched on the dorsal side of the whale, his mandibles clucthing hard on the body, his teeth diggin into the tender flesh.Atolm knew the creature instantly, the infamous Vortex race!Legends of the Vortex was known throughout the seas, they would feed upon the plaet every 500 years, their quantities of food increasing every time.... this was no ordinary legend to tell among the normal creatures!but the legends also speak of the dolphin known as Ecco who saved the earth one time from this fearsome race, the dolphin boldly confronted the queen and defeated her...But there was alos the legend of Arkonviox, a masked dolphin who would defeat the Vortex as well.which would be true, both Arkonviox and Ecco were worshipped in all the seas, but then both are also known as evil beings depending on which pod you would happen to run into.Ecco, to some pods was the destroyer of certain futures, only his future, with the flying dolphins was made possible trough his actions.Arkonviox was a creature of destruction, only existing on this world so that it may suit his needs.Atolm swam away from the carnage, the Vortex was very much into his prey to notice her. The Vortex had made their apperance after so long! Yet Atolm knew that she did not have the power or strength to fight this beast, her last battle with the Sichem creature nearly done her in...... not that she could get killed anyways.... but it was the fact that she suffers from wounds like any other creature...So starts her journey to Atlantis, the only place where she heard of the ancient legends and in hopes of finding the dolphin heroes there...

Very nice indeed! I do love your fury pictures (especially the one's looking like Sonic), although for the fact that I'm not a big fury fan in general I really love your few humanoid pictures! I think that "Jarys Oliphion" was pretty cute. ^_- And I also liked "Rayna Henstin of the Guardian Force"!My favorite fury you did would have to have been "Chester Prower" Super cute, super cool, as is anything resembling Tails. ^_^Keep up the great work on all of your stuff!

He was drawing nearer to his destination, but it had seemed too easy... way too easy. Something isn't right... he charged his sonar and sent it rippling through the waters ahead of him. Nothing... its like when the Asterite died, all life around him went with it.... Ecco shuddered, and continued fowards, reaching the entrance to the Asterite Tunnels. The waters had grown so dark that he had to rely on his sonar vision only. He swam on and on, no traces of life drawing near, but the caverns grew lighter as he neared the chamber the Asterite formerly occupied. The light of the sole glyph in there growing brighter with every thrust of his tail flukes. Almost there... Ecco praised himself mentally. It was almost over, he would copy himself and stop the threat of the vortex, and nothing would stop him from achieving this. "Halt!" a deep feminine voice rang out through the caverns, just as Ecco was about to enter the grand chamber. What the? Ecco froze, looking for the source of the voice. "These caverns are forbidden, how dare you intrude..." a long, bulky dolphin rose up from behind the solitry glyph. Her black fur tainted with blue light was long and sleek, her eyes where cold. "What? Who are you!" Ecco demanded harshly. "I am but a loner, an Atlantean, who are you?" she replied darkly.

<div id='container'>
cool cool. Imagine...the few ecco fans from calgary gathered around, sharing war stories in some god forsaken bar, shooting back whatever liquids they see. Ah yes. It will be most exquisite, until the next day, when I wake up slumped underneath a seat on the C-train, with some paranoid bum checking me to see if Im bugged with some microscopic radio equipment.So, Yeah! Ill come drinking with ya. It will be fun (Except for the whole bum thing. But you get that a lot in canada, as anybody from there will tell you.)

Hey guys! Long time no see! Let it not be said that I'd leave the Ecco community forEVER. Maybe a while, but not forever. I just sorta... wanted to make sure the whole site crashing thing had blown over before signing up again. Now that it IS, I guess all I really have to say is I'm back! And... that's it. So... hi! :3

Loo loo loo loo-loo loo looooooo..."You didn't answer me right away! You had to think about it! I KNOW WHEN I'VE BEEN INSULTED! I KNOW WHEN I'VE BEEN INSULTED!!!"I always liked Marcy. Even though Peppermint Patty basically owned her. Damn Peppermint Patty. Ah well, her initials are PP anyway.

I was looking into the Glyphs for my Maybe One Day Will Be Written Atlantis Story, and dictionary.com says that 'glyph' is 1) a universally recognizable symbol (such as the Recycling Arrows, or a Stop Sign or something) or 2) a key of some kindMakes sense.

Holy crap-oly! To be totally honest, it's fokin awesome! The face is perfect, and everything else about it looks equally as nice. The detail is great, and the position works very well!

((Hope he doesn't mind Miana joining, she's basically a human now, but she can change into her 'phantom' dolphin))*~*~*Sunlight filted through the waves above, glinting off the scales of small fish swimming through the reefs. Bright pinks, reds and yellows of the plants were vivid, and the assortment of creatures matched that very color scheme.Against the outcrop of a cliff, man-made stone. Intricate designs were skillfully carved into the white marble. A square opening into pure darkness. But that wasn't what caught your interest. A young woman sat on the stones, her legs hanging over the edge, swinging softly. Pale white skin gave a golden glow if the light could hit her. She wore blue robes, with silver trim. A velvet black choker with a silver circle adorned her neck. Her lips were a soft velvety pink, and her eyes wide. The top was black and faded to baby blue framed by long black lashes. Floating around her frame, was her hair, a strong blue tint contrasting a pure silver. Miana watched the fishes swim about in their erratic manner, her thoughts lost to concentration. /Something's disturbing she thought, she spun for a moment, looking behind her and deep into the darkness. /I better go see Whitefin, if I know her, she's probably has sensed this as wellWith a blinding flash of light, and scaring the bejeezes out of the fish as well, the young New World Atlantean changed into her white dolphin form. She blinked, her eyes adjusting before swimming off into the ocean.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Man, I always seem to fail at catching you guys off guard with levels from the older games...oh, whatever.  Yer right!   Your turn, Stenellya!   :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Miana followed her gut instincts. Ever since she was driven out of Atlantis, she lurked around the Asterite's caves... she swam deeper, and deeper, reaching the entrance to the caverns. The stars atop her head providing light for her. "Whitefin?" Miana swam in deeper, hearing voices echoing, no - bickering. "I am Whitefin, a prehistoric atlantean" she shifted her crest, looking at Ecco with glazed eyes. "I need to use the glyph" Ecco began to swim by her, but was stopped by one of her long fins. "Ah, no" Whitefin smirked. "Whitefin?" a soft voice echoed through the waters.

Two silvery dolphins swam through the sea. It was not a majestic, or beautiful sight. They were lost. "You don't even know where we are?" Sete asked, annoyed. "well what does it look like? Do I have a map, you idiot?" Sosaris replied. They swam for awhile longer, the sea large and unfamiliar. They had not thought things through before hand, and now they were paying for it. As far as Sete knew, Atlantis was on the other side of the planet. "I never liked Earth that much anyways..." Sosaris began, in an attempt to redeem himself. "Oh, Shutup."They did not retain there powers here. Those would be gained gradually, over time. Sete hoped they wouldnt be here that long in any case. They had watched Arkonviox from the skies since time of memory. He was always their favorite creature. What he was, they weren't sure. They were Gods of a sort. They were not planet ruling God's, nor did they have power to back that up. They were called watchers...made to observe the world of the living, for easy reference. The Gods would call on them when information was needed. Since that hadn't happened in over 11,000 years, they figured it would be okay to take a vacation.The sea was cold, the sky was red, and the watchers were getting tired. "Let's just get to Atlantis." Sete said. Sosaris disagreed. "We can't make it. It will take weeks." Sete insisted "What about the wind tunnel?" Sosaris groaned.The Earth was riddled with little secrets, unseen by eyes of mortal beings. They were little devices and tricks, planted by Watchers and God's to make travel easier. Wind tunnels were patched, all across the sea. They came up in the form of cold spots, or warm spots in the water, to the living. To the God's, they were a complicated mixture of apparatus, used to make a quick hole in hyperspace. The Tunnels could hook up to almost anywhere on Earth, and with the blink of an eye, and a very painful ride, travel could be made within seconds; only for higher powers, of course. Creatures like Crestoe, Ecco, and other divine creatures knew little of these. Arkonviox was the only being to have a real knowledge of them, but he did not use them often; it was a most uncomfortable trip."Oh, that is cold." Sete said, stopping in the patch of ocean water. "do we have to do this?" Sosaris asked. "As you said, it will take weeks if we dont. Activate it! This water is most chilly." Sosaris sang, his deep rythym of voice bouncing through the sea. The colder water tinted purple, giving a very visible glow to differentiate itself from the rest of the water. Suddenly, Sete felt his body, twisting and pulling. He was slowly slurped up into the purple void, Sosaris falling behind. It closed behind them, as if it was never there. Travelling through the Wind Tunnel was like riding a vicious roller coaster; If you multiplied the speed by 100, and took away all sound, sight and smell. It was a horrible feeling, as if your soul had left your body, floated up into space, and then was shot out of a gun, down into your body again. In a word, it was Nauseating.But then, it was over, as quickly as it had come. And they were no longer in the middle of the dead ocean, but now facing the massive expanse that was Atlantis, in all of it's glory. "Well. That was most fun. Now let's rest...My head is dizzy." Sete said, as he slowly sunk to the bottom, trying to get over the feeling of travel.

Atolm's black flukes puped through the water, not a moment's rest for her! Atlantis was not too far off anyways.However it has been many years since she last passed through the ruins, many years indeed and she recalled the legends Sichem had once told her."Atlantis was a wondeful place indeed, human and dolphin lived together in harmony, they understood each others words, together they leanred how to change their forms and together they learned how to travel through time.A series of time machines were created by the Atlatians, each one placed in a vital city, for use only when should the danger arise, if such a danger would reveal itself. Foolish Atlantians, they knew no concept of Vortex, they never expected something from the skies that would betray them and that flaw of theirs left their empire in dismal ruins. They may have escaped into the past but they did nothing to stop the Vortex foe. The Vortex continued their consuming of the Earth it was only then that Ecco defeated them.""The Atlantians are lost in time now, scattered, only a few pockets of them remain in this present era... their only thoughts are the Nostalgic days of what has been."A deep growl from Atolm's throat as she recalled Sichem's gender-less voice, she had learned long ago to not listen to that beast nor the rantings of any other creature.Or course dolphins always had their strange songs, the high pitch squeals, the happy clicks, the piercing whistles......and then their songs of happiness! Songs of delcious fish, songs about how good it was to be alive and then the songs of legend like those of Ecco and Arkonviox......Atolm took a sharp turn in disgust, "What kind of shit is that? singing songs? As if they are singing to Gods or idols or a presence that cannot be seen..... They live only to be eaten and to decay on the ocean floor..." She recalled the taste of Dolphin flesh, it was something that she had stopped consuming many years ago, but the sweet taste of it was fresh in her memory....As she pondered this two faint images of dolphins came into view, silver in color they were but overall very plain as if done on purpose. One of the dolphins started to sink toward the bottom, obviously very tired from what it seems to be a very long trip. An exhausted dolphin does not tend to last that long and would be a welcome sight to any scavengers out there.This oddity attracted Atolm and with a strong flick of her serpent tail flukes, she rushed toward the two dolphins, wondering what was amiss...

umm i don't want to come across cynical and horrible etc, but its just a movie! its a movie with crappy acting and a big fat dude that terrorises the other inmates (yes i have seen it).it suprises me that its been out for AGES since before i was in 5th grade (im note entirely sure, but its been out for years)  and only now you watch it??? come on!maybe the animals realise that when the door are opened they want to stay inside. they realise that they're getting food for free, a nice clean tank and just about nothing to worry about.this brings me to another point im going to make. how can we be sure that the urge for freedom is universal and is shared by all living things? the reason why an animal may run away when you try to close in on it is fear of you and what you may do to it once youv'e caught it. this orca you talked about has been in captivity for a long time, it realises that humans aren't gonna hurt it. it lives a life of luxury and plenty. it isn't like these animals are chained to a wall and beaten contiunously (at least im pretty sure they aren't). an orca isn't a little child, it can think rather well. it is content. isn't that what we all want? to be content? if i gave you all the freedom you could imagine, you wouldn't use half of it coz either you were afraid, coz you didn't understand, or coz you couldn't give less of a damn. even now you are free to do a whole lot of stuff, stuff that you haven't done in a while, be it ask out that girl you've had a crush on since the 2nd grade, or paint a masterpiece, or even watch a sunrise in the morning. everbody seems to believe that there is more to life than they will ever know - why can't they ever be content??

Yes, it was. The ones in ToT are just meant as an annoyance, not as a real threat like the original... The drones (the grabby ones) are meant as the real threat...

Why do people always ask about groups or bands?  What about solo artists?  There's a lot more solo artists that I like than bands.Hrm...my favorite singer is Mariah Carey.  I don't care what anyone else thinks of her.  As for genre, well I like mostly pop.  I prefer soft rock to anything else.  But I do like some less soft stuff.  I like classical, too, even tho I don't listen to it much.  Oh, and I like Latin Pop.Yeah.  That's it I guess.  I could list all of the artists and groups that I like.  But I won't.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Haha, hey (wo)men, I didnt know any of you actually liked me.Yeah, Arkon, I left because there were a lot of things i had to do, not entirely because the board sucked.  I'm just glad to see that this place is still around and theres not too many clueless newbies.

I dont like J-pop...But I do like J-rock (Yes you cynical people...There IS a difference. its the same difference that exists between micheal Jackson and Pantera.) X, Dir en grey. Both good bands. I just like them cause they are heavy. I like metal, but none of this new crap. Slipknot or whatever. I like the older stuff. Classic rock as well. Queen, Judas...Yeah just about all rock and roll. (The fact that the singers of Queen and Judas priest were both gay is NOT a hint at my sexuality. Im as straight as a godamn rod.) I cant really hack pop. Or R&amp;B, or even most rap. When i say most, I mean most. Not all, just a lot of it. If I listen to any rap, it is oldschool. Instrumental music does it for me. Classical shit like Bheetoven. But mostly Classical chinese. The instruments they use are fucking amazing.The sphere owns my mind when im in Darkseas. So whatever the fuck kind of shit that is, it is good as well. Consequently, Im listening to X right now, so you can kind of tell what my latest thing is.

(why don't we stop trying to bring in our own characters and stay with what we've got? i think this quest of ecco's is getting a bit too crouded! - atolm i hope you don't mind me taking control of your character)The two dolphins shuddered and cringed at an unseen pain that coursed through their bodies. Atolm peered at the odd pair and tried to figure out what was up with them. Although they looked like dolphins, their entire demener was completely wrong. Usually dolphins would never approach these depths unless very foolhardy, or trying to display some foolish sense of bravado. Atolm approached the two singers feeling secure that they would not be able to harm her, after all they were only a pair of very stupid dolphins weren't they?Atolm greeted the two curiously but suspiciously. 'Greetings young ones. what brings you to these depths of waters?'one of the two clicked in ammusment. 'Young ones, she calls us - young!' The other gave the first a sharp prod with his beak. 'I apologise for my brother's stupidity - he has a brain the size of a peanut, you see' Atolm didn't follow, what is a peanut? in any case, she assumed it to be small. 'My name is Sosaris, this is my brother, but you have no need to know anything about him. We are on our way to an area known as Atlantis, perchance you have heard of it?'Atlom gazed at the two in bewilderment. She had expected the two to be slightly 'off' but they were simply out of it - and yet they too were on their way to Atlantis. 'Let me introduce myself. I am Atolm - ' at this the other dolphin broke in'Your name is Atolm? What a coincedence! my name is Sete.' The two dolphins howled with laughter. Atolm was left puzzled, where was the coincedence? she decided that this must what the dolphins found so ammusing, but the truth was that the amusing thing was the look of confusion on the visage of such a fearsome creature.She continued 'As i was saying, i too am on my way to Atlantis and you two are welcome to join me' he said, flashing her sharp teeth in a most fearsome smile.The two dolphins stimply looked at each other and said 'okay' in unision and stared to swim slowly but steadily in the direction that Atlom was heading when they met, leaving Atolm confused and now slightly with the two dolphins - maybe she would revive his long relinquished taste for dolphin.wow that was pretty good!

I'm not very good at that game... I just mash poor Ecco Into walls and shark jaws :(
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hrm...i've run into a problem with one of them.  The purple one is fine, it looks good.  But with the green one, half of the text doesn't show up very well, no matter what color I use.  Dark text blends in with the dark colors and light text blends in with the light colors.  I guess it's my fault cuz I didn't really think of that factor when I requested it.  So unfortunately I can't use that one. But don't worry about making a new one, Miana.  It's not a big deal.  The site that I was gonna use that green bg on was one that I don't work on much, anyhow.Anyway, the purple one is fine. This is my website if you want to see how it looks//members.tripod.com/tiarra2/

Woah!  Sweetness!I love the armor!  Well, I love the whole thing, actually.  But the armor is really cool.

That's beautiful!  Of course, all of your work is beautiful.  But I really like the design of that dolphin. And the colors.Hm...what's turpenoid?

dont worry trelluis i switched them around.theres a couple of problems with the story. Arkonviox cannot take off his armor. its apart of him. also even if he could only he can benefit from its power.I think now is the time for a mass killing spree. o.o~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ecco looked to Arkonviox. They were right in front of the time machine and ecco was ready to take on Arkons armor. Whitefin didn't understand why they stopped but she continued to be a obstacle past them.Arkonviox looked around and felt a presence. "Seven Dark Shadows....seven dark whales...seven for the secreat never to be told."Ecco was confused but then seen what Arkonviox was talking about. Seven orcas surrounded them and they didnt even know it. Whitefin looked in back of her. "Halt, do not disobey the princess of Atlantis."A dark orca swam beside her and she seemed aggitated. She was ready to attack though..but she wasnt watching in back of her. To her surprise a dark orca came behind her and bit her intire backside off then his eyes glew red as he lifted a red electrical charge and burned up whitefins remains.The deadly orca looked at Arkon just like the others the orca was completly black with three pupils in his eyes. each pupil seemed to pierce the others with an intimidation that this orca was watching everything and ready to slice anyone who oppose it.Miana looked over what was going on and decided this was no place for her to be. she swam away never to be seen again. meanwhile Atolm and crestoe showed up. ecco looked at arkon insisting if he was gonna wear his armor he would need it now. Crestoe looked at Ecco. "what are you talking about? arkon cannot give you his armor its apart of him."Arkonviox smirked. "damned strait"Arkonviox formed a small light which glew like a star over his head. he heald it up much like a seal holding a ball. the star grew into a giant blue sun and absorbed energy all around it. Crestoe yelled out "Arkon what are you doing?! your gonna kill us all..."Atolm looked at crestoe "what is that?"Arkonviox looked to atolm...."my ultimate slap in the face....i call it the bitch slap.."Crestoe looked at atolm "no. thats his deadilest attack...the supreme."Arkonviox threw the attack downward the dark whales moved out of the way.The giant sphere of light and energy consumed atolm ecco and crestoe killing them all.sete and soraris swam out of know where to tackle arkon but arkon just moved out of the way as they fall into the firey glow of the ultimate supreme which consumed them dead.Arkonviox laughed but then Ecco emerged from the light. crestoe too them emerged badly wounded and whimpered away. then Arkon closed his long fins like a bird does during flight when it has just pushed wind beneath it. Arkonviox them opened his fins and let out a fury of energy rockets. ecco moved out of the way them atolm emerged from the attack wounded only to get torn to shreds by the fury of the energy rockets.Crestoe looked at arkon "you missed us you idiot!"Arkonviox laughed "but your still wounded down to your last life and i managed to kill everyone else."The seven dark whales gathered around the supremes deadly glow as it died down.Crestoe yelled to arkon "so....your with them...you sell out."Arkonviox laughed as the dark whales captured ecco, crestoe dragging there wounded bodies away.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the reason why you couldnt add it vantid was i took your gallery down temporarly since it was empty.i still have many peopels old artwork i plan to readd later.anyways vantid its back up and i added your pict to it. you can always add your own stuff too.http://www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.php&amp;set_albumName=album29

<div id='container'>
Just thought id update.i been still working on the undercaves skin. right now the skin can alternate menu  backgrounds (netscape and other browsers dont have this feature yet.) or you can change which panel you use. for example if you hate using the start menu style menu you can use the crummy one i provide for netscape users. im trying to get the accurancy of the undercaves. after i do that im gonna get to work on the ultimate skin. then a new one crest made called stillmatic.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
-_- fixed it
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
------&gt; Hold on Arkon I was busy with this while you posted so could we fit it in before your last post please? Thanx!&lt;------I agree with eh....Moron...   Why not stick with the story untill it is well under way and then add new characters periodically? Anywayarrowarrowwink:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow!! How cool, Trell! :D And because my e-mail has decided to hate me today, thankies so much for my pic! ^_^ I love it! You did a great job on the CG, and I really love the effects you used for the background.The same thing happened to me once when I was in 8th grade - I slept on my neck all funny, and the next morning I couldn't even turn my head from side to side without it hurting. X_x
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, Cally...thaty is so awesome! I remember some of your old art, and I really must say, you have really improved! Keep it up!

<div id='container'>
this is a fan game that was released on the undercaves when it existed i was gonna put it on my site but must of forgot about it.Anyhow it was done by a guy named gustaff and he used some gamebuilder to make it. meaning he didnt program it. i played it before its kinda fucked up but its alright.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I am in the works of another one but this time a Jaguar, most  likely in Aztec style.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Point in fact Tursiops, the "Win32" problem probably means the download got corrupted somehow, try DL ing it again, then you WILL need to get the RTP installer since it needs certain library files which standard PC's may not have (I think I still have the installer here somewhere and will check) , and by the by, the game is not dead, I am working on continuing it from where it was left off. It is taking a little long because I dont have the tools he used to make it, but it IS loosely based on C++ so I'm doing it the hard and slow way. But it will be finished, and if Arkon will grant the webspace it will be up on the site for all to enjoy. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Many thanx Arkon, hmm now that I get the hang of this I am rather enjoying it!

The part that really grabbed my attention was the coloring in the hair... that looks magnificent! The little highlights and different colors. Very nice indeed. After seeing it so many times now, I have to ask... where did you and Cally get that funky writing you always put on your pictures?! Did you make it yourselves, or do you just make it up on the spot? Whatever it is, it's a very cute font!

You'll get full credit, of course, and links back to your webpages if you'd like.Sure thing, Kitnee!  You didn't even need to ask.Oh and those bot look great, Kit and Trel!  Those are some cool characters you guys got there.

<div id='container'>
Woah!  That is awesome, Cally!Hrm...I have no money.I know how you feel, Sten.  I could nver sell my drawings, either.  They are priceless to me.  I doubt anybody would buy them, anyway.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's very pretty, Trel!  I love the colors.  And that bg is really cool!  How did you make that?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OK, Teth! ^^Heh, it's funny - I haven't been on Furcadia since my dad went into the hospital - that was nearly 5 months ago - but tonight I went back for the first time since then. Like I never even left, although my classic wings did expire. ;_; And I dun have $15 to renew 'em fer the year, either. XO

Here me out please Its a lot to read, but its just explaining what to do Great job! to the always welcome Instead of just drawing a nice picture, I want you to draw a nice picture that means something a little more to you. There is a theme, or a story or any kind of concept behind your art. Of course it doesnt have to be a picture! Post poems, short stories, speed drawings, comics, anything artistic. This is all about expression! Its kind of like talking whats the use in speaking all the time if you have nothing to say? Just do something that means something more then what it looks like.When we hear a song on the radio, it can move us and strike our emotions; but no matter how much of an impact that song has on us, it can never mean to us what it means to the writer. It can be just as powerful in a different sense, but there is no way to know exactly what it meant to the author of the song. It is the same for all art, and what we want to get out of this what it means to others.How the hell is this gonna work?Well heres how this is gonna workhttp://beisick.dolphinparadise.net/home.jpgAnd if you have a picture, feel free to give us a title or a small caption on it!So I called this one This is My Home. Now you guys can tell me what you think it means, or what it means to you and how big or small an impact it has and blah blah blah (of course the artist will also be involved in these discussions). So then I can say, well what this is about (to me when I drew it) is that I think it is important to take a piece of your home with you wherever you go. Now matter how far or how different a live you are going to, it is necessary to remember where we came from -good or bad- in order to grow. Ta-da! Now you can feel free to discuss that further, or start something new for us to discuss!Of course, if you think that what you have done should and will be discuss a lot, post a whole now thread for it! Just make sure the subject includes the words Skin Deep so we know what its about. But if you have something small, or something you dont think can be extremely expanded on, feel free to keep it in this thread.Do we all understand? If not, Ill clear it up, and if so let anyone be the first to start us off!!!

i don't know if we're having the same problem but its not working for me either. it tell me that this program is not a valid win32 program. how do i fix it?I got that error message, too - "Not a valid Win32 application."This might help (probably)........ What "Windows" version have you got?the reason I'm asking this is because I used to have" Win98" when I downloaded the game, and it DID work. Now that I have "Win2000" version, I didna' bother about it, anyway...

<br />
<div id='container'>
Hi Stenellya (God this is confusing!!! I've used this name for every forum, I don't wanna change!  :D  )The tractor beam, harness, is gathered at Shrine of Controvercy. Look through walkthroughs to gt to it.Then, it u sonar something three times, you can pick it up.

No atolm. Stenella and Stenellya have to have a deathmatch, over a pit of boiling lava. There can be only one.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Deathmatch, I say. That will clear things up.

If indeed its a valid EXE, then its probably a win16 exe, and on XP I don't think theres a 16bit layer anymore. Go find a DOS emulator if you want to run it on XP.Yet another reason XP doesn't reside on my of my systems.

<div id='container'>
Yeah! I love the Final Fantasy thing! I've seen that a zillion times... I just can't get enough of it. But hey... I know all those characters too. &gt;D FF just rocks. I love the part with Quistis. :bI've never seen that RE one before though! That was great! I havn't played the new one, but the end part on Code Veronica was fucking hilarious. W00t! Show me more!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No atolm. Stenella and Stenellya have to have a deathmatch, over a pit of boiling lava. There can be only one.Yes, you're right, Pho ! This forum isn't big enough for a Stenellya and a stenella !!!!!!!And I WON'T GIVE UP MY PLACE TO A NEWBIE !!!!!Hey! It is Sten! Now we have two Stenellya/stenella here! 00: Anyways welcom to the site, to avoid confusion I dubb you little Sten since the other one is older. =D...You hurted me, Aty...There IS JUST A STENELLYA, HERE !!!!!

<div id='container'>
So, what do you say of what I explained, Oxy ?..  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Jeezus Stenellya im pretty sure the point would have gotten across without all of the caps and exclamation points and retarded logic.  A name is nothing to look like a jackhole about.Arkon, how do you allow idiots like this?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thats great Atolm, Stenellya is happy   O_oDamn, English is your mother language, after all !Aren't you supposed to speak a little better ?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey do we still have an avatar archive?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Trellius?  What are you Gustaff or something?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, dont listen to little sten.  OrcaCaller was right.The labor harness tractor beam can also be used to move mines around in perpetual fluidity, and those little eels in the giant crayfish boss fight as well.  I thin it can move sharks, but i forget.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Leave now? Never!    Just call me 12Sten okay? I'm 12.  8)  so whatever.Now i ca see Stenellya is mad at me.    Great. I got Stenella from the sientific name from a striped dolphin, so shut up!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm 12, don't worry    uhhhhhh I was meaning to u if u didn't know.God Now is time for me too leave!

^^ thanx cally, id love to do one for you :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
o_o; Good gravy, once again I find myself agreeing with histronic.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
good idea doom. ive been thinking about the same thing, but you worded it better than i could have XDnow about what you said.i think its more to remeber your home than "bring it with you". although, they're the same thing in a way. im not saying brining your home with it is haveing a floorboard in your backback all the time or something o_O but you're right, its good to remeber your past experiences so you can learn on them. history repeats itself they say...perhaps if something bad had happened to you in your home life, youll try to avoid it when you have a family of your own.or something like that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
...Nice stuff...dude! *grins*....*runs off cackling like an idiot*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Very sad Stenellya.I go to a chatroom that is hosted by orcalab www.orca-live.netwww.orcalab.orgAnd the group of people that go there are calling themselves "The orca people" and I'm part of it, we all agree on how captivity is not a good life for orcas, ad that they should be realesed, excpeccially corky. I've met Cory before many times. Learning about her once faimly in the wild that lives in Johnstone Striat (vancouver) that I have learned the sounds that they make.Just to know that i hear them at sea world too, coming from sad corky....and I'm going in a couple of weeks. I'll sing to her, maybe she'll sing bback? cry:

what the $%#$?it looks like something for 0.2 year olds. Its sooooo wierd and stupid.  :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hey!    U can sonar the sharks and make them stay where they are, but I don't think you can move them.  :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Okay. Everyone shutup. Congrats on being here. But I dont like the way this topic is turning.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Shutup and bow down to the glory of pokey the penguin. *Bows*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, the sharks only stay in place when you snoar them if you've got that shark song. It doesn't have anything to do with the tractor beam thing.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have Win98, too, and it doesn't work for me. o_O
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*high-fives Alastor, grinning* XD! Hell, yeah!Now...I agree with both Trell and Doom. It's important to bring a bit of your past with you and to never forget it. And never burn any bridges because you never know when you might need to cross them again.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
o_O; *is speechless, and swims away, shaking her head*

I like the drawing. It uses nice colouring techniques, and stuff like that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Stenella, While I usually refrain from regulating the discussions of the off-topic forum, I seem to have had this discussion before. A fragmentary fact and an opinion do not make truth. Try using your left and right eyes sometime, rather than copy-pasting what you read on the internet and see on TV.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I couldnt let you get the last word phosis. but as a moderator you did a pretty good job of secureing things.first i must answer histronic. the reason i allow people like that hist is because if i banned them all i wouldnt have no fun down the road. i mean look at dreadlord and compare him to my signature. where would be my amusement. anyhow stenellYa i just want to tell you even though your a friend of mine its against my supreme policy to attack new member. only i can do that o.oso you eithier put up with the fact you got compition or your gonna have to become a new member of COH with eao.

you mean with prebuilt avatars? no but if people want it people shall receive it.

I think Ihave seen that beastie before in one of Cally's pics? Was it pink or purple? Aw well I dun remember..... Anyways, cool piccy!Lately I have been told to try to sell my art too.... Dun know if I am up to the task.... What the heck is one suppose to do? *scratches head*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I believe the picture represents the fact that the person in the pic carries her home all in the bag. The tiny house can easily be picked it, in other words, carrying your home with you.

Eee *squee* I'll have to give you the pic of the outfit ^_^

Well, that's interesting.  I was thinking she looked lonely.  Something about the expression.  And I thought maybe it conveyed homesickness.  Or that maybe she had problems at home and is running away or something.Guess I'm the odball in the group, being the only one to come up with a negative interpretation.Well, as for thia idea, I think it's a cool idea and I like it.  I just can't draw anything that has any sort of meaning to it.  I sometimes come up with ideas, but never anything I could actually do.  At least not without it looking like total crap.  I write poetry sometimes, but not very often, and it's mostly about nature and stuff so it doesn't really have much personal meaning.But, it's still a good idea.  I can at least participate by giving my ideas about stuff that other people do.

Hello phosis those are AWSOMEEEE.......Better than any of mine  :)

Sten I don't exactly know of any arkon pic, but Atolm, send to me 2!! :) I would love it!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'd have to agree with all of ya, IGN used to be awsome. But now its a load of crap, or as you all say, shit! because now you cn't even get to the GREAT ecco walkthroughs located on the site, u have the sign up and get a load of shit mail in your email and I don't know, but do u have to pay? And who wants to pay to make a review?! Thats just nonesence! STUPID IGN! I can't get anything there! And u can only view 5 pics a day? What a Fu#ky ripoff!!! No wonder ya'll really hate this site!I'm in With ya'll!  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I welcomed you back once before, but as moderator it is my solemn duty to do so again. (That and it has been pretty dull around here lately, and that you were the first forum member I really had conversations with when I first got here) So Welcome back!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
(original post edited to remove sticky)Stenellya, until the time comes that two people can have the same name on a forum, I wouldn't worry. People just need to get less lazy when to comes to typing out names.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, a lot of old people coming back these days.  Maybe Arkon's best friend Debaser will come back too.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You're completing someone else's game?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i dont see that happening.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yes but in ecco there is no such things as a god =).and if your thinking certain characters in my stories are gods they actualy arent most of them have origins that make them seem godlike but relly they arent.so phosis your characters are deasd callyfin you still have a chace for revival since your character can be reborn. but be warned you can have a character that can come back a million times but if they arent doing anything important in this story i can do much worse then kill them. i can seal them up into a glyph which they cannot be released from until a billion years has past. or seal them in a glyph that only a certain key glyph can open then have arkon or someone destroy that key ;)now to conintue.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Atolm a sea creature who roamed about was killed. Callyfin an atlantean princess killed. sete and sosaris killed (or phosis if you think they went back to heaven and bring them back i will have arkon travel back in time to there birth and have arkon kill there mother.) miana is still around but vanished. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Crestoe is still alive, ecco is still alive. and have been captured by arkon.and the clan of seven dark whales.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The dark whales escorted ecco and crestoe to a dark lair which only crestoe knew about.crestoe: where are you taking us?the leading dark whale answered."were going to thira, isnt that where your from?"crestoe didnt hesitate to answer.the leading dark whale smirked at crestoe."were gonna kill every single thirian that lives in your city. that should be every thirian...well hunt them to extinction! and you'll get to witness the whole tragity."a dark orca withen the group looked at crestoe as if he had sympathy for crestoe and didnt want to do what he was doing.crestoe looked at the dark orca."who are you?"the orca looked up at crestoe and remained silent for a second. then the orca spoke when no one noticed."Dark Orca..."crestoe clared at the orca looking for a real name."Battino...was my name at birth...."Ecco went up to one of the larger dark orcas in the group looking for answers."I see you don't understand why were doing this but were trying to prevent a future that just might be. our leader thorax has prophised a future ruled by dolphinkind which oppress every other species in the sea. but one day one will rise and change that. he will liberate our oppressed orcas from the dolphins and he will be known as the apacalypes."the orca smirked at ecco."were gonna prevent this future from happening...by destroying the main dolphin who started this...and destroy the race of dolphins who aidied in making it possible decendants of atlanteans."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~to be continued.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED??? you killed off everyone! and to top it all of, you killed them with a bitch slap (call it wat u like - im stiking with bitch slap!!). im glad i didn't add my character yet. you can't kill moonflash that easily anyway. my posting here is not an addition to the story. i want to sort everything out. who is dead and who isn't? who is where? from what i remember atolm was with those 2 dolphins from space, ecco was with some1 else in the asterites home, arkonviox was in atlantis. but im guessing now they were all in atlantis rite?arkonviox is sum kinda baddy now? then why did he get everybody to come to atlantis to fight the 7 orcas?wasn't the whole idea of ecco getting that second life so that when arkonviox gave ecco his armour, ecco would still be around? and arkonviox would only get ecco number 1 and not the other one?i was thinking maybe this would be a good time to add moonflash as once he get the crystal shard back, he can travel thru time. just don't add him yet (i don't want him dead b4 i can even right a single post on him)why'd you kill everyone? it doesn't seem very friendly...whose character is crestoe? and why'd you let him live instead of EVERYONE else?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
using my crappy isp, it takes ages to load this better be worth it or there will be some bitch slaps liberally dished out

<div id='container'>
Downloads are coo.  I'd like some too.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
This isnt an RP. Arkon can do whatever he wants in his part of the story. Sete sosaris ecco and atolm are dead. (I think) Since sete and sosaris are gods, they just go back to the heavens anwyays. Arkon is an all powerful being in the story, so thats why that happened. If you dont like it, then shutup.
</div>

thymetraveler. I rember you. Welcome back.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Stenellya you flip out over stupid crap like every day.  You don't need to apologize.  We've kinda gotten used to it.*Trellius whips out his "Historic-speack-translator*what historic is ACTUALLY trying to say Sten, is that he understands completely and gives you his whole haearted support.  wink:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hiya guys...Then...I wanted to talk about my reaction when Stenella arrived on the forum.First, Stenella, I know that "Stenella" is the scientific name of some dolphin species (like Stenella Longirostris or Stenella Attenuata).My username, Stenellya, comes from this scientific term too.In second...I had a pretty stupid reaction, coz I was angry to know that someone else took my name.But now it's done, so I have to accept it, even if I don't like it...So...Stenella, let's make the peace...I've been stupid...I also reacted badly because I was afraid to be kinda "replaced" by someone else, I was afraid to lose the love and friendship of my friends on ark.com ...    You mean something special for me, you're my "pod", a "second family" on Internet; and I feared to lose you all.....    ...Please excuse me...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, Tre's back for another round of Arkon.com. Writing's not done yet but I have a pretty good idea of what's going to be done.In the mean time, I've started assembling sprite comics, and I now have a gallery set up by Phosis. My old one is in there already, along with the first of my new set. I have a few done so check it out for updates and tell me what you think.That's that. I hope to be around more often.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Stenellya you flip out over stupid crap like every day.  You don't need to apologize.  We've kinda gotten used to it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah Sten! I didn't see whatever happened between you and Stenella yet,but whatever it was let's have no hard feelings! You've been around way to long, and put it way too much to ever be replaced. So don't worry about that ever happening! Whatever it was that happened between you two, I'm sure will blow over. And besides... remember that if you're friends here are really good friends, they would never dream of replacing you. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You are TOOO good!  D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Of course we'd never replace you, Sten! Doom is right. You're our very good friend, you've been for a long time,  and no newbie with a name that looks like yours will ever replace you.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wheee! It's Mr. Art!! Glad to see you back! ^^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey Artreus! Good to have you back!And geez... I forgot all about those spites! I wonder if Arkon still has all the ones I made? Maybe we can bring em' back in action.But anways... nice to have you around again, and I hope to see more of you!
</div>

That's one of the major problems with Newgrounds - if all you have is a dial-up, it takes forever to even connect to the site.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Histronic is....Partly right.You have been here for a helluva long time. Far longer then me, or Stenella.Over stupid crap like that there is no way you could get canned from this site. You contribute so much.But do as youve been doing, and follow the rules. Everyone is happier that way, and we can keep a friendly forum.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I'm glad you guys like the idea! I was afraid no one would want to read all that and just reject this whole topic. But it's good that people are participating (and me and Trell had a similar idea ^_^)! Thanks a lot everyone!And as for the discussion so far, it seems we have the general same ideas on my picture. It's all about your roots really. You can't grow without 'em! And Tethys, your idea is totally viable! And I think it's good that you got something different out of it, cause... that's what this is all about!But we don't need to waste our time talking about my picture (unless someone has something they would like to say, go right ahead!), I'd like someone else to do something we can start with! Get those idea's going people! I can't wait to see.

No worries here!heh, I have no idea how long everyone has been part of the forum, i have only been here for what? *counts fingers* 7 months? I betcha you have been part of this place far longer!I am still kinda new eh?Dun worry about it Sten, you have been part of this forum for some time now, I do not see how you can be replaced.Of course getting new people into the forum would be nice too. =)I remember I was so hesitant about joing this place since I have never been part of the any forum.  I am such a shy person.... -_-Anyways, I am glad this little tiff is  resolved.

<div id='container'>
Hey, yeah I remember you! Welcome back!

<div id='container'>
Not quite resolved yet.  I'm still trying to figure out how using a name that is kind of similar to someone else's "replaces" them.

7 Month? I didn't think it was that long. I thought I had only been here like 7 months. Well look at the time fly by, huh? Pretty soon...I'll be dead. Hooray!

Heh, thats cool Arkon :) I'll make sure that when I bring Whitefin back she'll be put to good use 0o;;~~~"and Who is this Dolphin exactly?" Crestoe snorted, snapping his long jaws shut when Battino turned to face him. "Dolphinia" he simply said. Ecco felt his blood run cold, he looked to the surface of the water, the sunset above casting pale orange water webs across his body. They couldn't, could they? Ecco let a stream of bubbles emerge from his blowhole, and surfaced, looking at the night sky that was starting to take place, the light of the stars where bright, even at this hour in day.  Above him he saw the seven stars that where known as Dolphinia, smiling down at him brightly. "Hey brat, get back down here!" One of the Whales bellowed from below. Ecco grunted, taking a long, deep breath of fresh air, before diving below the surface again.

Meanwhile Arkonviox was sitting in his lair pondering deeply on how to go about the destruction of the Vortex King. When suddenly a bright light filled an entire half of his lair. a tall human with red hair floated in the center of the mass."Fool" the man said "you have let my future be destroyed, and for what, your own personal gain, so you will be the hero that destroys the vortex king, i will live my life to its fullest making sure that you are known as 'Arkonviox the deciever' you shall not be a hero, much less a suffering peon hoping to gain his way back into life, any honor you once had as guardian of atlantis, is forever lost!"Arkonvix glared at the stranger, dressed in black "who are you and why have you come here if not only to birate me?" he said"I am Thyme, son of Leonus, creator of the vortex race, i am not a god, nor have i come to birate you, i come only to warn you, your time for judgement is coming, beware of ecco for he has the power of the asterite, this you cannot defeat.""I am Arkonviox i will defeat who i will", with that arkonviox hurled his massive head at Thyme, missing him and thyme picked up his sword which was called WhaleHammer, it looked large enough, it was much to heavy to be wielded by any human though, it had a blue translucent blade with a streak of red in the center. "you are seeing the blade of Leonus, this you cannot beat." he yells.then leonus raised his sword and began slashing arkonviox repeatedly into tiny scattered pieces. and as the pices began to regenerate into Arkonviox, Thyme scowled at the face of the monster and said "i leave you now fool of fools, go back and ponder the defeat of the Vortex King, but always remember the words i have said here." Thyme stepped back into the light and it shrank to the size of a pea, and then unknowingly to Arkonviox it dropped to the bottom of the lair to the carcass of whitefin and the light and whitefin disappeared.later on a distant planet of war a light passed through a grat white tower in the sea, and thyme jumped free, "hello father, i have brought you the body of whitefin as you requested, unfortunately arkonviox is still alive, and the asterite was nowhere to be sensed.""i feared this would happen" the tall man with gleaming white hair said "it is time, come we will warn the Vortex King"Theres my not so little addition to the story, i hope you like it, and i hope arkon and whitefin dont mind me taking control of their characters. :)

The tabletop RPG "Blue Planet" has a new supplement book, "Ancient Echoes," focusing on the cetacean civilization in that setting. "Blue Planet" is a well-developed SF setting on an ocean world, and might appeal to gamers wanting to play dolphin or orca characters... missile racks optional. I've found the main Player's Guide worth reading even though I've never played the game.Of course there's also "GURPS A Game of Species and Civilizations," because it's a unique and well-developed fantasy world with a well-thought-out magic system. Um, no 'phins in it, but there are two races like hyperactive shapeshifting otters and hovering octapi!

Not quite resolved yet.  I'm still trying to figure out how using a name that is kind of similar to someone else's "replaces" them.it is probably that the names are so simular that it will be easy to make mistaken identities. aw well, that gives avatars their own personal purpose I suppose.

A roar. That was all it could be classified as. A bubbling cry that rose from the depths of a crevice beneath where Ecco and the whales now swam. The rocks began to crumble as a large quake tore through the small space. The roar came again, and it gained definition. It was desperate, a plea of anger, sadness, rage, and pain. Another quake moved through the earth beneath the water as Ecco and the whales began to back away, slowly at first, but almost franticly in reaction to what came next. Clawing sounds could be heard, bone against rock. Whatever it was, it was coming closer, they were sure of that now. The roar came again, and with it, a large blue three-fingered claw stuck out from the space between the rocks. The claw grabbed at the rimming of the rocks, of its cage, its prison. Finally, the claw went down for a moment, and all was quiet. For many seconds there was no sound, no movement. All at once, there was a large crash as the roar sounded itself again. The origin of the frightening sound could now be seen, however, as the rocks gave way to a large light blue colored creature. Its wings were bound to its back in a seemingly painful position, one of its arms also stuck in the strap. Its mouth was bound in a similar fashion, and its legs could only kick while its tail moved about hurriedly. The creature was no larger than one of the whales, but its distinguishing horns and spike running down its back, on its head and on its tail suggested that the creature was dangerous. The creature wasnt normally, but any animal bound and scared would be. It roared, flailed and tried to escape, but could only manage to entangle itself more. A loose wire on the straps caught it in the neck, and with each jerk of its tail, it dug it deeper into the skin. With everything going on at once, the trapped animal could only mutter a few words through its brace.Out! Let me out!

well one is Arkon's Sten, the Other is Psy/Silver's Sten.one is French, the other is AmericanOne is 12/13 the other (14?)one is a butterfly dolphin the other is a "striped atlaintan"(am I the only non-atlantian?)and um...well the both are hyper defencive on the animals they love.  I was confussed for a long time.what the other could do, prehaps is make the user name...uh....the secondhalf of the aninmal's name(wow so many sciency names here)the downside is "what it translates to"I know "ops" is "face" and the Bottlenosed is Turciops....or what ever...so...then I suppose the name says it all in anycase some of these may not be latain...eo is from Eos, the greek dawn goddess...and eao is my take on it."name nabbing/knocking off" is prehaps like soul stealing.and one could act like the other (my Ip "thought" it was somone elses, I chatted with somone for a half hour and they though...no the FAUGHT over the fact that i was this person..so if somone dosen't belive you are you...well...thats just stupid)these language translating pages aren't finding any of these wordshttp//www.isgs.uiuc.edu/dinos/dml/names/instruct.htmthis is very good for you dinolovers. it will teach you how to say the names

eao theres a difference between you and trelluis though.trelluis hasn't shown us a small bit that his new handicap is holding himself back. if anything he's learned to deal with it and not let it hurt him....so why cant you? i understand your on a small bit of life and i do feel sorry for you. but if your gonna go id rather remember you strong then weak and depressing. before you found this out you rambled depressingly about otherthings like you know where...but....when you werent you were a relly cool person. i think phosis has messaged you about this already...im not gonna ban you again i was hoping id teach you a lesson. as blackfin once told me the same applies to you...you are your worset enemy.

Arkonviox looked up and around.the dark whales were getting restless ecco and crestoe were ensnared by a dark creatures grasp. it was an underwater sea dragon who the dark whales new as cameroon. cameroon had white skin which was darkened by the deep abyss. no one could tell what he was but for sure he had ecco and crestoe in its grasp.Ecco refused to be dinner for this creature abd managed to break free. he focused his power onto cameroon...a sonar blast which has a power so immense it would confuse cameroon allowing ecco and crestoe to escape....and so ecco did it and so they escaped.the dark whales swam behind ecco and crest trying to capture them. Arkon watched not doing a thing letting them get away. Arkon was still confused by the wierd humaniod illsuion that came to him....perhalps it was an atlantean giving him a message...BUT arkon knew he wouldnt be the one to destroy the vortex king...he would be the one to save the future down the road and stop the apacalypes...for now he would serve the enemy but soon he would find a way to destroy his opressor....watching ecco...whos life was short...ecco wouldnt be around for the apacalypes....apacalypes the greatest of dark whales who would one day rule them all.Arkonviox smirked. poor ecco was just a pawn in this whole natural history....

Oh man. See what I miss when I'm away? What can I say that hasn't already been said? I'm not very good at these kinds of things...all I can say is that I'm very very sorry about what happened to you! It's so...wow. Shocking. And scary. You never think anything like that will happen to someone you know and love. But I'm so happy and grateful that you're still alive! What would we all do without our Trellius? You really are a hero.

It had taken a few moments, but now its mouth was free now, and it worked with it's teeth to free the rest of his body. It bit at the wire around its neck, and pulled it away. He then moved to his wings, releasing them from the imprisoning band. Finally, he workon the portions of wire and band that were on his tail. Once that was finished, he concentrated on his surroundings.The first thing he saw was Cameroon. The sight would have intimidated him at any other time, but in his enraged state he dove at the dark sea dragon, raming it head on. It only took a second to realize how stupid the move really was, and then he fled as well, following the path of Ecco and Crestoe. The only thing he could think of was getting away from everyone, then finding the person who held him captive. He swore it.

Oh god, its not that much different then making money off of incidents like pearl harbor and events in world war 2 to make money off of. Either way your taking things that affect peoples lives and making qa movie about it to rake in some cash. Its up to the people wether they want to see the movie or not. As for Extreme Ops, that movie fucking blew hard cock. It was terrible! And with that said, i didnt even pay to see that movie! I Snuck in. I payed to see Harry Potter 2, bitch. o_o;Anyways, whatever. Always with the activist topics in the Offtopic, i feel like im in a Stenellya topic.

Hey thanks guys, it's nice to be remembered. Barring technicall problems, I hope to add a new comic every-other day until I run out. I have ideas for about three more that I haven't started working on, and I want to act on them while I can. I almost couldn't get on today, but I tried one last time for the update.Writing has taken a back seat for the time being, but when it comes to mind I can be working on any one of four stories destined to end up here so the process is a little slow. More later

I think your art is just fine too Eao!Personally I believe that you should not compare your art to others. Oh yes, I have seen the art of Dark Natasha and it is very impressive, but you must consider the fact that not everyone is into the realism style. If you try to make your style to another's then you are just only hurting your own style, of course it is always good to explore stlyes as well. I have tried Realism, and while it was all good and fun, it is not the thing for me, to me it is just so common and tiring that I want to show something different. I did the style and I did not like it, it was just not for me.There are many great artists on this forum, each with their own method of drawing of what is going on in their heads. Hey that is all good because it allows everyone to see what is really out there. Do not hesitate to show your art on here becaues i am sure everyone will look at it and enjoy what they see. Such things allow me to continue with my drawings, I have doubted myself many times before, sometimes I wonder if any of you guys really like my art or you are just saying these kind things to me. But that is doubt that is looming there.So dont doubt your self Eao! I wanna see more drawings from you, and I will give you feedback if you need it. Feedback is always good, especially when it comes from other artists...meh.... i said too much.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Aww...I'm really glad to hear that, Sten!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No, At, you are exactly right. I don't think it's very fair to you if you compare your stuff with others. I mean, sure, everybody says at one time or another, "Oh, this artist is a way better drawer than me." But I think that you're not being true to yourself when you do that. You should be happy with your skills - I mean, look at me - At, Eao, vantid...there are a lot of people here who draw better than me. But I'm content with my skills. ^_^And Eao, I just love your stuff!! It's so cute! I like the Ecco as a human one. Rarwf. :3

back on the planet of war...Thyme walked down the gleaming halls, his father following closely behind."we have little time, you know what you must do?" Leonus inquired"aye father" Thyme replied"the dimensional gateway will close soon, you may not be able to return to us."Leonus said"do not fear father, they have a time machine, i may be able to refashion it into a gateway" Thyme Informed" you must hurry. time is against you, and the asterite has not fallen yet." Leonus said"okay, okay father, i know." Thyme complainedThey stepped into a large room with a huge bubble in the center. it seemed to float, yet it was supported by one short spire, with a thin point.thyme slowly walked into the bubble, took his clothes off, except his sword. his sword was different, it was not the WhaleKiller, instead he wielded the armor piercer. it was black, and had white where the blade was thinned.the operator said "okay sir, this will only take a second, please try not to move"the bubble slowly changed colors, from red to blue to red again, until finally it was no longer transparent but a silver ball of liquid. inside, thyme was being ripped apart, his whole body was being mashed, and pulled like silly putty, then his sword rammed through his chest and out his back to form a dorsal fin, his hands morphed into large flipper like wings, and his face formed to the shape of a dolphins.he swam out of the bubble in his new from, he was now of the earths future singers.he floated through the dimensional gate, and went to earth for his last time.

Arkonviox looked up feeling a presence unnatural. a being from another demension has appered but this creature could have been linked with the vortex since that race of creatures live only for survival.two threats bod near and a third awaiting in a distant future...the dark whale apacalypes.the sky was purple with a second red moon blazzing out of the sky. most of the singers of this time were ignorant of names....the planet to them was....dark clouds....the creatures who lived on it were eithier the vortex the foe or the threat...Ecco and crestoe managed to get away from the dark whales and found themselves in a group of dolphins. the dolphins were startled because they never seen a dolphin like crestoe. crestoe smirked. ecco and crestoe were in a sea called the mederteranian. another city lie dorment here without a name. ecco wondered why atlantis was scattered throughout the sea....and not in one place.Crestoe felt the need to answer him "atlantis was destroyed by the vortex king in the year 14,098 bc....the city was a floating island powered by the hanging waters generator. It was created by our dolphin ancestors known as the old world atlantean dolphins. back then we lived with creatures who dwelled the land with the ability to create massive machines. it was thanks to atla a scientist beyound anything that we have our technology. but it is also because of atla we have to deal with fools like arkonviox, dark whales, or anything that threats us with technology. the thirian kind..my kind are destined to destroy those in possession of the machine so we can liberate ourselves from the destruction it can cause."Crestoe thought to himself...."SHIT! my people are in danger...!"Ecco looked around part sof thira were scattered here...but thira was many amny amny many miles away. ecco also knew crestoe was eager to head back before the dark whales do."Ecco you have a mission to fafill nearby an acient dolphin people guard another time machine known as solomon you must get to it fast and travel back to the moment dark clouds decended over earth. the vortex king is collecting life on earth as we speak and growing massivly in power. only you can destroy him while he is weakened. you can do it ecco."Crestoe swam off on his way back to thira.Ecco was alone the time machine was far.....his mission was alot to think about but he went on anyways not pondering about it but planning on what to do next.

before I get scholded for a false alarm be reminded I'm on an AmericanPS2.this glitch is relitivly simple....jump over the waterfall.  Or more correctly "on top" of the water fall" because you'll roll around on some solid ground that has "water graphics"For more fun, grab the "helper dolphins" when you cross the waterfall they may depart, but will be near a rockk wall very close to where you fall.You easily return to the level by messing with the current near the sharks (there is a rock thats half in and half out of the 'level'.  Just talk to the coach to return the players/helpers to your side (they teloport from nowhere)also, I'm trying to see how long I can go without the "game playing by it's self" when the mother whale blocks the current (waterfall). you can get to the player dolphins (I didn't find them)  I'd like to see them by your side when and if the game 'warps' you to the next level.

<div id='container'>
Yeah thanks guys! I can't seem to think of any creative names right now that would still let people remember who I am. Unless I anounced it to everyone. I think I'll just have to stick with this for now...I guess my face pic would give it away, huh?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow thanks...one thing i "need" is painter 7.  the newist picts (worm hole and the group) 's backgrounds were done there (must rob the school)one thing i cannot get down is the values....warm cool, cool and warm which is which?purple is one violet is another...crimison and....carimine red it's as mind boggling as falling asleep and lossing your self in 5 windows! not to mention changeing your text color in COH's forum. sea green dosen't werk.althou i do have a good 'red casim' dolphin, I've discoverd through eao (her monster form) that the reason my dolphins were messed up was that "i made the subtile detail subtile" (that word that is like 'slight').  I tryed drawing from a 1993 or so callander (one dolph looked sick..his chin was chewed and his mellon had ridges, yet it was wild)so, with the arms we make them "arm like and beefy" with a long thich finger.for the head you make a "bird beak"ah mabye I'll make "eao style" drawing, where I'll scan a photo and create a layer in PS showing what lines do what!I want to add a gallery to  a page but the php and programing may die because of my computer's incompentancy.PS:your page is slow to load on 2 computers Arkon, mine and the schools.

<br />
<div id='container'>
all he needs is an adversary!(sp?)how about an evil hermphridte sheep warlock!  Or...wood chuck theif hauwhahaa *dies*his head seems slender for a wolf..but who am I to say, a friend of mine use to always knock on my woulf heads "the forhead isn't big enough" (meanwhile wolf picts adorned her walls, and they had no protruding forheads)Ii tryed to draw a wolf.  making the eyes semetric is hard.  I take it you avoided that by drawing profile?I gotta get sum animals, if i do wildlife art i want new poses...like a three and two forths pose from above/below.for anthros ask some people to "strike a pose" then scold them for not giving me what i wanted.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm not positive on this one, Stenellya, but I'm pretty sure Arkon was making a JOKE.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Funny indeed. =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I added a new skin as you all can see. problem is im not sure how the new technology in it will work. its ment for ie only so you netscape users are just seeing a pretty look our friend silverfin made for us.The skin has wierd abilitys to let you "move" things like the sections and even the forum!you have to double click on an object to move it so thats basically how you do it.and if your wondering where i got the script to do this i didnt get it i made it. Anyhow just tell me what you think or if its not working. it will only be up for a day so not to worry you folks who love there other boring skins.oh yeah im still working on it so things like the forum colors arent finalized...but just you wait its gonne look awesome when im done.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
just tesing something.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The use of PNG8 is kinda interesting. Was the deliberate to get the whole palleted feel, or just a misunderstanding of the PNG format in general?The fact that it comes to 1024px wide is annoying but minor.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the top logo and the side column are actualy two images. the side column is actualy suppose to streatch down and im gonna have to work with it to trie to fix that.i decided to go with pngs cause they seem alot better then transparent gifs.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>

Heres a story I wrote.                                                                Prelude	Push your knees down more. Extend your arms.	It was this saying that Kai had heard hundreds of thousands of times already, in his seven years in the world. Sweat beaded on his forehead. His arms and legs were tired, and a burning sensation ran through him. His ankles shook, and he wanted to fall down on the school floor, and sleep. He was practicing the knee bend stance, and had been doing it for a long time now. It was a harsh training technique, but it was used by most teachers to train their students to be stronger. And in this school, also used as punishment, for putting off training, which Kai had been doing a lot lately.	The school was a large one, the walls lined with worn mirrors, the faces of many famous practitioners of the Huo Long Mountain Kung Fu style martial art, Huo Long being the name of a famous dragon God from the old world, Kung Fu meaning hard work in the common language. He was the fire dragon, who was said to have created all life on Earth, and the style had been passed down through the generations by priests, and monks, all over the world, and to this temple.	Huo Long Mountain was said to be the center of the universe, where the great dragon God rested, and watched over the world. Now, he slept eternally, becoming one with the stone of the mountain, to watch over the world until the end of time. 	It was all myths and legends, of course. Myths spawned through thousands of years of study and prayer to the God's of the old world. It was believed there had been five. Five dragons for the five elements of the world. Fire, Water, Earth, Wood, And Metal. They each played a part in the creation of Earth, the Fire dragon being the most powerful of the five.	The humans based most of their religion and culture on the theories of these five dragons. They called it Longism, and the main theory behind it was improvement on oneself. They believed in heaven and hell, but not in worship. Only by improving yourself, and becoming the best person you could, could you be able to reach the heavenly kingdom, and break the bondings of mortal life.	They were right, the Longist monks. Infact, many of them had gone through over fifty mortal lives already, and were getting quite bored of the living world. 	Kai didn't practice Longism. It was rare for such a young soul to believe in such things. What he did practice was Huo Long Kung Fu, and with much suffering. His father Chong pushed him hard to be his best, and at the age of seven, was Chong best student.	Don't forget to breathe. Chong said, stroking his long thin beard. 	He was a tall, lanky man, or so it appeared when he wore his robes. Underneath, he was very strong, and had a hard, worn body. Kai always remembered what his father had taught him about appearance. 	When you are out in the street buying pork buns, do you show everyone your allowance? Kai replied no, though this was not fully true. He liked to show his friends what he had earned for his work in the fields, and was proud when he had money. Then why would you show everyone how strong you are? If you got in a fight, and showed someone how strong you had become, you would lose the element of surprise. That is why we wear robes, and do not demonstrate our Kung Fu like some other so called Masters. This, I am sure you can understand.	Kai thought the lesson over in his mind. He was taught that last year, and he remembered it more clearly then most lessons he had been taught. And he never showed his money to anyone anymore. 	Remember to clear your mind, and let your Qi flow freely. His father said, as he observed his sons stance. 	One thing Kai still hadn't been able to grasp was the concept of Qi. It was said to be, or at least how he had analyzed it, as a spiritual energy that flowed through everything. For thousands of years, humans had studied Qi around them, and even learned to manipulate it, for health, and even combat. It was once more spiritual then today, used for religion, and to become one with nature. But in the dangerous world that this country had become, it was used more with Kung Fu, and had become more of a dangerous tool then a spiritual outlet. 	Kai sat in that low stance, feeling as if all of his muscles were tearing. He had been there two hours now, and while it was easy in the beginning, it was now unbearable. He looked as if he was pretending to sit in a chair, but with his arms pointed straight out in front. It was a stance used to gain strength in the legs, and build up the muscle there.	If you open up your channels, and let the Qi flow, you won't even need to use your muscles. It will become much easier. Only two hours, and already you look like your going to burst. The Bing Ge family, which was what they were called, had always been powerful martial artists. Kai's father was hard on Kai sometimes, but usually with good reason. The school of Huo Long Mountain style Kung Fu was always well known for it's rigorous training, and painful teaching, but it wasn't until recently that it had been accepting students not born with the Bing Ge name.	There was not just one school, or one type of Kung Fu in the world. There were many thousands of styles and forms, scattered throughout the country, and were all unique in different ways. 	The Huo Long Mountain school had competition. The school of Lei Shang Kung Fu was their greatest opposition, and the two schools had been fighting for years. The Lei Shang Kung Fu used the Thunder Kick style; a vast range of powerful kicking forms, used to quickly destroy the enemy. While Huo Long used a mixture of weapons, strikes, grapples, and kicks, Lei Shang was mostly just kicking techniques. 	Huo Long and Lei Shang had been in a deadlock for years, neither school having the advantage. So every year, the school would pick out their finest of students, and would send them to spar one another, to prove who the greatest school was. It had been a tie so far, and that trend didnt seem like it was going to change.	Kai had made friends with other children from the Lei Shang school. His closest friend and rival Kuai Jiao, was the youngest member of the Lei Shang school. His father, Kuai Kun had trained him to be the fastest and strongest of his twelve children, so Kai and Jaio would someday fight with each other.	That day was coming quickly. In just a few weeks, the first competition would begin. The competitors were Jiao and Kai. 	Kai wanted to fight Jiao, though they were friends. They had always trained together when they played, and though they were just play fighting, the both of them took it very seriously. The truth was, they were equally matched in skill and strength, but Jiao had one serious advantage. He could manipulate his Qi quite well for his age, and Kai could not.	Kai thought about his disadvantage, and began to ignore the pain in his numbing legs. He let it rip through his body, and fill his head with pain, but remained relentless. He would not be beaten. He would either last out the two minutes of the spar, which had happened year after year leaving no victor, or he would defeat Jiao. A few minutes later, his father said, Thats enough. And Kai immediately fell to the ground, rubbing his crippled thighs with his hands. 	Youre getting stronger, Ill admit that. But you have a long way to go yet. When I am finished with you, you will have to hold that pose for daysand you will be able to. His father gave him a quick pat on the shoulder, and walked outside, to tend his garden.	Kai stood up, and limped to the door. His grey robes wagged behind him, his one long black braid of hair bouncing on his back. He was young, but very well groomed and dressed. His eyes were a deep blue, and his hair was black. His eyes conflicted with his light brown, tanned skin, and made him look even younger then he was.	Outside, beyond the doors of the dojo, lay long rows of rice fields. Beyond that was the Huo Long river, named after the school. It ran far away, into the forest to the east. There were two bridges that crossed the wide river, all painted and decorated in bright, beautiful colors, connected by an arch in the shape of a dragon, which was made of gold, with parts painted red. There was another dragon arch on the other side of the river as well, and it was all built with great symmetry and care.	The twin bridges led out into another field, with merged with the forest town of Talon, about three miles to the north of the school. Smoke could be seen coming from the rooftops of the buildings there, floating deep into the sky. Kai looked beyond the smoke, to the great mountain range of Czu, which was far in the distance past Talon.	It was deep in that very mountain range, within the icy cold tops of the Czu mountains, where Huo Long mountain lay, high above the clouds. The region of Czu was a dangerous one. Getting through the hazards of the range was perilous enough. If one could make it through, and could reach the peak of the towering mountain of Huo Long, they would see the challenge they faced; a mountain with no visible top, that led straight up, in a vicious, icy slope. There had only been one person in the history of the world who had actually climbed mount Huo Long, five thousand years ago. He was called Wu, and was said to be one of the greatest practitioners of Kung Fu to ever have lived. No one recorded what he found, as he never came down from the mountain once he reached the top. Some say he found a cave filled with gold, and many magical things, and lived out the rest of his days in glory; others say he simply froze to death at the top. Kai believed he survived.	Kai reached into his pocket, and found a couple of brass coins. He smiled, and squeezed them happily, running over the rice fields, across the bridge, through the field there, and into the town of Talon.

Silently, stealthily, swiftly he swam beneath the dolphin known as Ecco. He knew who it was, everyone did, but his rage was forgotten. In its place came playfulness and joy, the eagerness of a journey now filling his mind. He was not shallow minded at all, he just almost never cared. However, the appearance of so many dark creatures, his capture, and now the arrival of Ecco, stirred his thoughts, and he decided to merely watch. In this way, if it was over his head he could simply swim away. On the opposite end, he could move into a position to help if that was needed. Ecco began to move in one direction, following one of the other strange looking dolphins, and he followed. He kept his thoughts short, his mind open and his eyes watchful. One couldn't be too sure in a place like this.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Atleast he didnt waiste his life making a topic.Edit: Dreadlord, why the hell are you using Warrior H's lousy avatar and signature? Get your own damn stuff.

I'm trying to make several skins for you to choose one from.  or ok...two skins a "stars" and a "simple City of atlantis" onepS all graphics here and on COH are red "x" boxes.why?
</div>

Eao, perhaps your browser is set not to downlaod graphics or perhaps just a certain type of graphics. Or it could be faulty, what are you using? Check your settings to make shure.

Does anybody here have an Live Journal with a free code? I want to get a code for my friend Dracona-fin, so that we can use it to keep in contact with eachother when she has to move to sydney, as her mom is dying, and she has already lost her dad. So, would anyone be able to help?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks. This time I'll be here to stay. :)

<div id='container'>
"Neon-pink-bitch-slap!" ?

<div id='container'>
A prismacolour joke &gt;:)ANyways, I'm going to work on some more skin stuff tonight, I feel graphic worthy today o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*Points at Boo, his miniature-giant-space-hamster* Trellius will lead with blade and boot!....Boo will take care of the details....(Where did THAT come from?! I dunno, just keep smiling, maybe he'll go away..) :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
All I can suggest is maybe signing on to dead journal. It's like Live journal except that it isn't, which would most likely complicate a friend's list. But, it's free, so a code isn't required. I can't help you if Dracona-fin really wants a live journal.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No, DJ's not free anymore - you need to pay for it now, unless you have a kode.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Kit, I think you've won your turn.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, nice to see you again Lizza. I've been having simmilar problems as you, but let's hope this works for both of us.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No thanx Dreadlord, i dont care. Besides, its just pictures of Siefer with your name on it. So lame.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
How about a skin with Ecco, or any other dolphin, in it? You know, swimming round the logo or something.  wink:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have to hand it to you Crest... you're flash work really is awesome! It looks very professional and smooth. Unlike most flash movies that just have a picture of a character with a black hole for a mouth. Very clean stuff indeed! I loved the work, and I'm ever waiting the new Grand Theft Yogaot! &gt;D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Konnichiwa! Welcome back Lizza!...No, that's it... just, welcome back! ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey Thyme! I too remeber you! Now you'll just have to ask yourself if that's a good thing, or a bad thing. ^_-Nah... but I do remeber you! And welcome back! You haven't really missed much... aside from a lot of crashing, it's been all good!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The slipstream created by the the new comer, the roar of the dragon, amplified underwater, the beating of the wings and the smell of freash blood. All these things together cuased a cacofany of confusion, but Ecco's mind was cristal clear. "The creature from the crevis." He recalled their first encounter not too long ago. With a powerfull kick he made his way to the surface, his eyes searched the strange sky and fixed at last on the hovering image of the large reptile. "Creature of the deep!" He began. "Calm your fury! This one is not with.....me, and I imagion it seeks to harm us both! I propose a truce, my power lies in the waters, yours in the air, let us aid one another now, lift me from the ocean and carry me to my destination, I in turn shall help you escape this place. More then this I cannot promise untill my quest has been fullfilled! Aid me in this task and we may yet survive! Do it not, and we will suffer a fate worse than old Atlantis!" Ecco paused waiting for a reply, then added as an after thought. "Delphinus smiles on us in this, we cannot loose!" "&gt;Unles the Powers decide this to be the end of our time....&lt;" He thought to himself....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah! I finally checked back again, and indeed it did work...and indeed it is an amazing picture! The style reminds me very much of the talented Vantid. The shading is brilliant! And I absolutely love the armour! Something I cannot draw it fancy patterns like you did. It looks wicked! Keep it up!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Unfortunately, I cannot help you with any journal... I simply wanted to offer my deepest condolences to your friend. I do hope she/he is alright.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Shut up... I call him Pho-Pho! Dibs! &gt;DNah... have a safe and fun trip. Merry Chirstmas and Happy New Years, man!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
0.0*laughs until her sides burst*Oh, man, that's wicked funny!  The look on Alastor's face...oh man...and the way Santa talked.WTF was he singing anyways?  lol:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
"He acts like I am on holiday! Swimming around having a bit of fun!" Ecco thought to himself as he swam. "I am not stupid Crestoe, do not make me think you are! Destroy the Vortex King? What good would that do? Would it not be wiser to go after Arkonviox first? Remove the tratorous obstical that is his carcas from the way first? And where am I? What garuntee is there that I will be able to return through this new machine?"Ecco was confused, bewildered, tired and hungry. Only recently had he become aware of the latter, and the need was now growing in intensity. Another thought returned to him and he slowed his pace, sinking a little. "Come from the shadows, whoever you are, come where I can see you." Ecco was addressing the nameless figure that had followed him so quietly the past few legues. "There is no malice in you, I think, or you would have acted already to hinder me. Show yourself creature, and perhaps we could be of some use to each other...."
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm, I would tell her to get a Dead Journal, but as kit said, its now nolonger free, and if she had an LJ, I could easilly add her to my friends list and we'd be able to view all the posts we make. I'll pass that along to her as well Doomy :) Shes coping well from what she told me last night over the phone. It was just when we found out her mom couldn't continue dyalysis, shock and everything just made her sick -_-; I'm going to head over there tomorrow to see and and Mary, so yay.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OK - I haven't heard from Sten in a while.  :? So I'll just go.QAIRABUNYAMEAIt's a level, two words.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's good, Cally. You should be there for your friend in her time of need. Tell her we're all thinking and praying for her. *hugs*

Histronic Posted22 pm    Post subject:  Awesome Dreadlord!! i really missed you!! No one caught my sarcasm, Stenellya and Trellius are confused as usual and Dreadlord's still an idiot.  This topic sure is riding down the shit tubes.

nicely done, I love the mangy-ish look to it!

He was unsure of what to do. Mystery was on his side here, and the less they knew the more could do. He could leave, and leave it at a guess with those he was following. Though if he was to find out what was truly going on...The shadow was scarcely larger than Ecco at first, but it grew larger, and ever larger, until it was several times the dolphins size. The creatures nose broke the waves first, then the long face and finally the neck. That was all he let above the water, save for one three-clawed hand. The creature was roughly about five times Ecco's size, shiny blue, with feet that waved beneath the waves, large wings that beat softly underwater, added to a long tail that moved slowly. Its voice was slow, diliberate, the sound very low but soft."You have called for me. Here I am."He looked from Ecco to Crestoe, then sank to  where only his head was above water.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Seeee, Trell? Your a hero dammit. As for you eao, You know what I said. No more crap. be strong, even though your having problems. You cant rely on anyone but yourself to help yourself. No God's or people can help you. Just you.On a lighter note, it seems Noriko is back. Are you back? If you are, you should make a post somewhere...Havent seen you in awhile.Update us on your progress, Trell. How is your healing progressing?Well, I'm kind of back...sort of...still very busy, but I'll be off for 2 weeks from school starting tomorrow. Perhaps I'll be able to get online more over my vacation?Anyways, yea, Trell, how's the healing process comin' along?

Leonus walked from the tmog room and as he walked he thought 'we will have to prepare for the arrival of the king soon'one of the lab assistanced asked what they would be doing with the body of whitefin. "clone it, and i need you to remote clone that Shamgar. we can still use them for our plan."Thyme swam around, looking for the infamous dolphin.'if only my powers hadnt been drained with that stupid healing. i should find a new form.'he thought. he swam on, he passed through a hole in the rock and found some nice blue coral. he looked at the surface of the water, he saw the lights sillhouette around two dolphins, one completely bare, and the other armored, and he saw the biggest water dragon he had ever seen.'hah! look at that, twice the size of my own dragon. i must capture this thing. if i cant take its form then maybe i can use it.'Thyme swam behind the reef and prepared for an attack.he charged though the two dolphins using his sword/dorsal fin as a razor, then he caught the dragon creature and began to swim away as hard as he could, the dragon struggling, and ecco and crestoe preparing for their attacks. But Thyme waas too quick, he had disappeared. but the dragon had managed to break free. Thyme decided then that this would not be the last time the dragon was captured.

One sentence. That was all he had managed to speak to the two smaller ones. No longer interested in forming words any longer, the water dragon roared loudly, one recognized by Ecco and Crestoe as the one the heard from the ocean floor. It dove deep, deep enough to touch the bottom so it desired, but this was far more important. Using its wings, feet, arms and tail, it propelled itself at an amazing speed toward the surface. He broke the surface seconds later. His momentum carried him high into the air, and he beat his large wings to keep himself airborne."Was that of your doing?"With that, he starred at the two little ones.

now now now, first off don't take this the wrong way ok?looking at http//www.lassenart.com/images/l/Leap%20of%20Faith.jpg reminds me of a photo I have 0_o  Then again there are those nasty "cliqushes" (sp)One person puts a whale in space, we all have to.  I've seen few dolphins jumping in sand and one out of spilt water froma  glass.2 nights ago I serched for "public domain dolphin images" and sadly got none, thus If i wanted to paint from a pic I'de either have to dodge lawyers or get my own whales.  (I was looking for an Arkon.com banner fodder)anyway can somone point me to some "ownerless" photos?  those few kind souls that gave up the're copyright on a photo for other's use?now as I said don't take it the wrong way...just more like "whutzzup wif all dez Lassen Knock offs"i wish I could be great.  people pay for a "name brand."  In art class once a man came in not looking for just wild life art, but Carol Decker's images.  She's not the kind of person whos been dead for 300 years, no but wower-willekers a print can sell for $500 a copy no less! heres her work! http//www.novaspace.com/POSTERS/Schimposters.html)sheesh this is enough to make a "wanna be relist" cry to death?  to happy your selfs i guess you can gander at my Okekikae (whatever) skills! and drool over my fusslinger skyies!  yess my skies are wooly...why?(oekeki at COH's Oekiie)repete do't take this the wrong way...this is an art post for the little guy out there, all of you forgoten artists being steped on by the pros while trying to make a name for yourself.  most angles of "over done" wild life i want may require me to work with taxerdermy'ed ones...which is easer to get than a living tigar.*adorns some antlers and leaves*

The great dragon surged further and further into the air, before releasing a roar of triumph. He unfurled his wings in a act of grace and magnificance. He launched his huge body skyward and after a spectacular feat of flight he returned to the ocean. In a far more controled way he turned to ecco. 'Dammit, don't you just hate it when you can't pop your ears?' The dolphin was puzzled for a momment but the dragon continued.'You think i need YOUR help in escaping??? I AM FREE, i need no one!' With that, he let loose a blast of fire large enough to scortch entire cities. 'I am not your taxi service, dolphin - you should be glad, it would be difficult to find a parking place this big. How about this, you bugger off and shit yourself or whatever you dolphins do. And i'll go off and open up a bigass can of whoopass on a few black orcas?' Ecco was annoyed by cameroon's apathy of what ecco was trying to say. 'The destruction of the world is immenant if we do not join together and fight this menace!' Now the huge dragon did take notice. 'Look dolphin, would it really matter if the world did end? like you i've lived a very long time. and for the last 3000 years i've been trapped by a magical force, in my opinion, this world doesn't deserve being saving. if you don't mind, im off to torch something or another, 3000 years really makes you wanna KILL! you can kiss my scaley ass!'With this ecco shouted back at the dragon. 'Look buddy, i don't care how big you are, you can die. If this Vortex King puts his plan into motion, you probably will die. Now, your probably right in thinking you don't care about your own life, and really, one less stupid lizard's not gonna take any skin off my ass.'Cameroon looked down at the tiny dolpin. 'okay you little shit. i'll take you where you wanna go. just don't expect me to sit around and play second fiddle to you!' with that he whisked ecco out of the water. 'Hang on, tight!' he shouted as he shot off into to the sky and did a few loops. as expected, a dolphin can't hang on - tightly or otherwise, and started plumeting downwards....

Many many days went by as a giant red star began to form into a giant second moon over earth which overshadowed the sun. The planet was silent but then a giant swarm of creatures flew out of it as giant tenticles emerged from the planet and attached to earths skys. from withen the tubes more swarms of creatures emerged. The creatures fell to earths seas capturing any life they could and returning to the tenticles which were tubeways that led back to the planet.The panet known to many as dark clouds where the vortex kind thrived feeding upon earth. Much of there technology was damaged but still functional. tubeways connected the alien hive which look like a giant city. though it was not a city for only a civilized race could form such a thing these creatures were drones who worked under the command of one. a creature known by the atlanteans as the vortex king. it was a giant beatle like creature brown in color connected to a giant machine which controled everything. the eyes of this monster opened red.when ever the vortex kings eyes opened it ment someone was going to die.....someone far off but who?a gateway opened to the planet of war. the vortex king seen ther eintire planet and became aware of there plot. the vortex king became aware of Leonus aware of there goals. they werent gonna get away with it.a New improved whitefin appeared in our demension connected to new technology. when the portal opened the king anaylized its signature.....the vortexs awareness of these intruders awoke a being from the distant future. he knew what he had to do.a gateway opened to the planet of war and out appeared the legendary great dark whale apacalypes. he had emerged from a future that hasnt happened yet. his interference in the past was a sign....and what he was about to do was send a message.Apacalypes wore gold metal armor over his dead orca body. his tetth were sharp and power immense. apacalypes looked down upon the planet of war and prepared for his ultimate attack. the oblivion.apacalpyes swam in circles forming a giant red fire which grew in size. the speed of this deadly god like orca was fast forming energy which this deadly attack of mass destruction was about to inflict. then apacalypes stopped. looke down which in turn directed the giant fire to fall. Leonus looked up it was headed for him and his planet. the attack fell right on him burning him into non existence then it consumed the planet and destroyed everything. Leonus and the planet of war was no more...nor would they ever come back.Apacalpyes vanished in an instant..the seven dark whales looked up. they felt his presence and there purpose became more clear. they were setting the stage for a future ruled by orca kind ruled by apacalypes. but they ahd apacalypes there now to aid them whenever they needed him. apcalypes became aware the vortex knew about this altered demension with a planet of war. he knew he had to destroy it cause they were a threat.apacalypes sent a message to thorax...the leader of the seven dark whales....find tyme and kill him....then find ecco.

Whitefin had appeared back on earth, and witnessed Apocalypse's destruction of the War Planet. She felt rage shift through her long body at the sight of this 'god' and charged - but he vanished before she had a chance to attack. Grunting with dissapointment, she swam out into the open ocean. She dove out of the water and hovered in place, before streaking across the top of the waters at neckbreaking speed, following her insticts - she soon found her way to Ecco, she dropped back into the water, aproching the legendary dolphin.

In what part of the world does orange rhyme with lozenge?  They sound nothing alike.  The only simularity is the "ng" sound.  Orange is like or-aynge and lozenge is more like loss-enge.  Well, I guess depending on where you're from they might sound more similar....Er...yeah, I know this is kinda stupid.  But you know me, I always have to say something.  Besides, I'm really bored right now and there aren't many topics today that I'm interested in replying to.  So....yeeaahh..... e.e;;;;;

my family lets us open 1 gift christmas eve about 9:00 pm. and all we gotta do is wake up mom and start unwrapping christmas morning

<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, we used to go to our grandma's house on Christmas Eve and open presents, but since she moved we don't anymore. On Christmas Eve we have an old fashioned Christmas where everyone buys a gift that would exist in the 1800's. You can't wrap it in regular paper, you have to use brown bags. 30 a.m. and it's present time!!!   
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
lol! She is an ancient atlantean, she has had her sabertooth since she was a baby and he was a pup. The Atlantean sabertooths are very different to some of the actual sabertooths - such as various markings and strange colours. They have a sort of beak with the fangs. Heh, I was amazed when I found out they where sabertooths in the movie, I was like - "dude, Thira needs one of those!" D

Anyway, is it possible to find it in stores?  Or do you have to get it online?In store? who knows... though... I FEAR you have to purchase it online (which I do not really "trust")... There was one time when I was in a certain CD store (where I live), I asked for it, and the person at the counter said they do (*the CD (which was IMPORT) is (was anyway) arround $39 and Tape is $29 dollars... still expensive  (  cry(  (  crycry Songs Of Time.

We dont really have anything different. Same old christmas thing every year.Yer parents probably didnt put the presents out so you wouldnt shake em. ;)I got what i wanted from my mom this year, a big stereo with 3 types of base and a remote!

Thyme felt a surge of death wave across him, his home was destroyed, and his father, was dead. "IMPOSSIBLE!" he thought, "why would the King destroy him, he never betrayed anyone." Thyme jumped from the stormy waters and flew up one of the tubes to the vortex king. "King, you have disappointed me, you betrayed my father, only because he was trying to help you!?, he was going to revive whitefin, and the atolm, to put them to your use! you have betrayed for the last time! i will stop you!" the vortex had now started attacking Thyme, he dodged one, and was swiped by one of the kings tentacles, "foul beast! prepare yourself, you will now be judged!" Thyme began to whither, and shake violently, his entire body tore itself apart, he was now in human form again, he began slashing with his sword at the vortex, killing all in the room, then he moved on to the king, he slashed and slashed, the King not looking hurt at all, if you dont see the tentacles falling off everywhere. then thyme blew apart again, he was in dolphin form again, his song pierced through the kings shell, attacking his core, the vortex king was now mortal. then thyme blew apart again, to reveal his true form, an apocalypes, he moved close to the king and sang, "you have been judged, you will not survive to see your so wanted future, thyme exploded in a ball of purple light, and it began to swirl. his very being was stretched beyond belief. then the light exploded again in white light, and imploded. as the air cleared of light, the king was still alive, and Thyme was nowhere in sight. ecco, whitefin, crestoe and the dragon all saw a white light, and thyme appeared in the center still wielding his sword, looking exhausted. ecco and his party were paralyzed, they could breathe though. "great defender, you must destroy the Vortex king, you must put an end to evil, and you must eradicate Arkonviox. do this, and your wishes will be granted." thyme spoke then his light expanded, and he disappeared, and he was never seen again.

((This is to replace OxyMorons post. That is NOT how my character acts, nor does it appear that OxyMoron had read any of my other posts before that. I would ask for the same respect that I give others by not playing their characters for them.))The dragon flapped his wings slowly, lowering himself to the water level. He looked at the little ones evenly. The loud, low voice came from his lips again, still slow and diliberate."Your offer is tempting, small one, but I would have to hear more of your predicament. My name is Myth. I was once king of the sea dragons, but age has forced me to leave leading to the others of my kin."With that, he waited and listened to what the dolphins had to offer.((The following part is in responce to Thymes post.))The flash came, and Myth instantly dove underwater. His age had not given away his sight or hearing, and so he saw the person who had appeared, and heard what he had to say. When he was gone, Myth rose from the water to show only hea head, which was still larger than Ecco."You two seem the topic of great interest this day."
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*sigh* I have to retype this vaguely from memory, sorry if its poorer than what it was before. I hope you don't mind me taking control of your char for a bit Myth :)***Whitefin squealed as the bright light flickered across the sky, causing them to freeze. Thymes voice booming across to the group, before dissapearing. Ecco shook his head and rose to the surface of the water, his head jutting out; pumping his tailflukes to stay in place. "Who or what was that?" Ecco questioned to the sky. Myth rose up beside Ecco, looking in the same direction. "I do not know littlefin, all I know is we have a quest to fulfill." "That was Thyme..." Whitefin spoke, startling the two. "Whitefin! Your alive!" Ecco squeaked happily at the sight of another friend. "Yes, I was dead... but Thyme's people became of use to me..." she paused, not wanting to continue to the fact that she felt partly responsible for the destruction of the war planet. "You where dead?" Myth turned and bent his head down, looking at Whitefin's furry face. "I don't trust..." he started, feeling uneasy after the past events. "Its alright, shes a friend" Ecco reassured Myth. Myth nodded. "We better not waste anymore time littlefins" Myth said, as he effortlessly lept from the water into the air, flapping his wings to hover delecately, before lowering his long clawed hands into the water, picking Ecco up carefully, and gripping him so he wouldn't slip from his fingers. "Yes, it is time" Whitefin nodded. "What about you littlefin, I can only carry one" Myth started. "I have my own way of things" she said, hoving out of the water like the great fins of the good future. "Alright" Ecco chirped. "Lets go!"

They stopped making the songs of time cd 6 yrs ago....that's what the music store said. I can't find the darn thing anywhere! Anyway, my favorite song is Blue Dream.

Atleast you don't have to live near a Robert Wyland work.While theres no PD images, theres plenty of non-commercial licensed images around. Try harder.

send your comic to me then i'll get it started.

Jurassic Beach; Origin Bay (Not on songs of time, but a part of the Ecco CD soundtrack), Deep Marjimba, St. Gabriels Mask, Deception, and Botswana are my favorites. I especially love Botswana.

What about passing the current of the level, and go to see the sharks closer ?  I would like that !I know a lil bug too...When you're in "Perils of the coral reef", go to the place where the turtle of the dolphin calf was attacked by sharks.Approach the blue fishes.Near a group of these fishes, there is a little "cave", with a orange-red rock on the ground.Charge near this rock.Try several times, until it causes a bug...It's terrific !

I dun see me though... but then again I dun have a sprite. 00;I'm sorry Atolm; but I don't have a sprite of you...Before the last BIG update (when we lost the forum data), there was the "Arkonviox.Comics" section, with a lot of sprites and backgrounds; but it isn't here any more.I've used my own background  and some sprites from other comics. The only sprite I've done is Kitnee's (and I've drawn a Xmas hat on Ark's head ^^).
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think the first is a little easy, so I did 2 anagrams.  This is the rule for two anagrams* Kitnee finds the first word* OxyMoron finds the second--&gt; Kitnee do an anagram first, then it's the turn of OxyIs it okay ?  :D OISBREDAFS (3 words)AQBUEAWUYTA (2 words)

Merry Xmas to you too my Nori ^^  *hugs !!!*

...I would like to know if someone can help me...I replaced a file by another file with the same name; but I realized I made a mistake, so I want to find my ancient file.Exemple: I had a jpg named "kohana.jpg", but I made a mistake and replaced it by another "kohana.jpg". How can I refind my old "kohana.jpg" ?!Can you help me there, guys ???
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Where am I? o.oNah, I'm kidding.  No big deal.  Anyway, that's pretty cool.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That is INCREDIBLE! O.OToo bad I have no idea what that Mutaclone character is really supposed to look like, so I have nothing to compare by.  But it's still really, really cool.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Okay, so it's just one image.The thing is, I thought it'd be cool to give each of my gaurdian characters a symbol.  So, I made up symbols that each stand for something specific and correspond with each ocean and its respective gaurdian.So, I drew all four gaurdians with their symbols.  Oh, and btw, it's not to scale.  In other words, Salacia and Alignnak are both much bigger compared to the other two than they should be.  They're actually quite a bit smaller than that.Hrm...here it is//www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album03&amp;id=gaurdiansymbols&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_photo.phpMechanical pencils are horrible for shading.  But I have nothing else.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Myth beat his wing lightly, rising up into the sky. There was no forward motion, or in any other direction, only up. After a moment or two, he let the wind spill from his wings and he dropped. Making sure not to drop Ecco, hew opened his wings to their full length, overshadowing Crestoe and Whitefin. His decent slowed and transfered into forward movement. He raced above the water, the sun reflecting of the waves and illuminating the underside of his body."Where are we going, little one?"The voice seemed a little louder than usual, as if he had to force his mouth and throught to work. Ecco noticed this, and Whitefin did as well as she struggled to keep up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That is indeed cool looking Eao.Excellent job. =)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh wow, those symbols are really pretty. =)and I think the shading came out good. Those type of pencils can be a pain but a blender should do a job.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
sad yet true. o_o;

The picture has been done for awhile but I guess lazyness has over took me.http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/v/a/vanessachacon/scan0025.jpg.htmlfor some reason it does not look as good on the computer as it does in real life. Bad scan perhaps. &gt;&lt;so much of the picture is cut out, the actual one is quite big.Doing a pic based on the Aztec Indians was pretty cool to me. I might do another one. Perhaps Qutzalcoyatal  (i can never spell his name!!!)but I have other art to do before that. =)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
just some quick questions.Arkon, what is the fin colors on your character? I know he is a tan dolphin but I think the fins were a different color right?Does anyone have a good pic of Crestoe? side pic preferred.Progress is going well dont know when I am going to be done, but I am going to take my time on this. =)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
dun worry Noriko, I'll draw a dolphin piccy for you too. =)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hmmm...well, to be honest, I don't have a clue.Let a lesson be learned from this! o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Alright, does anyone have the sprites that doomtr...erm, arsenal....created for us a ways back? I'd love to have em. =)

<div id='container'>
they remind me of runes and other "popilar symbols"lemme guess you had to do tis "all by your self right"a while ago i wanted a word, or phrase...translation or symbols to dissassemble and ressasemble to make"to find beauty in darkness and tragity" somthing like that.  meaning somtimes the most horrific and sorrowfull events or storys have a type of beauty that is hard to explane.I got no help...all i wanted was to turn a sentince into a word. I think i have it now "tu'berok" and the symbol is strange it's a TFBDA in one.  repeted word letters don't come up.your little sea critters look so happy

I actually made all those ymbols up on the spot.Well, actually Tethys's symbol, the Harmony one, was based more-or-less on the Sympathy crest that I made up for my old Digimon fan character.  It's supposed to be like two cycles intertwined or something...something like that...I dunno..But the others I just kinda drew without much thought...they were just what came out of my head when I was thinking of those concepts.For each one, I just thought about which concept could be well associated with each ocean.  Peace was associated with the Pacific because it means "peaceful", so that was easy.  The others I dunno how I came up with...I guess I associated them more with the gaurdians themselves than the oceans.  I don't know why the Tethys and the Atlantic is Harmony--it just seemed right.  Salacia is a more playful character so I associated her with joy.  I had a harder time with Alignak and the Arctic.  I wanted it to be something positive and all I could think of was cold.  Well, I figured anything that lives there has to be strong.  And things in cold waters tend to be big for whatever reason.  So I came up with Strength.Yeah...so that's the explanation.

oh now, lets try to have this make sence.how much of a chance, whould a petition from ecco fans have of inspiring the game makers?  In a legel sence we would normaly have no right to write to, lets say Apploosa and ask/demand "ecco 3/4" or "defender of the future 2" Just as I cannot write to Disney co with a story idea (even if it's my own).Then again stranger things have happned invovling such matters (those Star Trek novles).so sit and think, and mabye we can make things happen, Like "the correct ecco 3" or "Ed should write the story"  if not.  Lets make a geniric dolphin game togher with rpg maker, or write/design/ect a generic dolphin game, sell it and split the money using high mathimatical skills, and still demand our names on said product.so who's with me?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
In COH I tryed to stir up excitment on Animal Planet's "the future is wild" before it came out.constently being plauged by tantalizing teasers I waited and waited for the shows airing.httpNaming-...Flish?  it sounds like somthing from Super Mario Brothers.  Also they had an animal that shares its name with a neopet (i shuld make my own dolpin with a name of Ehkko..looks and sounds like ecco) Sharkopaths are the seas egg heads...and giant meat eating birds called carakillers eat monkeys.  Oh don't forget "squbbions" monkey (gibbon) like squids!Lack of other creaturs- I expected to see somthing on whales (if they we not extint) and dolphins...or mabye see "anthro crockroaches" but the sturdy bug wasn't mentioned once.  sure Jellyfish, and sea slugs...spiders even termites and squids but no roaches.  Mabye us people took them into space with the missing dolphins.I just also though this was ecco-ish, with the time travle and all, The flying dolphins and David Brin/Sega-Apploosa's Clan, outcast, circule, crimsion and movers.I have in fact an idea of a better show.what do you think life would be like if the human-monkeys died out before they started hurling rocks at animals and eating them? If we were all near species-less spirtual entities watching the evolution go about "naturaly" (conserning humans as an outside forces raised, and or created and released into the wild by Aliens)who or what would fill in the gap?  would real monkeys/apes rule? or would birds be next?  this is an open discussion. Please this is intelligent and deep, don't lock this topic of ideas, creativity and what not.

Wow cool !Is it an artists community ? If it is, I think I'll probably join it too  :DYeah, it's free.  I like it cuz I can do more than just post art.  I can even post photos, if I had any...I'm not a photogropher but if I was that would be really good, cuz Side 7 won't allow photos unless they're manipulated.  And, from what I can tell, it appears I can also post poetry.  Which I'll have to do sometime, since I do have a few poems.Wow, I had no idea anyone from here was on DA.  Of course, I never heard even about it until like last month or something.  And some of my favorite TA artists are there, too.The only downside is that I can't use puncuation in titles.  Which means trying to refrain from things that would require commas or quotes.  Oh well.  It's really cool, I already like it quite a bit.

Sorry it is taking longer then expected. I got some cool art shit for xmas, and I have been fucking around with it all. New pens, paper, what have you. So I am trying to find a good, permanent format for the frames that will allow me to have more room in the comic, and Im looking for easier ways to draw the comics and whatnot. The roughs are done, but I need to screw around with some shit before I get the final versions up. But I am not slacking off, I can assure you. They might come out looking the same when you see them, but I might have found some new, better techniques. Just thought I should post it here since I have been spending less and less time in the chatroom.

This is the first chapter of the new fanfic I am writing. I'm tossing it up here to prove that, in fact, I am still alive and doing stuff of no consequence. Format's kind of screwy, but it's still legible. So look at it, read it if you must, and leave an opinion. If you do not like it and don't leave a reason, I shall be forced to ignore your comment. Which you'll never know about anyway.Two Cities of the Sea~~~~1~~~~	Ketrul looked across the waves from the bow of his ship. The sky wasclear and the sea was calm. There would be smooth sailing on his journey. Helooked up at the great sails that would sent his ship on its way. The sails wereobsolete compared to the abilities of his people, but they were a necessarydisguise in case they encountered a ship from the mainland. His people did notwant to be noticed by the humans, even if they did owe part of their heritage tothem.	At the slightest glance the ship could be distinguished from a mainlandvessel. Ketrul's ship, like most others from his native Teranias, was white. Itwas a striking contrast to the usual brown wooden hulls used by Mainlanders.There wasn't much white hull to see in any case. The ship floated low in thewater. The aft deck was nearly level with the surface. The large sails used bythe ship, though not necessary, could alone propel the ship to match the paceof the fastest ships used by the Mainlanders.	Atop the sails waved the banner of his people. A blue circle for themother ocean, watched over by the daystar. The daystar promised to alwaysreturn to guide and protect after the darkest night or harshest storm. Ketrul feltreassured that this symbol alone would give his ship the respect it deserved,warning any mainland ships to keep their distance. 	Ketrul looked down. Dolphins were already gathering around the ship'sprow. He wished he could dive in with them, but his mission dictatedotherwise.	His people had been weary of those of Atlantis, and the feeling wasmutual. The two cities were nearly equals, and far superior to those of themainland. All mainland vessels yielded to ships from the two cities, whoyielded only to each other.	The first olive branch had been extended a few years ago. It was anattempt endorsed only by Councilor Kinsus. It had been a surprise to the wholecouncil when the Atlanteans returned the offer. The resulting trade agreementbetween Atlantis and Teranias had greatly benefited both cities.	Ketrul's mission was to propose a new endeavor to Atlantis. An "Allianceof Knowledge" it had been termed. It was hoped that the resulting cooperationwould open new frontiers in the sea, and maybe someday lead to the stars.	Ketrul noticed an Atlantean ship docking across the harbor. Its crewalready preparing to unload cargo and possibly stay for shore leave. Ketruldecided his crew had better get ready for their own voyage.~~~	Bavos swam down the canal. He was a large dolphin, and the respect hehad won from his pod was the reason why he was chosen to represent his kindin the council of Teranias. His powerful flukes sent him on his way quickly andwith a feeling of importance. His aide, a much smaller dolphin, struggled tokeep up.	"Why are we in such a hurry to reach the Tower?" asked the aide,respectfully.	"Kinsus has requested that we council at noon." Bavos called back.	Slightly puzzled, the smaller dolphin swam close to the water's surfaceand cast his eyes toward the sky.	"The daystar can not yet be seen above the Tower's gate, why are we insuch a hurry?"	Bavos let out a quick laugh.	"The meeting's time does not matter. We race to beat the Orca councilor.You watch for her. I believe she lives in that tower just waiting for council to becalled. She even beat Kinsus to his own Atlantis proposal."	Bavos had not taken kindly to Kinsus' optimism toward the Atlanteans,and had only reluctantly accepted the series of alliances he had planned.	"Has he yet explained his reasoning for calling council?" Questioned theaid.	"No, Balae," Responded Bavos, "But I'd wager it has to do with thisAtlantis business."~~~	Tega stepped forward to meet the captain of the Atlantean ship. He wasthe aide to Kinsus, who had asked him to escort the captain personally.	"Taj et vey tu." He greeted her.	The Atlantean cocked her head slightly as a look of concentrationcrossed her face. Then she smiled.	"If I understand correctly, 'Pleasure and good day?'"	"I'm impressed." Replied Tega. "I do not know many Atlanteans whohave bothered to learn our language."	He walked away from the dock as the Atlantean walked beside him.	"We don't have the... skill as you Teranians have at cracking languagebarriers, but I took it upon myself to learn yours." 	"It is a trick of the mind. We hear and understand. We speak and areunderstood. A gift from the Ancients." Said Tega, referring to the gods ofTeranias. He couldn't help but notice the skeptical look cross the captain's face.	"I'm sorry, I don't believe I caught your name." Tega added, politely.	"Oh, I should have introduced myself," Said the Atlantean, "I am Lera,Captain and now envoy to Teranias."	A smile crept over Tega's face.	"May your new title serve you well."~~~	"Who's that, father?" Asked a young child, pointing up at a large statue ofa women dressed in a long, flowing gown. 	Kinsus looked up at the figure his son was pointing at. 	"That, Ralu, is Ika Arelia. She rules the night and oversees all the stars,planets, moons, everything beyond the sky."	Kinsus had chosen today to bring Ralu to the Museum of the Ancients inthe center of Teranias, to gain a greater appreciation for the gods.	"How many stars are up there?" Ralu asked innocently.	"Far too many," Replied Kinsus, "Only Arelia knows, for only she hasenough time to count them."	Seemingly satisfied, Ralu ran into the next room where an equally grandlikeness of another of the Ancients resided. Kinsus followed as memories of hisown childhood welcomed him back to the room.	Ralu stood at the far end, looking confused at the statue that dominatedthe center of the chamber.	"Father," He began, "This one isn't like the others."	Kinsus looked up at the statue, feigning a look of surprise.	"What?" He asked, then looked back at Ralu.	"What makes it different?"	Ralu looked at his father with disbelief. He knew his father was a smartman, why could he not see the difference?	"It doesn't look like us. It's a dolphin."	Kinsus looked back at the statue. Then again at Ralu.	"Why does that matter?" He asked. He wanted to judge his son's reaction.	Ralu thought it over. Well, he thought, Dolphin's look different. That's so they can live in the water. They are smart, but can't build things since they don'thave hands. An Ancient wouldn't need hands, would it? Why would an Ancientlook like a dolphin? Then a larger thought came to mind. Why would an Ancientlook like a Teranian? Ralu couldn't find a good reason.	"Does it matter?" He asked. Kinsus smiled.	"No. This is Ika Setra. She oversees the ocean, and guides those who tryto sail it. She can be as calm as ice or as angry as a tempest. She is just the sameas the others, and if she lives in the sea, why shouldn't she choose to look likeone of its residents?"	Ralu found justification in the answer, and studied Setra's likeness witha new found respect. Kinsus couldn't help but do the same. All Teraniansshowed reverence toward to sea, and Kinsus made a point to respect everythingit included. He didn't notice Tega walk up behind him until he heard hisbreath.	"Excuse me, Sir," Tega began, "But the Atlantean ship has docked and itscaptain is awaiting you and Bavos in the Tower."	Kinsus nodded.	"Yes, thank you, could you watch over Ralu for me? I hope for this to bequick."	Tega looked over at Ralu, then smiled at Kinsus.	"Revisiting your childhood I see."	Kinsus returned the smile.	"Maybe he will enjoy it as much as I do."	Tega began to follow Ralu, who was slowly entering the next chamber.	"I'll see to it." He called back.	As he walked back to the museum's entrance, Kinsus had to laugh at thesound of Ralu's voice drifting back from the next camber.	"What is this one!"	"That," came the sound of Tega's voice now, "Is what the Mainlanderswould call a 'dragon.' To us, it is Tyras, Ika of Fire."	Kinsus wished he could see the look on Ralu's face now.~~~	"What do you mean 'It's not here?'" Ketrul asked his crew mate.	"I mean what I said," the sailor replied, "The navigation electronics saythis is where Atlantis is, but there is no evidence we can see of there ever beinga city here." 	Ketrul frowned. 	"Are you sure it is working? Electronics have been known to lie."	"Not likely, electronics don't make such mistakes any more. We'vebecome much better over the years at building and teaching them."	Ketrul didn't like placing his trust in an electronic. He walked out on tothe deck of his ship, its false sails billowing in the fresh breeze. It certainlydidn't look like the great city of Atlantis should be there.	He went to the edge of the deck and gave a long high-pitched whistleover the side. Shortly after, the head of a blue dolphin rose above the water.Teranian dolphins were known for their odd and seemingly random skincoloration. Ketrul was grateful he was Teranian or else he would need anotherelectronic to talk to the dolphin.	"Artreus," He called down. "Can you see anything that looks like it wasfrom Atlantis from down below?"	The dolphin sank into the water, then rose almost clear of it by strongsweeps of its tail. He could almost look over the low deck of the ship.	"I have seen nothing from bellow but the ocean's floor." Came thedolphin's response.	Ketrul frowned.	"Take Surina and go back down. Make a thorough search. If you suspectanything down there can be linked to Atlantis, come back and tell meimmediately."	At this comment, another head rose from the water, this one pale gray."We will look hard," Said Surina, "Nothing of Atlantis can hid from out sight orsound." The two dolphins sank back into the water, hardly making a splash.	Ketrul headed back for his cabin and pulled out a small box from underhis bed.	"What's that for?" Asked the sailor, who stood anxiously by his captain'sside.	"This," said Ketrul, holding up a sextant and compass, "Is my shield froma broken electronic."

I was sitting here thinking just now...what if there was a thread where we artists could post art trade requests? So I made this thead! I'll explain how it works, with rules and all, then I'll give an example.How It Works1) If you ask to do a trade with a specific artist, that person has the right to reject the request.2) When leaving a trade out on the floor, so to speak, it's first come, first serve. For example, if I started a public trade, the first person to reply to my request is the person I will do the trade with; any posts after that will be ignored.3) When replying to a trade, make sure you quote that person's post by using the "Quote" option on the forum; for those of you who don't know (but really, who wouldn't around here?), the "Quote" option is that little button in the corner of every post - it looks like quotation marks.Example TradeType of Trade humanResources for Piece (these can either be text links or pictures posted using the image tags)//sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/junsui.pngNow let's say that someone accepted my trade. When they reply, in their message they should include my original post, plus their picture info.That's all there is to it! ^_^ Let's get trading! I'll start by posting my first trade request, which just happens to be the example trade. &gt;;p~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Type of Trade humanResources for Piece//sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/junsui.png

I don't understand what a trade is...Sorry, Kitnee, but it's true... :?

httpshock: Are they 2 females ?!?!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heh - no, Sten. ^^; The one on the left is my best friend (who is a girl), and the one on the right is one of my Phantasy Star Online characters that she finds particularly handsome. So I drew the two of them kissing. &gt;^^&lt;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah, that's my fault - didn't explain what a trade actually was. ^^;;;;  An art trade is a trade of pictures between two people. Like, one person draws a picture for someone, and in return the other person draws a picture for the first person. Was that helpful?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That means adding some flash to the site or play with animated gifs. Both of the ways mean animation work, and that's hard to do.By the way, probably I'm wrong, but that necklace in your avatar reminds me that game... "fate of atlantis".
</div>
<br />

Okay Tethys! If you want to do one with me that is fine by me. ^_^Type of trade Human, sea creature. something.I have seen your Anthro work on DA. Can you do one of my character? =D

Ah the Asterite, so mysterious.I know him as a huge DNA stran that has much knowledge of the planet. If he was from another world, he musta liked earth well enough to evolve into that silver like form in ToT.

a skin with flash in it. that could be cool. i'll consider it.

what kind of things can you do In France when you are 15? or do you have to wait?example in America you must be at least 16 to smoke(i think) and 21 to drink and 17 or somthing to be a "reasonable driver" and at 18 you are an "adult"(This is an edit by PhosisD
</div>
<br />

So you mean a rip off of planet of the apes then? What if the planet was ruled by super intelligent power roaches? They are the most resiliant race on the planet, and can survive an atomic blast. Yeah.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You cant, eao. And why the fuck would you want to? It isnt an ecco to me. It is a greyscale dolphin on a screen, in a crappy "action" game, with horrible music. I own the thing and It makes me want to die when I play it.

I have Ecco 1, 2 and DOTF.

That was a strange show to watch. The silver spiders were pretty though.I really dhoubt that the producers had flying dolphins in mind when they were creating the show.Insects still rule the planet long after us mammals kick the buket. I really doubt there will be such a thing as anthro cockroaches, a human sized one will be crushed with the earth's gravity and then there is the complecation with their circulatory system. I had a bio class that ecplained why insects are so frggin small.It truly makes me wonder how much longer some species has before going extinct.... just gotta rely on good ol evolution to take its corse.

I have been having a dilemna lately. It concerns my comic, channel darkseas. My scanner, in short, is hooped. Shanked. dead. fucked. gone. I dont know what the hell happened when I was away, but its okay...I am getting it fixed soon enough, and can use my other one for minor things. I have been designing a new style...a new WAY for my comic. It will have the same characters, etc. But I need to think of a new layout, and an easier way to make it. A template of some kind. The fact is, I simply don't like how it looks. I always wanted it to have a certain level of...UN-professionalism. But that Idea just never worked, as the comics have good looking parts, and bad looking parts. In short, it makes them look stupid.I have been reading comics lately on the web, whos main feature is that they look bad, and can make fun of themselves because of it. This also makes it much easier for the authors of the comics to make them on a daily basis, giving you a wide range of comics to select from whenever you go to the site. I like that idea. And instead of copying it, I am going to make my own way that uses the same idea.Expect comics soon. Just not as soon as you hoped to see them
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh yea...hm, good question. ...Kit?Okay Atolm! ^_^ I think I know where to find a pic of your Atolm beast...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I didn't watch it. I was going to, but I didn't. All I know is this: After the nuclear holocaust, there will be cockroaches and Cher.I forget where I heard that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hahahaha. Cher. She'll live forever and theres nothing we can do about it. ._.How old is she, a billion? Anyways, yeah, i was going to watch that too but i fell asleep cuz of my lack of getting sleep from working on backgrounds for grand theft yogoat. Im sure it was still pretty good aside from some of those things.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Haha, yea. Like a billion.  She's freaking immortal, I swear to god.It looked pretty interesting, though. I mean, now I kinda wish that I watched it, what with all the talk of silver spiders and squbbions and flish and whatnot. Heh.  ANYWAYS, monkeys are ugly.  o_o But besides that, Maybe birds would rule, like Eao said. Not roaches. I think it would be dolphins. Or maybe something we would've least expected...like maybe if humans hadn't come around, what if it was like...I don't know, starfish. They could've grown to be these huge ole' intelligent beings and built spaceships and stuff. o__o...*cough*
</div>
<br />

hmmmmm know what sucks more?  my idea of an inteelegent talk of "what would evolution be like without the human interferance"?6 *&amp;(P&amp;ing reads and no replys at the offical forum.shitcrap(more swears) I can't go anywhere without being ignored or insulted.i feel like robbing a chruch

geezh I diddn't want to insult you Phosis.I just suppose I'll get unbanned somhow from COH and suggest to them to have the only ecco site with the blemished dolphin namesake.why can't you 'emulate' it? how did them emulate all other games?i'll beat you with pong

Its different...its one of those crappy games that uses that liquid crystal display. It just is hard, and I wasnt pissed off, I just pray to god you dont destroy your own brain by playing that atrocity.

No one is insulting you directly. Its just that sarcastic sense of humour. But half of what i said was serious, about the roaches. That could happen. I also support your idea for robbing a church.

Your hard headed. It is nothing like ecco. Think of it as a really really really boring platformer. You can only move up, or down, and the only thing you can do is avoid objects. The game is SO easy you can beat it in 10 minutes. You dont want to play this game. For the love of god, nobody will ever want to emulate it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well not quite as bad as pokey. I want to have the characters look good, and the backgrounds look bad, or the other way around. something stylish, yet not.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah Eao. I am gong to lock this godamn topic because you contradict yourself too damn much. *locks*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You dont have to make it like other comics. Make it what you want. Just stop apologizing about your taking long to get it up. o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
And for the record, Pokey the penguin was GENIUS. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
We get the point. If i hear any more about it, i'll rob a church.And im only saying that cuz eao did. o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
atualy phosis it would be possible to emulate. but as you said why do it? no one gives a shit about them lame assed pocket arcades.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
anyways to get back on the subject while we still have an audiance i plan to get the sprites up eventualy. right now i got alot of restoration to do. the first project im currently doing is the blundercaves.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
apaloosa isnt working on anything else and ecco seems to be there mascot of sorts. give them time. and if not hopefully we can pray i'll make my game.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Exactly. Eao if you are so stupid that you still want to play them, you will have to find them on EBay or emulate them yourself. Case closed. I am not going to lock this topic, as I have been on a locking-spree lately. I will end on an on topic note, saying, I have played EVERY ecco, including the pocket one, EXCEPT for Ecco Junior PICO.I just plum forgot about that one.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yeah phosis your comic rocks because the art sucks. plus the humors great. quit trying to work so hard and take it easy. you got good material.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*sighs* yet another section i got to get back up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ed wont make one. He is tired of ecco, and hates us all....Well, maybe not, but he is through with ecco, at least for awhile.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Which is why Im doing this. So it will be easier for me to do, and so I will be more reliable to do it. As you know, I put this shit off a lot. Not because I dont like doing it, but because the "system" I have devised to do it is a crude one. This will make it easier, and better looking all at once.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The character Phosis, who is barely a developed character other then my own Non-ecco-related story, has been emulated by many things. He is in a poorly drawn comic, and....well i wont spoil the next thing until it is out. and it is not by me this time. But It will be funny as hell.Point is, I dont want Phosis in another comic, even if you didn't intend on putting him there. Now you can REALLY not intend on it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have been writing just such a story for about a year now. But it does not have orcas as a punishment. I was going to add them seomewhere, but not like that. I figured they would be another enemy of the dolphins. A sly enemy like the Fox. Tricking dolphins into being friendly with them, then chowing down.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
like you ever beat me at metroid online.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
shuuuttuuup....o_o;Can anyone give me directions to a good sprite editing program? or a ripping program of some kind?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I dunno about a ripper - I just usually take screenshots and rip them by hand. What I do is disable the palette layers that comprise the background so it's easier for me to rip the sprite.As for the editor, just plain old MSPaint works. Or you could use PainShopPro or Photoshop if you have them.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thats sweet Kit. Yours is almost ready to scan, just gotta get off my ass and colour it with prissies ^^; gotta-work-harder-and-not-play-ff8... Laguuuuuuunnnaaaa *dribbles* Ok, ok, I'm ok ;D *breaks out her prissies* Whacha! ^______^

<div id='container'>
No! *tries to grab Mr. Artreus before he hides in the void again...is unsuccessful, most likely* x_o damn.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Here's my thinking; if someone is swimming with a dolphin, they need to carefully watch how they act. Like their body movements. It wouldn't be good to accidentally 'start something' and not be able to finish it, especially sexually.(x_x) Sometimes people are just ignorant or misinformed and don't know to do and what not to do. Or maybe the person like...accidentally touched the dolphin somewhere and pissed it off. lol. Or they could just be jerky dolphins. That's probably a better explanation, too.  Okay, now please excuse me as I go finish my world history project. I think I'm starting to babble. x_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You can stick me in if ya want, Eao. I'll take up Van's part or somethin'.

Well, that's up to you guys! But just remember shipping charges and stuff. o_OOh, and Cally, your pic is done, I just need to scan and CG it.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Your point is seen. But Alastor needs a thrashing now and then anyways.Speaking of sprites, did anyone get that Ecco rpg to work? If you want a fanmade ecco game to be made, Eao, you should rip the stuff from that. The sprites were good apparently.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Disney ???I think it's better to not write them about Ecco; they would make a film with mouth-talking dolphins, and as usual, the old idea of "all the dolphins are nice; all the orcas are cruel dolphin killers"...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
or you van make it like "red meat"in this comic (pannle comic) the characters pictures are basicly the same....nearly always (mabye with a .1% differance time to time)if you make it like this (pretend you use clip art) you'll never need new images.in one of these comics, a man is telling 'us' how his hampster hads babies and ate some.he give his never changing bug eyed creepy look ands says "heck i had a few myself"oddd huh?

<br />
<div id='container'>
ok.....Kitty Wittty? how bouy that for a nameand the Lawyer Ali-Waly is important! (Arkon i never finished it, also there are some pages missing, sequential art isn't very sequential if it's missing pages)

<div id='container'>
Well...Like humans...some dolphins are just jerks.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
This reminds me of that old "nympho dolphins" topic in the old forum. o_o But Pho's right - dolphins are like people in that some of them are assholes.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Happy Birthday Sten :D *Runs back and hides in the void*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Orcas DO kill dolphins, but I see nothing cruel about it. Against a meat-eater that big I doubt the dolphins feel much pain.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
and yours are simply RIPE with points?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Besides, it's just the way nature works. Although, since orcas are just really big dolphins anyway, I guess you could call them cannibals? O_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah. Here's a point for you.Shut the fuck up.Nah im just kidding. If it wasn't for you, I would have no one to play metroid online with, except Silverfin. and THATS no fun, because I cant beat him.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hm....I guess somehow Atlom will replace Tidesinger.somhow, I guess Alastor the lawer gets him into trouble for false psysic readings.so Kitnee do you want to be dressed up as a fox/cat-fox?  Like Tethies is a duck?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
"if you can't keep up with the joneses just eat them"hmmm...oh if anyone would want to write a dolphin socity story..the dolphins could use a local tribe of orca as a excicution system.i hope ecco..4 is good or made.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Practice what you preach about topics, Pho. ;)As for the sprites, I know that Stenellya made one of me for her Christmas comic, Al.
</div>

Yeah!! That would be cool!! ^^

hm....I guess somehow Atlom will replace Tidesinger.A person is irreplaceable, Eao.

i think they were adapted from Game gear, besides with rpg maker i made...'funny' dolphins.  the look like the're 'tail walking' on land.but the shading is awfull.  PNG.....go figure.but sence I'd exiled from COH if i rally you guys up -we- make a game.not -them- *nods*hmmm anone make a sprite from true scratch?  I tryed, but i only got the head's vaules right.or just take DOTF screen shots and trace over them in photoshop.I made an Arky, Me and Alastor.

either the disable the background layers in the emulator (if possible) and take a screen shot, or just take the screenshot and sort out the sprite from the background...sadly, its not so easy in ecco at times because its crackpot designers made ecco share alot of colors with his backdrops, and it can be difficult to figure out exactly where ecco ends and the water begins. ._.;As for editing....MSPaint for cutting out and Photoshop for coloring. o_o;

If I recall tidey whitey or whatever was actually whitefin...before whitefin went away and we got callyfin instead. =)

Recently, one of my friends, and ex-manager at A&amp;W (Arsenal and Delphi might have heard about this on the news...) was killed in a car accident. None of you probably knew him...so it might not matter to you. But the internet, and this webpage, has served as an outlet of my thoughts, and It is one of the only ways to show my respect.So I present to you a tiny article about him, and why he will be missed.Clayton was his name. The dude in glasses and an A&amp;W tie that served all of those vicious, life sucking customers food every night, all night. He had to deal with some rough stuff. drunks, morons, people who dont like their meat "Raw". But he was always a great guy about it. Every day, he would go to sleep, as he worked night shifts. He would come in, and rant about video games for a few hours before he worked, and we would discuss all the tiny details of our meager lives. Mostly concerning Gamecube. I didn't spend a lot of time outside of work with the guy. We just made fun of people, drank pop, and talked about what level we were on in Timesplitters. He was 20, was a manager, had a girlfriend, and a good circle of friends...He also came from a family of 8 brothers and sisters, and everyone knew him around the area. Boxing day night, he was with his friend Will. It was Wills birthday, and they had just got off work. Popping a new cd into the player, they drove down the highway, having a good time. Clayton went to change cd's, and turned a corner. Instead of braking to slow down, he hit the accelerator by accident, and slammed into a pole. The pole fell, straight through the middle of the car, splitting the vehicle in half. Clayton was thrown out. The impact caused his seat belt to snap. He hit the pavement, and died instantly. Quick, and we hope, painless. His family is devestated. His brother and sister, age 15 and 18, go to the same school as me, and are in ruin. So, I finish this article. He was a great guy, and was only 20. He didn't deserve what happened. But it did, and there is nothing we can do.so buddy, I just hope your in a better place, playing better games, on better systems, with better women. You will be missed greatly by lots of us, and I just hope it is better up there then it is down here.Rest in peace. I'll go kill a Time Splitter for ya..- Joel "Phosis" Peterson

well that sucks phosis. having watched about a dozen back to the futures recently i was about to rant about an inane idea of going back in time and preventing it from happening. too bad marty destroyed the time machine in back to the future . ._.anyways im sorry that happened to your friend. kinda a sad story cause he seemed to have a life ahead of him and didnt get a chance. the way i see it those who die dont usesually die. for those who been around them useually take a trait from them. for all the people i known i have taken on many of there traits.

No worries. Like arkon said, He's still alive somewhat. His soul is probably hopping around somewhere, criticizing people that they suck at games and stuff right now. I will be back more now, and do more work, I just wanted to take a couple days of thought to myself. First time someone Ive known like that has died. and besides, Arkon. You know my time machine failed. Probably because all the materials I used had something to do with food.anyways, I am going to visit his grave this weekend. Its a tragic thing, but it is all part of the wheel of life, and nature, and what not. Its going to happen to me someday, and all of us. It was just a shame it had to happen to someone so young.*locked*

This was the first website I came to when I got the internet back. I havent been here for a year yet, but I am enjoying my stay. =)

I always liked the low-buget look of your comics, Pho. It gives it chacter I think. But I just like the soud of having the characters look good and the background looking bad for some reason. I think that would give it an awesome level of style. Anyways... I look forward to these comics! Just fuck it and do it, I say.Good luck with it!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I know this topic is a little old, but I never got a chance to reply...I have to say, the coloring it wicked! Pencil crayon, right? It looks really nice, and I think it's just a cool picture all in all! I just love the spots, and desings on the feathers. Spiffy stuff, indeed!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Woof, this topic died out fact! I'll get to that story soon, Pho! Count on it!Anyways Ark, CAD turned into Half Past Empty. It's all new now since CAD sucked. //artdirect.dolphinparadise.net/hpe_index.htmlQuick guys! What does the title mean to you?!?!

Yes it was sooo fun! In Shamu close up, Sumar came right up to the glass and was "talking" to me! I saw Cometta. I like Beaker too. Corky is my favorite whale. Bjossa used to be.I can see someone jumping in there. It'd be awsome! :)

I stuck up a few comics about a month ago and I'm thinking about maybe doing some more. I have ideas for a few, but if anyone wants to see one for a specific level I'll see if I can come up with something.Here's a link to my album because I know I rarely want to find something on my own, so this is for everyone else like me.http://www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album32&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.php

oh please don't start that aweful game again ._.;
</div>
<br />

Its good, very good indeed although the image quality could be better. Never be afraid to bump it to 8, thats what i usually do for my pics.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Damn, I still have not gone to seaworld..... I really need to one day. Anyways I am glad that you were able to enjoy it. =)

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Cool !Who's this guy exactly ?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, you're right Crest, the image quality is fairly poor. I think I saved it at 7, but I can't remember.And Sten... it's just some guy I made up. I just call him "loser". ^_-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 It will be cool to have you around again...this board begs for people in its current status.You're right there, Pho. Is it just me, or has this forum been kinda....dead as of late? o_O;;

<br />
<div id='container'>
^^ OK, Cally - take your time, and I'm glad you liked yours!
</div>

Medusa was my genius inspiration. I guess I should get another few done then. I envision more work for the screen shot editing department. :)

Happy Birthday, Lizza. Yeah, a trip like that is on the to do list somewhere. Actually, my last birthday was in Florida and I got to see a couple of wild dolphins. I'd like to get just a little closer though.

<div id='container'>
yeah, arkon generally limits his posts to alastor-insults and welcomes. o_o

<div id='container'>
&lt;yogoat&gt; Quotes are coo'. o.o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
no this forum has been dead. i blame myself cause i got to rebuild the whole site. theres no content so people who are new don't relly care about the site as much.suprisingly i been working on the site every day. im building a new fanfare where people can create there own profiles and change them without me having to do it. if im lucky i may have it done withen the next two days.i been taking my time on the work since i got to face the facts. theres too much work for me to do. and its better i not rush perfection. eventualy my site will be back and better then ever.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, that's really cool how you put the 3D stuff together like that, and it looks flawless even!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sweetness! o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Great pictures, guys!Hm, I think I'll try this.  Especially since I need a picture to work on.  So this would be good.Type of Trade choice between furry or....sea...creature...x.x;Okay, actually I have no preference for which of my characters anyone draws.  I almost never do.  Although it'd be great if someone could do one of my Ocean Guardians.  Even tho I myself have been neglecting them...x.x  Or else someone could just do one of my furry charas.  All the pictures that I have of my Guardian characters can be found on my gallery at this site//www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album03&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.phpAs for my furry charas, right now the best place to go for reference pics is my archive at Side 7//www.side7.com/cgi-bin/S7SDB/Archive.pl?ANO=1610Cuz I lost a ton of images on Artail...;_;  And my DA gallery doesn't have much as of yet.For my furry characters, I reccomend you look for my character sheets--or if you just tell me which one you wanna do, I can send a link to the respective character sheet..Yeah...so...if anyone wants to trade with me, you have a lot to choose from.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*nods* Of course, Arkon! Just pace yourself, take your time, and don't rush. We'll all be patient.  :D As for the newbies....well, they're just gonna have to learn to be patient and deal with it. o_O;

yeah, i thought i should be the one who should say somethingcallyfin lives in australia as you all know. down in aussiland theyve been having serious droughts, causing brush fires. the fires have reached too close to cally's house, and her area is on standby of evacuation. her town has announced a state of emergency. she and her family have packed up all thier stuff, being prepared to leave if the fires reach too close. of course shes safe, the area will be evacuated with enough time so everyone will have time to get out...but she wont be online for awhile...thats why you havent/wont see her for a bit. she wrote an entry explaining it in her livejournal //www.livejournal.com/~callyfinplease pray that the fires will stay away from her house. i cant imagine how scary it would be to pack all your life into a car, and only hoping that the fire wont destroy your house aswell.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's terrible...Of course I will,Trell.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thanx lizcally updated her journal, still on standby, but the fires have stayed away so far. hopefully that will continue.

I built a new fanfare but dont expect the section to look as it does now. I plan to improve it and so far its in its beta stage which means there might be some problems with it lurking that i may have not noticed. But i want everyone to start filling out profiles and get in on this.http://arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Chronus&amp;file=index&amp;func=cpm_indexThis took me probably about a week to build considering i had to work all week which fucked up things for me. It still needs alot of work but its good enough for use.Let me know if your expierencing any problems with it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i didnt even hear anything about wild fires in austrialia thats too bad. hopefully her house doesn't burn down or any other houses.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I should have bothered to check that out as well. When there is a Phosis reference involved, I usually immediately check the topic. But Im sure Arkon fixed that problem the moment he heard about it...or, at least sometime that night.

I only just got my computer back on in my room at the moment. Thank you so much for letting them know Trellia *hugs*. Currently we are again still on standby for the next three days, as high winds and scorching temps are a threat to the backburning they're attempting. I can tell you exactly how close the fires got to my house. We live in Conder, a southern sub-urban area. We are next to an area called banks, and about 10 mins walk away is Gordon. Te fires that broke out on the hill in Gordon spread right through it, and got as far as the shops there. That was freaky to know. What was freakier was that at 3pm the smoke went black and the sky was as dark as night, with red glows surrounding our area. It was so dark that it looked like it was 10 pm because the street lights came on. I think the current stats areFour people are dead,30 are injured - 2 are critically injured (have been flown to Sydney),368 houses have been lost (over a hundred of those are in Duffy and Chapman alone),Main Servaces have been put under preasure due to some of the sub-plants being burnt down; (Water, Gas, Electricity and Sewrage),The Sewrage Treatment plant is threatening to overflow and contaminate the Molonglo river, which is our water supply,All suburbs that where/are under threat are to remain on high alert as fires could break out again. I still have all my stuff packed in my suitcase and travel bag - we're readyto just load it into the car and run if we need to. Because what my dad said is that if we have to evacuate, and it comes over any of the ridges near us, we have about 10-15 mins to get out before it jumps the main road out. Meh... I hate fire.. but yes, i'm still alive, we still have a house, and even if we loose the house if fire gets near us, we've got photos of all our belongings and an inventory so we can re-insure all we own beforehand. Hehe. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I heard about that too, :(........ ack...  Through "Teletext". Really worrying
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I never thought I'd be doing this, but here I am... Back... Again... Many things have changed since the time I left. I'm sorry if I kind of dumped any of you, I don't really remember. Those of you who remember me, well, it's nice that you are still around.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, I think I do remember you. :) Nice to see you back. Stick around and enjoy yourself.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hate to say this, but I think I've found one of your lurking bugs. Having just set up a profile for myself, I looked at a few of the others, and they all had my avatar.  :? Maybe it was just because I was looking at them, ie for Phosis everyone would have his avatar. So, yeah. Testing out the fanfare.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What game is that from anyway, Arkon. o_O
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You have a lot of cool-ass time on your hands. That is some interesting stuff.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It was an online store, actually. American Crafts Online, I think.

<br />
<div id='container'>
*hugs Cally tightly* Oh, Cally...I am so sorry to hear this!   I'm so glad you and your family are safe...be careful, and I'm praying for you guys over there.

No, not the website. I was borred, and not much happens around here very often, so I went looking for various Ecco/sea related stuff. I couldn't find a good picture of Cetus.Here's the most obvious//www.scienceandart.com/photodelphinus.jpgDelphineus, the dolphin.http//www.slivoski.com/astronomy/images/cetus.jpgNo outline. http//www.scienceandart.com/photofrosecapricorn.jpgCapricorn, the Sea goat and sign of the zodiac, tossed in for good measure.Couldn't find a mask for St. Gabriel.

thanks i would have never found that problem myself. can't belive i made that mistake. heh.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yo
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
welcome back ankou. i thought i wouldnt see you ever again. especialy since this place has been trying to die on me and so forth.everytime an old eprson comes back im forced to reflect on a past that never was ;_;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
back to the future for the nes. the most crappiest game of all tiems o_o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm well this place looks pretty much alive to me hehe... Fast replies... *honks*   I won't let you die mwahaha... No matter how hard you try!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hi! er..... never seen you here before but um.... welcome back. =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That is such a disturbing cat, but the picture is cool.Oh yeah, I am able to do another trade. Any takers?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It is strange that my Newspaper doesnt mention it, I was looking for any articales but didnt come accross any thing.Perhaps I should look somewhere else.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I really like the Saint Gabriel one. What site you found it on?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah... Tough I've never seen you before, it's nice to meet you anyway :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, this topic might seem to be useless for some of you, but I want to ask if anybody knows... Who or what exactly is Asterite? Where he came from? And what is his mission on Earth? Could somebody who knows tell me please?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I don't think I've ever met you before, either, but welcome back anyway! Nice to see more oldbies coming back. :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
To tell the truth, I don't think anybody really knows. All we know is that there was an evil Asterite in the past. Now whether this is the Asterite Ecco knows or just a twin brother or something (I prefer the latter in my stories) is a mystery. It's not really clear what the Asterite's purpose is, other than to aid Ecco on his quest to defeat the Vortex. I like to think of the Asterite as the all-powerful, all-knowing being of the seas that can grant anything to a sea creature; but then again, that's just my stories talking.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think, At, that Tehys is waiting for someone to take her up on her trade.As for me, no trades as of yet, but I just wanted to say that I'm really glad this thread's taken off so nicely, and so fast, too!Oh, and Cally if you read this, because of your current situation, I don't even mind if you can't get my picture to me at all; that's the last thing you should worry about right now. *hugs*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm not sure about there being an evil asterite of the past, because when Ecco first encounters it, it says "I remember you," or something to the effect. But I guess any details are the responsibility of someone who really wants to work it out.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
its possible phosis.ankou was around in our dark ages. right after i took over the undercaves.let me trie to make some sort of time line.1. there was the begining era.2. the new arkonviox.com era.3. the enigma era.4. the dark era.5. the defender of the future era.6. and our new post nuke era.ankou came around during the enigma era. right during the time whent he undercaves was still around. and left in the dark era.most of you guys came during the defender of the future era. which you probably came when i summoned you guys for an art contest. sad to say that art contest never went through due to all the difficultiies this sites been though.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the asterite is one of the oldest life forms on earth. probably alien in orgin from a greater force. the ecco comics describe it as a traveler from another planet who if i remember right obsorbs information from every planet it encounters. the atserite was damaged though when it come to earth and was stuck. then ecco came and saved it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
artreus just a correction but the stars of ecco website never existed. that was just a fake ass rumor.the undercaves was the first true ecco website.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
a little ff subject i added peopels art galleries in as well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanx for clearing that up Ark.Hey Ankou, ofcourse I remember you. How could i forget. )
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well I finally got around to reading your story there Pho, and I have to say I wish I would have read it sooner!! Did you really write that?! I think it's awesome!!! Seriously... the names, and style, and just the way your write is brilliant! I don't know what to say man, I didn't know you could write so well.First off... I really liked the five elements you chose: Fire, Water, Earth, Wood, And Metal. It's usually just fire, wind water and earth, but you really mixed it up there. I love the idea of the Metal dragon! I first got a wicked picture in my head... I think you should draw the five. ^_- I think that they would look really cool.Anyways, I'll tell you what I got out of it... the whole idea of Kai standing in that painful position brought up the idea of like, self-perseverance. And I really liked the part where his father was talking about not showing off your strength. I though that was a good theme too.  The thing I liked most about it, is that you didn't just sit there and start talking about things for no reason... it all sprouted from Kai. No rambling.If you guys haven't read it, I suggest you READ IT! Good stuff Pho, really good stuff!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
BAN!!!Ha hahaha! I loved that part... good stuff, good stuff.  8)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I actually really surprised myself with how that one came out. I'm not really good a computer coloring, so you can imagine I was pretty happy with that! I'll fill you in on a little trick that I leaned on skin that really gives it some life...After you coloring it all up, grab a big, soft paint brush (I use the size 65 one) and get a vibrant red. Like RED red. Then set the opacity to 0 and gently give him some color around the cheeks, nose, ears, knuckles, and places like that.I found that that really gives some depth!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
AH yes! It's good to see the old site being rebuilt. I have to ask though... what happened to all the Ecco stuff? I mean... this is an Ecco site, right? I just want to know if you still have it all, or if you really are starting from ground zero.  That would bite ass... ._.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Unfortunately, I can't say the same. I don't think I remember you, but what does that matter? Welcome back either way Ankou!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hes creating managers for the content. We still have all the original stuff, we just have to put it up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey Cally, it's good to hear your alright! And please continue to be so. ^_-Love and prayers are with you and your family!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey! Yeah, I think you're right, Arkon! That's the time I came around, maybe a little bit before that. I don't even remember how I came to this site. o_O;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah, I see! I'll have to try that!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Speaking of Sten's comics, where is Sten?? I haven't seen her around here in ages, and I'm starting to get worried about her; I hope she's OK...  :(
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oooh....I like the St. Gabriel's, too! Now whenever I listen to that song, I'm gonna think of that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Not an ecco site? o_o; That would be the day.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heheh...well, I do have to thank you Trellia for tracking me down on AIM...I'm not on there very often, and to see someone other than Arkon make an attempt to reach out to me, was quite nice...  ...so, again...thanks!It's so good to see the rest of you welcome me back like you have... :D ...you're so kind to remember me! I honestly thought everyone here had forgotten of me, and that's probably what postponed my return so long. I'm just glad between Trellia and Arkon, they could convince me to come back! I've missed you all, really...and it'll be great to chat with you once again here!So...is everyone still as into Ecco as ever? When's the last time you guys played the game? Anyone working on fan art/fics?Heheh... ;) ...that was a great game, eh Fargal!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
so you can buy it! I think I will, such a pretty design.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
im doing alot of programming. thats why you dont see many updates. programmnig soemthing like the content manager or the profile manager takes weeks. its sad but it saves alot of time in the long run. when im finished i will have the ultimate site. a site with no equals...and yes i plan to get all the ecco content up and more. its just not as easy as you think. all the content is in its original html format. my new site is pure php and database driven. i have to convert everything. one might say it be logical to put up the old html stuff but the files are all broken images with still useful information. i have to rebuild every page. it doesnt take that long if you rememebr chrismas last eyar when i introduced the defender of the future look. but my estimation is it would take a month. right now my next goal is to make a manager for fan ficts and poetry (it will be one manager) then possibly a code manager (for the ecco sections.) then i'll start working on putting stuff back up.since i finsihed the profile manager im working on a relly good flash movie (i hope) ^^;; and hope to have more work on the site ther eon afterwards.oh shitheres my plands laid out.1. make flash movie.2. put comic section back up with sprites so people can create new comixs3. poetry and story manager.4. code manager5. rebuild site.it has to be done in this exact order. and its not relly fun. thats why im taking a break now and doing a flash movie. thats my way to relax and take a break.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well we enjoy having you around. even though the site can be dead at times.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hmm it ahs been a while. i hope i didnt piss her off in the chat. i should contact her through icq sometime see whats going on.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I submitted my entry, and I advise everyone should forget my old "artwork" NOW. YES. Looking back at it over the weekend, I realised how bad it really was. Like brillos, without the pad. Messed up and...messed up. Thankfully I have produced some much finer pieces recently, yet they retain my "cartoony" style in some form eg the eyes (take a look at my mouse art avatar D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That last quote came from one of my old teachers as well...He said it's just a poem by someone I can't remember.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*high fives Crestoe* let's forget the old fights okay?    I'm cool with you now too...You know, I feel very old when I think back at things... 2 years... Geesh... It just sounds weird! I remember when Ark got kicked out of the house... I came to the Undercaves when Arkon got unbanned. I vaguely remember blackfin and meghan remember me being all against Arkon, and then suddenly realising I'm wrong... Gwa, I remember a lot of stuff, I remember the Zelda message board war    I remember me fighting with Crestoe when Arkon was away... *sighs* That was pretty horrible. I remember flooding the message board, and getting banned... I remember getting unbanned. I actually remember many many things. And right now I feel like an old grandma sitting on a bench in the park and telling stories about the Olden Days *pfffffff**evil grin* Hey Crestoe did you REALLY stay up at night to monitor the MB?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, *modest* I'm quiet famous between my friends for sudden splashes of quotes... Here are a few of my personal favoritesp
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm not sure about there being an evil asterite of the past, because when Ecco first encounters it, it says "I remember you," or something to the effect. Hmm, as I remember Asterite says "I remember you" when Ecco meets it in the first place in the present days (Ecco I). And in the pre-historic era where Asterite has sent Ecco to collect its lost globe there was an 'evil version' of it, which even attacked Ecco. I still don't get, why... Heh, besides if we try to think logical, Ecco has taken that globe from the Asterite of the past and it appears that it most likely destroyed it (Asterite of the past, I mean). Then, how come that Asterite still existed when Ecco has returned to the present? Or, perhaps it was really a twin brother of it like Kitnee says? :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
A-yup, same here. o_o My art was too cartoony, too. I've evolved since then (I think! ^^;;;), so that art's way too old to even be considered art contest material. ._.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah the Asterite, so mysterious.I know him as a huge DNA stran that has much knowledge of the planet. If he was from another world, he musta liked earth well enough to evolve into that silver like form in ToT.Are you talking about what he looks like in the future? We've had this discussion before, and we thought it was either a ghost or just the Asterite had aged and was now old and grey.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, Nori...and of course our resident hero, Trellius. I do hope they're both okay and safe.  :(
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well to bad when i get a chance to put them back up i will do it. so ha o_o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sure thing, Atolm! ^_^er....you have an anthro character? o.o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
As a matter of fact, yes i did. I was not logged in as a cover up and didnt sleep to monitor the board incase of floods and what not. I put the board on maintenance mode and checked the whos online and waited for the threat to pass. Not much of monitoring, but i didnt sleep that night cuz i was up on the comp deleting messages and coming up with better childish insults.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Eh? Who else has your name?Oh, and how rude of me. Welcome.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just a quick introduction first. I'm Nemesis, and I've been quite actively involved in hacking the sonic line fo games for the past year or more. I'm taking a short vacation from the sonic games right now though, and I thought I'd take a look at this rom in perticular. The ecco series of games has always been one of my personal favorites, and I feel this beta holds one of the hreatest potentials for discovery out of all the ones I've ever seen. Yesterday I started doing some work on this rom, and right now I'm in the preliminary stages of documenting the basic structure of the game. Well, I did this quite by accident while trying to transfer the mapping and sprite data from one level to another//homepages.ihug.com.au/~nemesis2k2/junk/eccotot.jpgMaybe it was in one of the games, but I sure as hell can't remember it. It's been ages since I've played them all through from the start to the end though.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Normally my username is just Nemesis, but since I've just found out that was taken, I've used Nemesis1207, which is my AIM handle.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
o_O Okay, but then how did you get the actual name to post. Or is it just a super odd coincidence that theres 2 nemesis's here right now?As for your old account, we probably lost it when we updated our forum for the billionth time.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
There are two of us, which could get a little confusing.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Not as long as you have the avatar and signature. Damnit all. Well, i can asure you most noobs dont stay around too long, and then we can set you up with yer normal name but i doubt it'll be too much of a problem. And if it does, people will die. o_o;; (Well..not really... ._.; )A good example of confusion is this topic cuz i thought you were the first nemesis. Arghhh.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes, I won't be here for quite some time, until our internet is fixed, you'll see less of me lately, our internet is destroyed, infact, all of ourcomputer is, I have to use my dad's. anyway, it's just temporary, so I'll be back,don't worry. :(

Mind you, that was 2 years ago you fucking... Alastor...!!!

Really? Where!?

<br />
<div id='container'>
Er... do me a pic of my sea creature character, but I wanna see her in a humanoid form. that should be somwehat of a challenge for ya. =DOh yeah, what did you want me to do?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yep I am talking about him.A ghost? Now that is new to me. We should do a Ecco halloween special when the time comes.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I remember that fella. You encounter him in the prehistoric levels. He can be found in two levels, one for sure is the Dark Water level and i cannot remeber the other level. Can you get a sprite of this guy? It would be a nice touch to the sprite icons that will be up soon.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well I'd rip him from his proper level for that, so he'd have his correct palette n all.Anyway, here's a little something some of you might find useful. In the Ecco 2 preview rom, enable the PAR code FFA94E7FFF to set the water level far below the bottom of the screen. Kinda amusing watching everything plummet to the seabed.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i have to admit thats actualy pretty interesting. we have our own little hacking team that kinda have been.....well.... hmmm -_-;anyhow thats pretty awesome i'll have to show my buddy epicenter.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*proud* Means I DID achieve something hehe the whole point of the MB flooding was to make you suffer    Oh well, yeah it was two years ago and mind you I think we're all pretty much over it... :p
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
nemesis... No... nemesis... Argh... Okay. *deep breath* I'm confused already. Which one of you just joined? Ah-ha...  That topic review thing IS useful. Welcome nemesis

<div id='container'>
..... Couldn't find a mask for St. Gabriel. Or a cross. But this works too//store6.yimg.com/I/americancraftsonline_1719_250556005The cross of St. Brendan, the navigator........All pictures, of course, belong to their respective websites.I like that and the first one...Or, if you'd like, get a tattoo of it - if you want.   8)  (dang, I'm giving you ideas   :D )
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I know Epicenter from the sonic hacking scene. He's asked me to help out with hacking this game a few times now. It's taken about six months, but I've finally got around to it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I decided to get the site fixed up a bit and added a new sectionhttp//arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Chronus&amp;file=index&amp;func=cpm_indexjust thought id inform everyone on whats up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
welcome back i do remember you. all i gots to say is if you want your old name back let me know and i can change the existing one your using back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
luckily these days we have people like dolhpin who never sleeps. also this is probably the most secure site on the net. anything bad they could do to me i can do much worse back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
no all we got to do is bring him back here. you came at the right time. my site went dead for a while and i got kinda lazy after all my content was fucked up. so your plannnig return was hopefully at a perfect time. ;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the asterite of the past is the same one of the present. it probably sensed ecco was going to steal tis globe and thats why it attacked him. i belive that story ties in with the story i told about the asterite being a visitor.ecco took the globe rendering the asterite stuck. the globe of the atserite was taken to the future to an older asterite.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
trelluis will be back. hes been an active member of this site for a long time. i think in his case it has to do with school. the guys an expert.as for sten. i havent had a chance to contact her yet.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well that sucks its too bad common people dont know how to fix there own computers. then again my bro cant even fix his if soemthing happened. and even funnier its always been easy for me to do it.anyhow i wish i could help but i cant ._. dman this recheated screen

Why does everyone want me to leave?   I've used this name on message boards hundreds of times.

<div id='container'>
Yeah, you're right, Arkon. Let's hope he gets back soon to give us some more wisdom. ;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, nifty! But maybe you should have put this in the Ecco Hackers section, so we could have something in there. ;)Yeah, that's the seahorse that shoots bubbles or baby seahorses at you or some shit like that. o_o

<div id='container'>

Nobody wants you to leave, he's just saying that if you ever do leave he'll take your old name.Grah, this reminds me of the whole Stenellya/Stenella thing. X_x
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Speaking of Sha, I guess he's always workig in the background like some nested Windows application, making sure we all don't go BSOD again. But how come he almost never posts? Is it because he's so busy?
</div>

<div id='container'>
Pfff I remember Arkon thinking I was copying his name ages ago... I mean AGES ago. Ankou and Arkon sound kind of alike. Must be that A and K. I remember bumping on another Ankou on another message board. That was NOT nice... I ended up leaving that mb cause I couldn't get used to being called Ankou(put a bunch of numbers here)...I guess we can get used to having two nemesises around, it's not that bad :)

ONLY Ecco games? *sigh* I've only played DotF, so count me out.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, since this is an Ecco the Dolphin site, it would make sense to have reviews for Ecco games only. o_OEDIT: Arkon, did you know that the description for Ecco Jr. is the one for Defender of the Future? Did you do that on purpose just to stick up some text to test the module or what?
</div>

How do you change your name/delete your account? I have a different name I could use that would be similiar yet totally different.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow....that didn't take long...My dad said it would take him a looong time to get it straightened out. So, I told you guys that I might not be on for a while. Now he fixed it with a virus killing program. We lost everything, of course, but we'll get it back eventually. :x

<div id='container'>
Baby seahorses. How disturbing, shooting your  babies at your enemies. I guess you need some ammo.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Arkon, its no wonder you haven't heard about it. Americans don't show news of stuff happening down here, only if its some major crisis that might threaten you guys too.. Sorry that that sounds a bit offensive but its the truth ^^;; So far the fires have died down, but we're still being cautious as the Namagi Nat'l park is still on fire and thats to the east of us, but I think that the worst is over. The tally of houses that have been destroied is now just over 500, and now the ruins are falling over and sending Aspestos into the air *snort* fun.   :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually Cally I read the newspapers all the time so you can understand my amazement on why it is not in the  newspaper in the first place. I usually know what is going on in the world events but I have not seen this in the paper! Something like this should be in the paper too..... hum...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I heard on the radio that the fires there are dieing down a bit. let's hope it keeps reducing.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sorry I'm so late - I just haven't noticed this topic before... :(Yeah. I heard about those horrible forest fires that are allready very close to Kanberra in the newson TV. I very hope that it would be stopped somehow...Anyways, I'm terribly sorry to hear this, Cally *hugs*. I hope that you and all other people who lives there will be okay.Again, sorry for posting so late...

I discovered St. Brendan's cross after having my phoenix/dolphin medalion made at a mideval fair. I probably would have had that put on if I had noticed.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm in the opposite situation. My dad's computer runs the internet and needs a new hard drive. So my computer (held together by string and bubblegum) does all the work now. The good thing is I get internet on my computer. The bad is I do all my stuff with my dad right behind me. Hurts motivation.

Hmm, two nemesisis. Would that be one nemesi?Well, welcome aboard. Reading around the thread, I think I've figured out. I do seem to recall a nemesis joining a while back. So, nemesis, why don't you make a mirror image of nemesis1207's avatar. It doesn't have to be for long. Just for a day or so. Oh! And then- *is dragged into the back room*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
you first arkon. ;)Yeah, and I thought it was common knowledge that peter pan was gay, hell even his peanut butter sucks.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
no he's just too above us to post. OWNED!....well, except for mindless _S posts and inane links...but only to make us think he's a lunatic.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yeah I don't think she enjoyed your nazi talks arkon. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Er... do me a pic of my sea creature character, but I wanna see her in a humanoid form. that should be somwehat of a challenge for ya. =DOh yeah, what did you want me to do?Your Atolm character?  Yeah...o.o;  It will be hard, but I'll do my best.Um...well, like I said on my original post here, I don't really care that much.  It would be really great if you could do Tethys or one of my other Ocean Guardian characters, but if you'd rather do something else it's up to you.  I'm not very picky--at least not as far as which of my characters people draw.
</div>

<div id='container'>

You had a medallion made at a fair? Is it the ones where they stamp the images on a piece of silver or bronze?I have one too, I got the dolphin/western dragon combo.

<div id='container'>
i remember when i had to go to friends houses and had to deal with that. it isnt until you pay for your own things that you can tell your parents to screw off.i pay for my moms internet. o.o (also my bros internet)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Arkon, its no wonder you haven't heard about it. Americans don't show news of stuff happening down here, only if its some major crisis that might threaten you guys too.. heh your only saying that cause like you and the rest of the world you been infected by anti-american whatever they call it.i read the news paper every day but havent heard anything about it. and how could you say that when you know damn well you cant speak for americans if your not american.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
nazi talks? explain alastor. seems all you do is say things without evidence.

Oh...khay... Now who the fuck is dolphin, why does he never sleep and... Anyway... explain... I'm confused.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hehe... nobody gives a fuck about what I do. Luckly my parents grew me up with the belief that I'm "such a good girl"... Haha prooves that the fact that if you know a person for A LONG TIME doesn't mean you know a lot about them. They dunno a shit about me, and everybody seems to be perfectly happy with that. The whole home computer network hangs on me though, I fix everything, I make everything work and they just pay the bills... Well at least I won't have to wait for anyone to fix my comuter for me if it ever brakes

That site is horrible... Only click that link if you're fully assured of your nervous stability...Now back to quotes."Don't worry, I'll come back early (..... ) I said early (..... ) I presume you'll be still asleep"~ Me
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmmm you can't speak for americans either, arkon. Cause being an american you tend to be unobjective, I mean come on, we all think (no matter how anti-racist we try to appear) that our country rules. So as they say, if you look around and see there is something wrog with the world, look at yourself and most probably the problem is in you. All the anti-america or whatever cannot be totally baseless.

Heya Sundance! Welcome to the site.... More content is coming up soon but the look is something.. Oops... I'm not supposed to be saying all this, Arkon is   So anyway, great to see some new faces. Welcome  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah Hi! It is always good to get new members on this stie. Just stick around and have some fun.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Dont forget about the skins, plenty of other looks for this site if your bored of it. And pay no mind to Alastor, he is hated by all. And the sad thing is, he knows it. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You had a medallion made at a fair? Is it the ones where they stamp the images on a piece of silver or bronze?Yeah, that's it. The drop hammer. I still have the selection sheets. Their version of the cross has little fins so they look more like dolphins. They also have a native american Humpback Whale. I could, in theory, scan some and put them up, but my scanner no longer works. So maybe later.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah, yeah, welcome and all. I'm the blue guy who does.... stuff. I think. Someday I'll do what I'm supposed to do and suprise all.
</div>

I'll wager I have it somewhere. Or one of them.I have an animated .gif by Mooky that claims to be Ankou.

Har. I definately don't think our country's the best - we have the most opportunities, but we also have the most arrogant sons-of-bitches for a population this world has ever seen. That and the fact that we don't know how to keep our noses out of other people's business. Look where that's got us.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh Arkon *chuckles* I was only saying what I said to make a point. You guys seem to always be in our news, but the only time Aussies will ever see light in american news would be if someone nuked us *chuckles* I am far from anti-american as I have so many friends up there ^__^ Sorry if I offended you - I was only making a point from my own personal oppinion. Anyways. The house destruction total has reached over 500. Thefires have died down somewhat around here, but there is one on our Canberra border to the south west - if the widns change and it does come up this way, Conder and Banks are screwed. But I highly doubt that it'll reach here. Its about 17km's away, thats about from my house to Woden *somewhat on the other side of town*. So, about 20 mins away. But we have Incredible Hulk and George of Peaches flying over us the whole time and dumping water on it ^^ Yay for them! *giggles* oh and Eao, send me snoooow D

Snow.... *dreamy sigh* Send snow here! It snowed here last year, first time in 10 years O_o was a national disaster lol, these dumb greeks can't handle cold weather... I was kinda hoping it would snow this year too, I mean we missed like a week of school and played snowballs outside, was great. Of course all the greeks were hidden inside their houses wiating for the "terrible thing" to melt... They looked at us as though we were some rare creatures... Great times.Callyfin, I have hear about he fires in Australia, and sounds horrible to me! I remember when fires were around Athens and my guinea pig died from gas poisoning... The sky was black with smoke, I hope everything turns out alright for you.I'm not completely anti-american, I have many friends who are american and I think they're great people... But I also think that lately America's been thinking too much of itself... Like police the world... Fight for peace... Two words: As if! Why not sort out your own country first? The fact that you're on the other end of the ocean doesn't give you the right to create war on this end. Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't everybody mind their own business? Afghanistan, Iraq, North Korea... Relax people!Okay shutting up.

Having a guinea pig die from something as disgusting as that is horrible, it suffocates them then they die slowly from the inhalation. *hugs Ankou* We came very close to loosing alot of the animals in the street, as the smoke was so thick that it was effecting them greatly. I'm sick at the moment from the smoke myself ^^;; And I have some sort of head cold ontop of that ^^; Dad and I have put ourselves on a part of alert now, as there is a huge fire on out southwester border, and as I said before, if it comes over the ridge, Conder is screwed ^^; I still think it'd be rare for it to come over, but I still haven't unpacked all the stuff I packed when we whee going to leave :D I'll be prepared if it comes ^^;;

http://www.petitiononline.com/ecco3drm/petition.htmlthats right Appaloosa has been falling behind with the times. I'm not sure if there will ever be a second Ecco but lets try to get everyone together and force them into making a new Ecco. PsySonic set this up and seems like a fun idea. Who knows. appaloosa might fall for it.So my dear friends lets join together and get people in on this.im looking at this again and must make a correctin my post. its for a partition to remake ecco one and two from genesis to the new 3d flavor.still it would be an awesome touch since the original ecco's were the best!

HOLY SHIT! Was that DreadLord?! I haven't seen him in a while!

Why was this made into a new topic again? O_o;;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, he kinda is a noname if you think about it. His "name" is "Not-Nomad," which isn't really a name. I dunno. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Done. But the sad part is, if they do make an Ecco, they won't make it for Dreamcast. Oh well, maybe they'll make it for PC so I can still play it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I know. Now I'm not sure about hospitals over where he lives, but I know that most of the hospitals that I've been to because of what happened to my dad have really been shitty. It's too bad we can't have better health care in America. And sadly, ours is probably the best health care available.

I'm not sure if any of you have/do play SSX Tricky, but if someone could help me I'd be grateful...I didn't realize that that when the characters get pissed at you... they stayed pissed... forever. So it seems I've inadvertently made a lot of enemies in the game. Aheh heh! ._.;;;Sure I can do that easy enough, but does anyone know how to get them un-angry at you? There has to be something to bring their gauge down, right. Anyone?

Kewll PS2, my bro just got that, so I've been going nuts, buying a chip for the console so it can play copied games *evil grin*... Now I borrow games from the video club, copy them and ta da   Hmmm... Ankou... Well I guess it all satrted like 5 years ago when I wanted to write a little story with a soldier-girl in it... And I did kinda want her to represent me in a way, so I took the An part of my real name which is Anna, and twisted the end bit to make it sound more original (I hate my name simply because it's too damn common). Eh, the story tuned out to be crap, but the name stuck... I use it online for the past 5 year (geesh am I THAT old), and even some of my real life friends call me Ankou   I slap whoever calls me Annie, Anky or anything of the sort... Anka or Ankou and that's that...Sheesh, that's looong, I sure do like to talk about myself

Its about freaking time. We were wondering where you had went.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Indeed - welcome, welcome! And don't worry about your English - there are people I know who have grown up learning it, and you speak better than them! ^_~But I think someone ought to start a Newbie Thread so new people won't have to keep making new topics.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*hugs Sten* Hey! Welcome back! So sorry to hear that you were ill, and about the arguing with your dad.  :(  But I'm glad that everything's OK now! ^_^

*late*hi ankou, i missed you. heh you rapscallion, i remeber the whole 6/5 art gallery thing awhile ago that got you banned. but i am glad to see you back. you were one of the people i met when i first came to arkon.com. i still remeber that avatar mooky made for you.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
alright, ill fill the question on what happened to trellias bayyes, in short answer, it died when the site went down. i could always get it back up, but ive seemed to lost interest in all the uploading and editing it would require. before it died i never updated it anyways, it was just an archive. arkon can host the sprites, and it would be pointless to do all that work when someone else has them anyways.oh, plus my non full screen emulator doesnt work anymore, so i couldnt update anymore anyways.it was fun while it lasted :)
</div>
<br />

did you guys see the mp3s are up there now? not much different than what you hear in the game *shrugs*

You all haven't noticed, but I have been gone for a little over a week now.It all started when i tried to format my comp. It gave me some problems, and when i tried to get Photoshop back, I got a brand NEW virus. So I tried once more to get my shit back together. I tried installing windows XP which did not bode well for me, and I am reminded of my faults everytime I restart my computer.I dont know how long this piece of fucking crap is going to last, but I am back online for now. I will NOT be getting Photoshop, or any other godamn shit that could mess me up. I am still tweaking my comp and am not sure if I will have to format or not once more. This post is just to tell you why I have disappeared, and why the fuck I am not getting shit for this site done. It is no excuse, obviously, and I am sure I will have to deal with a very pissed off arkon soon.Needless to say, Im sorry for not getting anything done. I officially need a new comp, and I have become a useless member of society. I officially hate computers.More news about my predicament after I speak with "Lord Arkon."
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks for reading, Arsenal!You were right about self preservance. It was a whole kind of theme based on that. It was really based on my own experiences in martial arts, which after reading that, you probably have seen have been painful ones. The thing about hiding strength was taught to me by my Sifu, and I thought it was a great thing to put in there. I am going to write more martial arts stuff in the future. Maybe this will show off that the only stories I write aren't about swimming mammals. Thanks for the praise though. Didn't think anyone would want to read my stuff.If you ever want to read more, and critique it, that would be great. You can reach me at neo_020@hotmail.com  I hope all the vultures out there that want to spam me with retard forwards refrain from using this email adress though. It has enough garbage in there.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I get that a lot. What I mean is, by saying that you're someone, you don't have a definite name picked out. So you really are kinda like a noname.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No, I didn't, but I'll go and do that now.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
We could never forget about you, Nori!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yech. I wish you all the best, DL. Good luck to you! Being in the hospital's no fun at all, so make sure you get out quick, okay?
</div>

I'm sure arkon will be perfectly understanding. ^_^;...or not and we could find your dead body tied to a cactus in the desert years later. ^_^; Chin up!

Damn that was some good rhyme.I need to send an email to my computer company (I dont own them...but they made my computer) About how to cure this problem I am having with dos, and the phantom of windows XP.I hate computers.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah yes, very very touching. I love you all. (Probably more than some of you deserve.) But this heart warming topic about cool comics that Sten made is older that Phosis being canadian. (Couldnt come up with better) So nothing personal, but this topic must come to a close.So nothing personal...*L0xx0rz j00r b0xx0rz *

In the meantime while I waited for my computer to fix it's problems, I had to use the comps in school. It made me produce something to keep me cheered up enough to survive the lonely, compless nights, where I actually went out and DID shit, like, talk to girls. It is a little story. But not a story. Think of it as an anime that skipped the animation progress, and went straight to shoddy novelization.It was a trick for me to write, as all of my work is serious, in novel format. It basically says to the people at fanfiction.net, that, "Since you all write like shit, if you cant beat em, join em."If you like martial arts, it is worth a read. If you like crappily emulated anime humor, it is worth a read. And if you want to support this out of work writer, then it is worth a read, and a review.Enjoy it, for what it's worth, and dont expect it to be a serious piece of literature. I have too many of those crammed up my ass, and I needed something that was fun to write, and that I didnt have to care about.In any case, give it a read, please and thanks.http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1198764

Take your time Nori, I know how time consuming school can be.

Is it my turn ? Must I do an anagram ?Yes it is. It's your turn now :)

I've thought Nikita was a neat name. Maybe it was because of Tolstoy. My suggestion to you is to get a face for the name. Find a good picture for an avatar.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OMG, you make it sound as though you're going on a fucking road trip or something!    Good luck anyway! My depth stupy in Biology was kidneys (we did those god damn things for like 2 months!!!) of course I slept through most of the lessons but I couldn't ignore the "field trips" to the hospital... Kidney transplants are freaky! Good luck!!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's a good story! I enjoyed reading it... The moral of it isroll:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Nikita for me assossiates with the tv series   But I think it's great! Tolstoy comes second... After i read Artreus' post I'm like "oh yeah I THOUGHT it rings a bell"

Aaah the crap I done *dreamy smile* I'm not ashamed of myself at all actually... Weird... I ought to be O_oOh and Crestoe, those three are synonyms... not alive, unalive and dead mean the same thing just the two last ones are more correct   Oh well, I'm not complaining, you're da boss

Damn... so no one knows, eh? Gamefaqs.com didn't help either. Well, poopie. Anyways, SSX Tricky is a snowbording game. Hella fun it is too. Even if you're not into snowboaring, I'd recomend  you'd rent it anyways. It's on PS2, Cube and the Box so there's plenty of opportunity!

Things are coming along well. I've figured out the format used to store and process the block mappings, level maps, and sprite lists. As of this point in time, I can modify the entire layout of a level, including collision and sprite placement.There are a few small novelty things I did just to see what would happen too that a few of you might like to do as well. Try these PAR codes0000 - Set the heath of the globe holder to 0. It doesn't bust, but the result is interesting none the lessFFD1A0FFFF - Complete the asterite. For any of you who have knowledge of hacking, the first code is for one strand, and the second is for the other. Each of the 16 bits corresponds to one of the 16 globes in the strand. A 1 indicates it's present, while a 0 indicates it's not. Try entering a value like AAAA as opposed to FFFF to have one in every two globes present.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, and here are some other codes you might find handy7F00 - infinate healthFFA8F48000 - Set the water height way above the top of the screen

I agree with Eao. The head and the hands are good, but you (like me &gt;_@) need work on proportion. Try drawing from real life - ask a family member to pose for you, or look up anatomy on the Net. Or try drawing from porn. O_o
</div>
<br />

Doom, try GameWinners. Not only do they have cheat codes and junk, but they also have forums. Maybe you'll find someone there who can help.

Arkon owns the site, he does it rather well, But if you ask me 'bout it, i wish he'd learn to SPELL. Dreadlords on our site, his life is such a wreck. And if he tells me about it, i think i'll break his neck. Frieccos on our site, people call him Frie. If he ever saw the opposite sex naked, i think he'd scream and die. Phosis is on our site, his life sucks, thats no duh. But theres a very good reason, he hails form Canada! Dolphins in our chat, hes hardly ever around, Just dont ask for tips on life, hes liable to skip town. Alastors on our site and he never wanders far, Ask him about his sanity, hes got it in a jar.Atolms on our site, she's as sweet as candy, i have no good rhymes for her so she should be fine and dandy.yogoat has no girl friend, but hes still very coo', Just dont view his site, nothings ever new.EccoChick is my good friend, her singing is quite the best, she is hot and popular, Friecco likes to touch her chest! Vantid is an artist, you had better wish her well, Come time for that PMS, she'll punch you straight to hell.Stenellya's a nice girl from the land of France, shes great to meet for the first time 'cuz she seems Sane at ones first glance.WhiteFin and Moduvator are members on our site, i have 2 bucks on the match that says WhiteFin wins the fight. SilverFins in the chat, the man is great and humble. Hes a good admin on CoH, the users are Terrible. Crestoe made these rhymes, well thats all and fine...The man is a pathetic low life with too much free time. ._.Alastor is yellow, and he's a little bitch...he comes to our chat and he boggles our minds, Talking with fucking Phosis about Metroid Prime.Arkonviox.com is a great site to be, an insane assyluim without the key to lock up the degenerate heatens that fluirish in its sea. :)

I had to format, again, just like an hour ago. It fixed up all my problems, and I have 7 gigs free once more. (Meaning my 6 gigs of anime is obsolete) I need a new comp. but this states my permenent return to the site.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hurray, now get your useless ass to work. o_oJust kidding. I need a new comp too, and a scanner. I havent done art in a year on this site. Pisses me off.

<br />
<div id='container'>
don't worry phosis just add some kick ass colors to it and that will shut them up.as for everyone else. if you add non ecco artwork up i will murder your families.the only reason pho can get away with it is cause hes my no paid employee.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeeeaah. Word to that...um...yo...Crest tang clan aint nuttin to fuck wit...or something.But at least you got the part about me being canadian right.

now that your back i can enslave you to help me work on this site.just let me know when your ready to work.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 Heheh...so...  Arkon, do you think you can consider giving the new girl here a gallery? I think I can draw allright, I just gotta do it more often... and I can't color at all YET... or is this not supposed to be discussed here?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You'll get a gallery when you get pictures done.
</div>
<br />

So far I have 3 that I consider good, but I'll have more soon cuz I'm on vacation from school so I have free time... Are 3 enough...?
</div>

HAHAHA, that is a really good rhyme there, Crest   8)  8)  ) ......   what the....?    
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*trhows some rotten tomatoes at Arkon* I'm speechless... As if!Nikita, Tolstoy is one of the greatest Russian writers. He wrote a novel about Nikita too. Though it has nothing to do with the tv series whatsoever.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I WAS wondering what happened to vandit and swift... What you said does explain a lot.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hehe it's kewl  8)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well crest, don't you have another project to work on anyway? -_-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I fixed an inconsistincie in the Ecco Jr. Section. The description used for it was the same one from ecco DOTF, and it looked kind of ridiculous, so I re-wrote it as best I could to have to do with Ecco Jr. I also went through the different sections and fixed them all for spelling. Cassandra doesn't say "Owr" anymore in the storytelling.Just thought you should know.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Aww...that sucks about Van and Swift. We lost two great artists, but most of all, we lost two wonderful people who have been here since the Dark Ages of this site.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well...maybe they got abducted by THQ. No, seriously - after all, it was THQ who made the accursed Sega Smash Pack, with the shitty version of Ecco on it. Maybe they merged or took over or something?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Speaking of Epicenter, what the fuck is he? I haven't heard from him since the site went down months ago.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Word up, yo.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i kenw about that. is there a prologue for ecco jr.?mainly that part of with the text is ment for pro logues. my only problem was i didnt have ecco jr. prologue.other then that good work phosis.

Tolstoy is a little gloomy for my liking. In Master and Man, Vasili was a rich man you died to save Nikita, his serf. Or was Vasili a different story? I have an interest in Russia, which I guess carried over to Tolstoy.As for your pictures, they might be neat to see. I once tried to draw for the site, but was never quite happy with anything I drew. So I make sprite comics. Somewhere in between drawing and... playing Ecco for screenshots :?  maybe?

Yeah I saw them Artreus, I like the blue heroes comic and the alternate endings, that was funny! :D My problem with my drawnings is that I don't know how to do anything with them on the PC, I'll have photoshop soon but then I'll still have to learn it....bah

Ah yes, the peter pan site. I knew that site from some time before. As I can remember it had cool links about people dessed like a fairy (and not all of them are females) . Not bad.As a curiosity, check the visit counter. A guy dessed as Peter Pan with a nightmare haircut  and cheap html gets 3700000 hits. Meanwhile, good ol' Arkon achieved 100000 hits in two or three years of hard work at this site.Internet is the axis of the evil.

I bought a book. Im no artist. But it would be fun to be one. I tried my hand at drawing a few times, and I think I am enjoying it. So I thought, perhaps a book will help me not fail. I was wrong.I picked up "Anime-Mania" AKA, "The most horribly flashy embarresing book of all time". It teaches you how to draw american anime. What that means, is anime drawn in america. In other words, anime that looks american, so doesnt look like anime at all. Take a read at an excerpt from the book.It is how to draw a "High tech punk gal." Whatever the FUCK that means."The High-tech punk gal is trained in all sorts of sophisticated military operations" Nifty! "She's always in contact with her team members, communicating with them even in the middle of enemy territory!" Wow, what a teamster!So basically, jackass teaches us to draw some bitch he came up with at the top of his head. In an ENTIRE 4 frames. Here is basically how this guy teaches you to draw."Draw a circle. Add some lines to the circle. Sketch a mouth, and eyes. Then, add hair, a body, the other facial features, and your done! Easy as pie!" Good fucking job. Now I know about 1 tenth more about drawing then I knew before I read your 30 dollar piece of shit. In the quest for art, I hath failed. If any of you know of any good drawing sites, or anything, for the love of christ, please inform me. Otherwise, I will scan this godamn book into my hardrive, and force all of you to read it, page by page o_o;By the way...I am taking this motherfucker back.- Another rant from your friendly neighbourhood Pho Pho.

The challange was figuring out how to do it exactly.  I had to put the horn on her forehead cuz it just didn't work very well on her nose...x.o;Used a tutorial for the water.  Just so nobody thinks I did that all by myself (well, I did it myself, but with help. o.o;  Yeah...that makes sense...)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes, I'm sure the subject line is leaving you all wondering. o.o;  At least, I hope it is.  Cuz then you'll want to read it.  Um...I'm not absolutely certain this topic should really go in the art discussion...but it IS art...sort of...And I did some of it.Okay, so what the hell am I yapping on about anyway?  Well, I'll tell you.Lemon-Lime Soda is the name of a sprite comic that a friend and I have begun working on.  Yes, I know, just what we need--another sprite comic.   Anyway, my friend is actually the one who does all the funny stuff.  At least we both agree that it's funny, and he says some of his friends like it.  So I hope eveyrone else will think it's funny.  He also puts together the comics themselves.  My part in it all is that I made all of the sprites.  Okay, so I edited them.  And it's the first time I've done that, so they're not the best, but they don't look too bad.  All the characters are fan characters--there are no Sega charcaters in this (it's Sonic-based), although there is a remote possibility some might make guest appearances.  But that's not up to me.My other part in this is I'm the one maintaining the site.  Right now it's on Tripod and I'm using FrontPage for everything.  But the only reason is that Keenspace is recovering from some problems it had and is currently not taking applications.  Once they start taking them again, we'll hopefully be able to join.  So why is it called Lemon-Lime Soda?  Well, it's a pun.  When I was trying to come up with a name, I started thinking about what are other things that are associated with the word "sprite".  I came up with two things--little fairy-type critters, and Sprite...the soda.  Sprite is lemon-lime flavored.  So, that's where the name comes from.Anyway, I didn't tell you about this only to not provide a link.  So here it is, the temporary location (hopefully)//members.tripod.com/lemonlime20/Since it's Tripod, you'll probably have to copy &amp; paste the address in order for it to work.Anyway, please check it out and let me know what you think!There's two things I want to know How the sprites look (cuz I made them)#2: What you think of the comic itself.  I didn't write any of it, but I still want to know what people think.

<div id='container'>
Teth, it's pretty good, but you really need to change the font colors, or at least put the text in front of a translucent speech bubble or something - I can barely read what Tiarra says.

(well, I did it myself, but with help. o.o;  Yeah...that makes sense...)It does make sense, Teth - I do that all the time.

Yeah. Kitnee is right. it burns my eyes.I am used to sarcastic humor about suicide, and smoking drugs. Even Penny arcade wasnt that funny when it started. Keep up with ideas, and whatnot, and you might have something good going there. It is too early to get into it, at least for me, but the sprite work is hella good. (If im not mistaken, the backgrounds and some of the sprites are from Joe &amp; Mac)

Oh, and I thought I might post this too. There's actually a debug menu for the 3D stages, but they made changes to the sprite handling code after it was made, and now the letters used to display it are being written over after the first few sprites are displayed. You can access it just by hitting start, but unless you do it at the start of the level, it just looks scrambled.http://homepages.ihug.com.au/~nemesis2k2/junk/eccomenu.jpgleft decreases the time decrement, and right increases itdown increases the difficulty, and up decreases itI don't think I've seen this mentioned anywhere, so I guess it hasn't been found yet.

I found some codes on various sites for Ecco Defender of the Future for PS2.I had crestoe and swift current test the codes out for me but both said they dont work.The wierd thing about these codes are they are all over the net. there for ecco for ps2.i cant tell if they work since i havent had a chance to test them myself.here they are please test them and give me feed backEcco The DolphinPassage From Genesis levelAs you start the Up &amp; Down level, swim around the cavern until you find the Info Crystal. Below it is a hole that leads downward. The current is too strong -- you cannot swim down it. Look for the boulder just right outside the alcove where the hole is located. Push it into the hole and stay directly behind it. You will enter a room with four stone pegs. Above those pegs is the power of Sonar. Get the Sonar and use it in the small opening of the pegs. A little light should appear. Quickly light up all four and a door below will open to the 2D level.Pathways From Nowhere level After you make your way up the geyser, you will find a big ring with a spot of light in the middle. In that same area are many power jewels. Find them and bring them to the ring. Two are above the water, one is under the stone shack-like thing, and the rest are around the other side of the pool. After you have collected all of them. it will open the way to the bonus area.http://www.jbfdesigns.com/ps2/EccoDolphinDOTF.htmthats one of the sites i found them on.

Teth, it's pretty good, but you really need to change the font colors, or at least put the text in front of a translucent speech bubble or something - I can barely read what Tiarra says.Like I said, I only did the sprites and put the site together.  The comics themselves are all written and put together by my friend Jason.  If you don't think what he's written is particularly funny, it would be much worse if *I* wrote it.  As for the font and stuff, I have nothing to do with it.  But I myself haven't had any problems with the colors.  It was just the fifth comic where it was kinda hard to read because of the background, and Jason even agreed.I had to tell Jason to at least use a line or something to connect the text to the character who is speaking and to make sure that whatever is said first goes on top to make it less confusing.  And when the fifth one came out with the text being so hard to read over the bg, I told him he should try making speech bubbles.  He didn't want to do it because you wouldn't be able to see much of the background.  Niether one of us has any clue how to make transparant speech bubbles.  I figured you probably have to use Photoshop or something, but he only hasd Paint to work with.  Well, I suppose that I could do that part.  But I still have no idea how to make things transparant.  I'll have to figure it out, maybe try to find a tutorial or something, cuz I know that will make things easier to read if it had speech bubbles.As for now, I'll talk to Jason about changing the colors of the text.And, actually, other than the one background when they're inside the chao--and I have no idea where that came from--I believe all the bg's are from Sonic games.  And every single one of the sprites is from Sonic Advance, except the AOL guy--which, btw, is one that I did NOT make.  The sprites that I did are the four main characters (there's one more that hasn't been introduced yet) and the chao--which I barely did anything to.Yeah, so, you can praise the sprites all you want.  But if you have a complaint about the comic itself---it's not my fault. o.o;;  I just want to know what people think cuz I still am partly responsible, and I want people to enjoy it just as much as the writer does.

Dolphins used to help out the navy by detecting hidden mines in the persian gulf. Of course, we all know what "Detecting" Means. it means BLAMMO. So, the navy got together, and thought, "Shit. This isnt working. Dolphins are lazy in the summer, and not as effective. Waaaiiit..." Now, instead of our favorite finned friend detecting enemies and mines, we have a NEW form of animal abuse.sea lions! Thats right. sea lions can detect diving terrorists who set bombs on boats, and connect a small thing on their bodies, so that humans with guns can come down, and blast the bastards. But where does this leave the sea lion? Apparently in a better position then the dolphin.The sea lion is active all year round, and never gets "lazy" in the summer. Meaning, the navy is going to train a legion of deadly sea lion assasins to counteract the terrorist regime. Whats next in the future? I Predict that the air force is going to create a breed of "Kamkaze Endangered Bald Eagles." The eagles will carry grenades in their tallons, and shoot down at incredible speeds into terrorist camping grounds, Pecking at eyeballs, and potentially, destroying entire terrorist training camps. The eagles will let out a "Cry Of Victory" Seconds before hand, alerting the terrorists that they are not ordinary birds. Also, for illegal whale poachers, every 1 out of 100 killer whales will be known as "Whale-bombs", And have a high powered nuclear weapon sitting inside their stomach. At the point of their capture, the bombs will be activated, and will send all of those greasy poachers, (Plus, incidentally,  dozens of innocent sea creatures) To their ultimate demise.Of course, this is all conjecture. Except for the whole Sea Lion thing...They are actually doing that.

Nah, this forum isn't NEARLY as bad as 90% of the other forums on the net.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
AMEN!

<br />
<div id='container'>
Mainly because they probably are. o_o;;

Oh I caught the reference, I just didn't care because it was freaking stupid. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well then, best of luck to you. I wasn't very sucessful in my efforts, but thanks for trying.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
O.O;;For as long as I've had Photoshop, I never knew you could do that. Well, no, that's an understatement.  I've known for a short time but I never knew what it did.It works, too. o.oWow, thanks for the tip, Kit!  I just can't believe I couldn't figure it out for myself.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, but they don't rhyme with life. Well, if you spell it correctly, which goes against the philosophy of half of the forum.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
there are some screenshots of clan dolphins at  www.gamespot.com ... if you can find them :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's terrible....where did you hear this?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think the comic is off to a good start...just fix the text, it is a bit hard to read.Your editing of sprites is pretty good. =D Keep it up!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Stenella! Good of you to come back!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The world never fails to disgust me  :( ...I heard the sea lions are misteriously disappearing, that scientists are trying to find the cause but there are possibly a lot of them and nobody knows for sure who/what is guilty... Maybe this you said has something to do with it?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It was in a news report, on the tv.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
o_o true.

*hides in a dark corner* * I'm surrounded... compleatly surrounded... STAY AWAY FROM ME!!! :o *hysterical scream*

<br />
<div id='container'>
Oooh... I'm sooo insulted Phosis O_o. Anyway, when you know me, feel free to insult me, but you're gonna get insulted back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm sooo original! I spell correctly! I'm the outcast of the forum  
</div>

<div id='container'>
That is so horribly cruel! Those fucking shits are using endangered species as kamikaze's... I'm gonna become a sea lion activist!

Maybe he's just holding up the image of the forum. Bad spelling is in this forum's blood!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks Atolm, I got kinda lonley without CoH so I started posting a little more here, I just don't want to upset Stenellya.I'm looking through the site lizzy gave us........Since it won't let me look at the clan screenshots *U gotta join the site in order too* I can't help. Still I'll go try my best on making screenshots of my own, putting them on my site, and letting u have them.   8)

<div id='container'>
I'd say, a VERY good fanfic.U know about mine, I'm just finishing the 1st chapter. But already started the outline for the second. Thats one of the better fanfics Artreus. Very well done  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Maybe I should get around to writing ch.2 instead of just thinking about it. My mind works faster than my pen :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, Ankou. Your kind is wanted here. Get the fuck out o_o;nah Im joking. But you knew that anyway.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, don't worry about it. I dont insult. I just poke fun. As a bitter administrator, it is kind of my duty to do so.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Art, thats the only way you will ever get shit done. If you are like me, and talk about your projects constantly, people will stop caring, and they will never get done. But if you just force your ass to sit down, and write the shit down, it all comes together really quickly. I swear, writers block is nothing more then a fucking myth. If you keep your pen moving, (Or keyboard) Then the ideas will flow naturally. It works for me. You will be fucking surprised how fast the shit comes. Then, you go back and fix it up. Same goes with my novel. I always think about it, but never write it. When I do sit down and write it, My word count soars, in a matter of hours, and it turns out good.Something to consider.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I did some searching for you as well, when recieving screenshots for this site. Unfortunately, any pictures of clan dolphins I might have found would have been covered in logos. And we dont use pictures with logos for the site. Other then that, you can look through the gallery of this site for something suitable if your not having any luck.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
this is rare of me to say stenellya.but ha ha ha...i actualty missed you, you crazy french girl.im also glad to see your back. i didnt know you were sick but im glad your feeling better. this board has been kinda boring without you around.*blushes*   o^_^oThanks...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Okay...Hum...OHAFHETOIFONTSLEGNOS (4 words)

<div id='container'>
Hmmmm love is in the air....I'm just kidding!You don't know me but I like you, you're cool Stenellya  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 Uhh...............So, at least for now I chose the pink boto for my avatar... what do you think?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's pretty! I like it Nikita.   :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmmmm love is in the air....Me and Arky ?!Ho yeah !Come to hug your lil Sten, Arky !!   'smack !'Hahahaha !You don't know me but I like you, you're cool Stenellya  :)Thank you Nikita =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Eee *beams happily* Glad you like it ^___^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Teth, it's pretty good, but you really need to change the font colors, or at least put the text in front of a translucent speech bubble or something - I can barely read what Tiarra says.I think the same.It's cool Tethys, but I can't read the text at all...Aside that, the sprites are pretty  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I did check threw them. It was well timed actually, but the clan dolphins seem to be camera shy. I'm not in any hurry for the pic, but it would be nice to have. There are other things (including other comics) I can work on in the meantime.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's a unique look. Works well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
But if you just force your ass to sit down, and write the shit down, it all comes together really quickly.I've found nothing's closer to the truth than that. How else does one pound out three comics in a day?  Oh, and that amatuer gif I dropped in my sig.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I was browsing the web, when i found a cool strip by Penny Arcade that has to do with Ecco.http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2000-08-20&amp;res=lIf anyone has any other links to things, or has seen anything on tv, magazines, etc. That refers to ecco, post it up here

<div id='container'>
I'll try to... make it less blurry, when I have the patience heheThe guy who was supposed to install photoshop for me didn't show up! Again! =P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
In my opinion it's well written and very interesting. I'll wait to know what happens next, you got me curious...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hahaha, thats pretty good! They did a strip of PDO as well.I'll keep an eye out. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh dont worry, it is fine.Just dont be like me and constantly change Avatars. ^^;;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
oh jeeze, make it stop.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What Alastor, are you jealous?  :P

I did not realise that Arkon and Sten had some sort of secret life..... &gt;.&gt;Best if I keep out of it...*runs off*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I was considering changing it later... why shoudn't I? Sorry, I'm a libra, I have a hard time making simple decisions  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I am a libra too! =DYou can go ahead and change avatars i am just stating that i change mine too often. &gt;&lt;;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Really, what's your birthdate?Oh, I'll probably change it hundreds of times before I settle for one... But I like yours, it's so beautiful, how did you come up with that character?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
10-4-83my birthdate.As for my character.... I just made her up.I draw these sorts of things all the time.

<div id='container'>
oooo coooooool  8) Nice web site!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
There, that got your attention.In any case, i have started a new comic series. Why? Channel Darkseas was hard....I dont like hard things.This is called Vortex Future. It will be made whenever I feel, and is MUCH easier to do...More fun too.http://www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album54&amp;id=VortexFuture&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_photo.php

<div id='container'>
Mine is 10/16/85Wow, I think you're very creative, I saw your gallery...Do you write fanfic too or your character is just from your drawings?

http://arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album55&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.phpThats the first episode. I'll be putting them up variously. I came up with the idea with inspiration givin to be by our local nieghborhood Pho-Pho. But im left thinking...Do we really need another sprite series? Sprite comics? Everyone makes them and it aint easy to make a good product. I figured id make this since Grand Theft Yogoat is taking alot longer then it shoulda and this i can do between time. Its been awhile since ive ever posted anything in the art forum. -_-AITF will still go on, this is just something ive always wanted to do. I'll throw up another episode soon and then i want some feeback of what you think of the series. What do you think so far?This episode basicly is our grand hero, Ecco. Who never usually talks. But wait...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanx for the inspiration Pho Pho. Your comics rock. I decided to make my own inbetween making flash movies.Anyways, good job. Sorry to hear about Darkaseas, but this idea sounds grand.

Hey Crestoe, I think it's very well done, really great! :D

OMG Crestoe that's a whole line of text spelled correctly! I can't imagine how much suffering that caused you!   Just joking!

stenella's french they kiss everyone there  :x
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the only reason i have so many spelling errors is i dont care to correct them. i can get more replies done if i dont bother. another reason why i make so many mistakes is i only type with two fingers. if you seen how quick a typist i am in the chat you can put two and two together and relize i dont need to learn to type. but if i did it probably help me spelling alot.
</div>

thats fucked up.although your idea about whales with nukes in them sounds good. if anyone tries to capture them its....massive explosion of a chunk of the earth. if thats so whale poaching would be hard o.o

phosis you remind me of dreadlord for some reason. except unlike him you have catch phrases. i still dont have one ._.;Horay! or whatever.

Ankou, looking at your av...it's familiar. I've seen it before. Maybe I do remember you and I just forgot? Or maybe someone else was using that as their av at one time; I dunno. o_o

O.O;;For as long as I've had Photoshop, I never knew you could do that. Well, no, that's an understatement.

Heh. Every time we do peer editing in class for essays, I always tell the person I'm reviewing to keep pens away from me, else I mark the whole thing up.   I can't stand spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.

You're still mad at me, aren't you Arkon?

And Bush isn't?  As I said on one forum, "Because most of the Bush Administration spends 98% of their time jacking off, and spends the other 2% coming up with dipshit plans that everyone hates and revolts against."

It was set up as Jader's avatar at one time. That's were I got it from. Then I think MooKy came back for a short time and the connections were made for me.

Really? I thought you did. o.o

uahuahuah, arkon isn't mad at you,  he's just insane. ^_^

<div id='container'>
ha ha is Arkons catchfraise. Not a very good one either. o.o;Phosis doesnt seem like Dreadlord, you still think of him as Striker too much.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Arkons a libra too, and he has a hard time makign decision. Just Ask him how many Avatars he's went through!And to make it worse, i made all of the avatars he's used. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hahhaa. As always, Phosis hates his life. Very nice looking comics...funny as hell
</div>
<br />

Shit...I was found out. Yes, you are right! I did show this once before! Hahaha! And you'll never catch me! *runs away, looking like a school girl*

uahauhauhauahuahao.o;

I like to switch my avatars, but more periodically. I guess I should try and make a "once-a-month" avatar, where I change my avatars....once every month. o.O;;; Problem is, I don't have 12 different Kitnee avatars to go through. ._.

Yes! That's whose it was! What ever happned to Jader anyway? o_o

That's Delphi and Doomtrain's area. And since Delphi isn't around and DT is now Arsenal Fierce, it narrows your options, doesn't it?

I made two new channel darkseas comics. the first is low quality because of a faulty pen I was using, and the next is outlined in blue, cause the pen was blue. I changed the character design a bit, adding guidelines when i begin to draw them. Meaning, they all have the same general shape, and it is easier to do.http://www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album09&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.php

AH HAH! I found you...   ...Krystony! Heheh...I knew when I looked at your fanart I had seen it before...and here, on this site (other pieces too, but specifically "The Other Side of the Mirrors" - as I remember commenting on it while you were drawing it, here on this very board)! Hahahha...small world sometimes! Anyway, it's sooooo cool to hear of another SSX fan! I know you're all into Tricky...but that's cool still. Me, I got way supper into the original, got SSX Tricky, but didn't seem to like it as much...or rather, didn't get into it as much as the original. Anyway...I'm siked you joined up at the Gravitude! However, I have to ask (and I'm incredibly sorry for not remembering)...what the heck was your nick here before!?!? I know it was something other than Arsenal_Fierce...I just know it! Help me out guys...here...who would know/remember. Anyway...sorry to say I don't have an answer to your question about the "makin friends/enemies" issue, but GameFAQs is a great site as well to ask questions (I'm usually at the SSX one...not Tricky)...the SSX fanbase is rather nice...lots of people would love to answer it! Well...seeya around...

I found a painting of Mutaclone, but not a screenshot. Its in the artwork section of this forum.

Geez, I don't like the sound of having bombs in killer whale stomachs.I'd have to say, what the government is doing today is just stupid, lying to us over and over again, just so we can be "safe" or a way to "save" the world. Plus, now they have those big machines, like Alvin, who can dive down to the depth and look for those treasures. I don't understand why they need dolphins, or sea lions.

So repeat some of them maybe... =POh I gotta thank Arkon for my gallery, and for telling me I am a good artist :D I should have a new drawing(this time with a little color) tomorrow, I'm just finishing it...If you guys happen to look at my gallery I'd be happy to know what you think... just take it easy with me, I haven't drawn for a long time and just restarted last year, so don't expect to see much... ^_^;;

My apologies for my recent lack of updates and posts. Been busy working on my other 3 sites.   Anyway, I'm going to be doing some revamping of the site a bit later this week (the week of February 3rd.) I'll be running an image optimizer on all the images on the site to speed up load times for the more image-intensive pages such as the Levels listings, making headers for the page sections more uniform, fixing a few broken image tags, uploading more accurate info about the Ecco 2  version and correcting my mistakes in "About the Beta" that led from thinking it was a normal ROM.  :)I'll also be updating the Hacking section with the new info provided by Nemesis. (Thanks a ton, Nemesis!) And, I'll be uploading an IPS section containing patches to the ROM for various things (thanks to Tails151 for his awesome graphics patches), including a patch to allow access to more than just Level choices 1-18 in the Debug menu for anyone who doesn't want to hack it into the ROM themselves.BTW, if anyone can get that text translated, I'll post that too.

Yeah...but those of us who knew you Ankou also saw how stupid it was to have an avatar saying someone else's name...heheh! Or, at least I thought so anyway. Jader...wasn't she the one who always wanted to pick a fight? Perhaps that's why she liked your tough looking av... ;)

Tons of jumping. You have to jump forward, land on your tail, and jump when you hit the water. When you get close to the waterfall, jump up and over.

A while back someone (Miana, I beleive) pointed out that the Broken Machine Remix was posted on overclocked.org. I went there and happend to find another remix by a djpretzel. Its based on the Ecco 1 title and those who want to fill up their colections may be interested in hearing it.http://remix.overclocked.org/detailmix.php?mixid=OCR00003

heh tethys that aol guy rocks o_o;Eh...I'd love to take credit for that but I didn't make that one.  I only made the main characters.  And the house.Hey people!  Go take a look at the newest comic!  It's not as funny, but that's not the point.  We have transparant speech bubbles now!We didn't even have to worry about having Jason send me the comics so that I could add the speech bubbles.  Because now a friend of his sent him a copy of Photoshop 7.0, so he can make his own speech bubbles.And I'm jealous cuz I only have 5.5!Anyway, hopefully nobody will have any problems reading the text from now on.

<div id='container'>
Nah.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah. Jader. She was a bitch. Thought she was the shit or something, it seemed. Maybe Im crossing the line posting this, but I am pretty good with these kind of things.

<div id='container'>
_S is too l337 for such things. ^_^

<div id='container'>
I seem to remember arkonviox simply applying your avatar to jader, seing as how it fit her so well. ;)

<div id='container'>
That _S thing confused the hell outta me.....Hey Pho, nice comics.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So I finally have Photoshop(6.0, although I asked for the 7.0 but still..) but I don't know how to use it ^^;;I'd like to ask if anyone knows about a website explaining how to use it... CG, etc... the help that comes with the program just got me even more confused :? Some help please?? I beg....Anyway, thanks in advance

Dont forget about the skins, plenty of other looks for this site if your bored of it.I just had to second what Crestoe said! If any of you here haven't seen all the different skins available for this site, you're totally missin out! Crestoe has done some hella awesome ones that I don't think have been recognized the way they should (Crestoemrgreen:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well Phosis, you sure as heck aren't crossin any line with me with yer post... ;)And Alastor...now that you mention it, I think you're right! I do seem to remember something along those lines...heh!
</div>

<div id='container'>
Sorry this is so incredibly late, but welcome to the site! I've been a long time member, but haven't been around much as of late...hoping to change that. Anyway, just had to say it's always awesome to see a fellow X-Files fan... ;)

<br />
<div id='container'>
Hehe seems like only my type of people like my avatar... Jader... Rings a bell.. Somehow  o Didn't she even WONDER why her avatar said "Ankou" on it?!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
--- The truth is out there---*does the whistling sound from the beginning of X-Files*That's about all I remember of X-Files really... A guy named Maulder (sp?) and a gal named Scully... Which OBVIOUSLY shared a depp affection for eachother but never admitted it. Oh yeah and heads in pickles jars and flying saucers and aliens... O_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Maybe because making such complex machines is expensive... And the poor little dolphins and sea lions want only food?!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ha ha! Hooray... XD Keep 'em comin', Pho!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't think it had the "Ankou" part on it. Arkon probably edited that part out of the original or something, if it was him that gave it to Jader.And Pho, you are so not crossing any lines with me. o_o *runs*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, I read 'em, too! ^^; Ha... Vortex love dolphins. XD An interesting theory about the Vortex, though!

*nods approvingly* There! Those transparent text bubbles make the text easy to read, and, since they're transparent, don't obstruct the view of any of the background or characters.

Nyar, I fooled you all. o_o Not a new CG, but my new character for the Sonic the Hedgehog universe. KandyHer name is Kandy. She's a fox-dog. She has a Chao named Korn (har har, Kandy and Korn. X_x); I'm still trying to get a decent color scheme for Korn, though.

Dolphins used to help out the navy by detecting hidden mines in the persian gulf.Yanno...I just finished reading an old fiction book called Venus Among the Fishes. (Great book, go and read it. o_o) Eventually, Coral, the main character, gets captured by humans. After she is forced to perform in shows, she goes on to do work for the Navy. Of course, when I read the book the first time I didn't even pick up on that, but when I read it again just now, it made me think of this topic.

Hey, there ya are, Epi! Was wondering where you had gotten to. Glad to see you back! ^_^ Can't wait for the new updates!

please tell me, is my "grammer" that bad, you don't know how much I fear for my sanity.just because I type, think and read somthing like"the cat ran up the tree"that means nothing, because "I didn't"it "was""fausk euht tree eh up dog"or somthing like that.get off the damn pot folks or else.I get dozens telling me they don't understand.you don't know how much it hurts, I question my own reality, now even using a spell check (with EZ board)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i gave it a thought, to write a humor themed one, but seeing as how all my "writing skills" are worse than a retarted 2 year old I might not."if you are aquaphobic then ecco the dolphin is a game not for you!  Unlike many games, in ecco when you "touch water" you don't die, few vidio games allow you to swim, dolphins are great at this, it's just up to the player to how well they make our little dolphin swim.and then there is more.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Unlike many games, in ecco when you "touch water" you don't die.Actually, I think Ecco was ground breaking in that area.I've thought about writing a review for Ecco, but beyond "Ecco is fun, play it" I don't know what else to write.

<div id='container'>
I agree with phosis, I rarely do get anything that you ramble about. Including this post.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Eao, your gammer and spelling hasn't been much worse than several others on the board. When I find myself lost in one of your posts I think it is because you don't link together your ideas very clearly. Given a little thought, the connections can be made. Here's what I'm talking about, in this post you have the phrase:that means nothing, because "I didn't" it "was"By spacing above and bellow this passage, to me, represents of change in subject. However that is obviously not the case. I can see how this can be done by accident. I can also see reasons why it would be done on purpose. I think this is part of the confussion.

It wont go to waste buddy, i'll have more artwork in the later weeks.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Wow, thats incredibly beautiful Crestoe. The only thing that bugged me about it before was the tail, and how thin it got before the winged flukes where, but then I remembered - "we're not dealing with a normal dolphin here". The spines along the back are done wonderfully - the translucent effect worked well here, and those pectoral fins *drools* Love how they came out. Good work Crest. ^^ Nice to see your back in the art game with your new scanner.
</div>

That is pretty.About time you put up some new artwork, I was wondering when you would do so.

The navy seem that they use anything they have to figure out the other side. Dolphins and sea lions are just some of the animals and things they use to figure things out. It seems that we may wipe out a few speicies because the Navy needs them.

thats Arkonviox in his second form. For those of you guys who didn't hear right.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That looks awsome Crest! The colors are really beautiful. :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Cally: The tail becomes more serpant like as old world atlanteans evolve. With Arkonviox, his evoulution of his looks are based on how powerful he is. He has 3 forms. Arkonviox 1 is his begining look, Still very dolphin although he has a neck and a bit of an upper body like a human, although his fins are still very fin like, but with a bend like a human arm. The second form, which is in this pic, shows him with more of an upper body with muscles and a strong shoulders. His armor now creates a controlled energy blade called a lavis, which although very beautiful is a very deadly weapon. His mask his now silver and resembles a bull. His skin is no longer tan and is now a bluish gray and his eyes are blue instead of red.Arkonviox 3 resembles a human/dolphin/mermaid like qualities. He no longer has his fins, now with broad musular arms and the return of some of his original colors, red eyes, golden mask and tan skin. His Armor is gone and is now a fork like staff which is primary weapon.  His neck is now more visible and his head is still very dolphin, sitting upon a human like body. Arkonviox 3 is what the old world atlanteans would have become in the future had not their race been claimed by the vortex.New world atlanteans are the thirians which is what Thelsa Crestoe is, although they do not resemble their distant cousins.This is all in our story though, but that basicly explains his many forms. I wanted the races to be very much less dolphin but are still in their family of orgin. Normal bores me, i like to create my own original ideas then follow how thier supposed to be.

Wait... I thought I had replied to this already. Weird... Oh, ok, I HAD.Anyway, I said that the only way I could learn photoshop is getting it in the first place! Or was there a way I could use it without having it?... :?  Uh, I don't know about that, so, I wanted to get photoshop because I wanted to learn to use it. Get it?=P I think I'm doing ok, but what I'm doing has nothing to do with Ecco so I can't post it here...

you got alot of potential. your very good with a pencil. i think what would help is even more detail. you have alot in those pictures but seeing even more detait is something i'd like to see from you. probably cause im confident the results will be astonding.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, wow, how beautiful, Niki!! ^_^ No, really! Arkon is right. I just love your stuff! I think my favorite is the one that you said was your first attempt at a dolphin - even though you said it doesn't really look like a dolphin, I think it does, and I think it's very cute! Keep it up! ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I only know what I learned from Computer Graphics and from what I self-taught myself. And I still like PSP better. &gt;:p Besides, PhotoShop doesn't have an Animation Studio, which I also find useful for when I wanna make animated GIFs.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ATOLM! Okee, since it is my day off today, I coloured your picture! I finished it!! ^_____^ But my scanner is still busted. Would you like me to mail it to you?? (Sorry it took so long!!!! ;___;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks, Teth!!  mrgreen:And I have faith that you won't copy mine and Jason's comic like someone else tried to do. .; (nobody here, and probably nobody anybody here knows)But, yeah, that would be cool!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ech, I hate people like that! &gt;_&lt; It's bad enough that they do it with artwork, but sprite comics too? Anyway, another CG for you all! This one's of my sister's character in chibi form. He's an angel, by the way.http://sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/art/cg/hp/ChibiGobi.pngI'm currently working on a CG right this minute, so I'll stick that one up here too when I'm done with it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sure Nori. I'll send you my address in Pm. ^^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
And here's the new CG. It's James Potter. Eee. I love him. ^^ My favorite characters from Harry Potter are James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black; they're just too cool! In this pic, James is probably about 15 ot 16. And his wand is actually my wand that my sister got for me for Christmas this year.http://sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/art/cg/hp/JamesPotter.png
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Buh? Yes, another new CG! I guess I had so much art to CG....it got all backed up. ._.;;; So I've just been CGing up a storm. Another one of my sister's Harry Potter characters, a mysterious young first year Slytherin girl named Aria.http://sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/art/cg/hp/Aria.png

<br />
<div id='container'>
Well now! I haven't had much time to reply to things lately...and I bet I'm much too late for this topic but hey, it's the thought that counts. Best of luck, Dreadlord! And. Stuff.  :D

I'll pray for you, DL (good luck.. hope it goes well).

As well as can be expected Kitnee. I was gone long because I was "in for repairs" shall we say. There is nothing they can do for my coval cords though and I'll never speak again. Though there are many other ways to comunicate so it doesnt matter in the long run. I am just surprized that SO much has happened since I was away! Heh!

Trellius...  ...it seems like it's been forever since I last saw you! I guess between us both (mainly me probably) being gone for periods of time, it's not surprising. Anyway...I was saddened to read your last reply... cry: ...will a hug bring a smile to your face? *hugs you anyway* Well...take care, and hopefully I'll be seeing you around more, eh!?

More acurately, the throght (hope thats right, I am still suffering from spellingshytis!  ) Our neighbor's son wanted to commit suicide. He stole his mom's revolver and was outside on his knees when we found him. I tried to talk some sense while the others called the authorities but he panicked when they arrived and put the gun to his head. With no other option I tried to grab it away but it went off and piercing my... larnax i think its called(?) and destroying my voice box. He's alright now, and is recieving help. I am lucky too and despite what anyone says it is my God that saved me that day. But enough of that, what's done is done eh?

I feel the same way. This was the first forum I ever really got into and established myself. I remember once, a long time ago now it seems, that I left for like 3 months.

Weeeeelll...as some of you might have noticed, I haven't been around much lately. I've been caught up with school (started a new semester) and all sorts of crazy things. Ah, you know how it is. =D Just wanted to let all my good friends (and new friends) here at Arkon.com know what was up...um...yeah....well, I'll try to be around more. But until then-!Spoot.

<div id='container'>
Hey Noriko...  ...it sure is nice to see you again! As you know I too haven't been around anywhere near as much as I used to, but I still come from time to time.

What do you lot think about Ecco the dolpin roms?. Ever since my megadrive broke, I have been playing ecco I and ecco : tides of time on the pc in the form of roms. Do any of you play ecco roms?. I also have a ps2 so i play Ecco defender of the future there.I was also interested if anybody knew any ecco the dolphin roms hacking sites or anything similar.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
And the forum continues on with its daily routines......
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah Welcome to the forum! Make yourself at home here and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I guess if they ever make another or a new ecco the dolphin game, it will come out on Gamecube or PS2. Maybe you should check out the game charts and see if any ecco games are popping up.Maybe they make an ecco mega pack, like they did with sonic the hedgehog on the gamecube?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ecco hacking site? Epiccenter ran a site, in fact we have a little forum for it on the bottom here.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thx, I was interested because there seems to be a lot of sonic the hedgehog hacking sites and I never saw an ecco the dolphin hacking site. It would be interesting to be able to create your own level layout in an ecco the dolphin rom, like sonic the hedgehog, dont u think?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thnaks Nori! I'll send yours when I go to the post office!Distance doesnt matter to me really.My best bud lives in England and he will be receiving a 19 by 25 hand colored pic by me, it is for his birthday. =D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Anyone of you ever found an ecco 2 alpha rom?. That might help people understand the beta version better.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
"Spoot" was my word of wisdom I gave to my brother's friend. We call him Silas.Well, there is only one thing I have to say about cramped school schedules and that is survive. Survive to live another day. And until you get more time, I've got this guy (  ) sealed in a plastic bag in the bottom of my closet.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
sure this is irrelevant, but thats why it's the offtopic forum.I was looking at a map, and noticed Cuba kind of looked like a dolphin.  so for you fan fiction writers, if you think It's "good" you can have the sea animals call Cuba, "dolphin island"(because dolphins don't have anything to do with human politics)does anyone else think countries look like animals, or objects?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
School can be such a pain, but there is the upcoming summer... *waits patiently*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I just wanted to ask, how many people of you actually use hex editors to hack into ecco the dolphin games? If you do, where could i find any good tutorials?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes, welcome and stick around.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I've met a couple of people hacking it for themselves, not sure where to find them though. I play the original Eccos with Roms because I never had many games for my sega. I remembered playing Ecco a few times so I got the roms. The most hacking I do is taking screenshots for sprite comics.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I did not notice it untill now but ths is the first time in about a year that we have an "Ecco" persona here. wink:
</div>

I noticed while I was young that New York looks like a dog's head. And Spain looks like a helmet with Portugal as a face. These are signs of too many map assignments.

<div id='container'>
Thanks guys. =D Yea, weekends are when I get to use the computer (most of the time) so here I am! Don't worry, I'm not leaving. I don't want to make Crest sad, now do I? Oh yes, spoot. Many ask the origins of spoot, but...all I can say is 'Angry Beavers'. Muahahahahaha!

Anyone here know anything about why Appaloosa's site hasn't worked for a good while now? I'm sure hoping they're not going out of business or anything like that... :(
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The version documented on this site really IS an alpha version. I would have used the term "alpha", but, Histronic's site used the term Beta to begin with. Changing the name would've caused unnecessary confusion, and caused people searching Google for the Ecco 2 Beta site to end up at the old one, not the new one.An alpha game is partly complete, and usually ridden with bugs. A beta is complete, but needs to have bugs ironed out, still. So, anything earlier than this is a "Pre-Alpha".To answer your question, no, no other pre-release versions have yet been found.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yep, once I muster the interest to get back to work on it. I've got some other projects I've been busy with, including a huge Game Secrets / Sonic Secrets / Ecco 2 Alpha / Arcade Gaming / Game Hardware / Reviews, etc. site I call Epic Gaming. Right now it's still getting off the ground, but it's located at//epicenter.2ya.com/gaming/. It'll be http//sonicepicenter.2ya.com), will all be linked together as one giant site. )

Heh. Not so. Just need to fix some issues with the server before I can roll out the updates.

I could be wrong but I do not think so DG, for me it works on and off so I'm guessing it's just a bit of server or network trouble. Guessing mind you.  :P

Ahhhh....home. XD
</div>
<br />

as i said before we think they went out of business or downsized. ecco dof probably made them some money but if you think about it what other "hit" games has appaloosa made? I think the era of Appaloosa is over.

<div id='container'>
Hmmm.... a little close to home for me.... Im not shure I approve. :?

An od, but refreshing way to look at it, since it has always been excepted as looking like a boot.

we do rom hacking on this site. and epicenter has a site dedicated to that also. http://ecco2beta.2ya.com/there was a plan to alter the levels of the game. someone had posted instructions on how to go about that not too long ago.right now epicenters been taking a break to pursue other projects so thats why he hasn't been around. (yes i got on him about it.)right now the best rom i reccomend it the ecco the dolphin sega cd iso with its mp3 collection.

Well now......that is a tad on the spooky side.....
</div>

<div id='container'>
o.o; Great now I'll never be able to get that out of my head as I sit in history class and we discuss florida. Thank you arkonviox.com!

<div id='container'>
All good people bow your heads, let us have a moment of silence for the great Apaloosa... 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
&gt;.&gt;What are you talking about?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I can't believe I missed this... a new couple!! Awww! Atolm, now you have another picture to draw... and I wanna see that Sten and Arkon pic!  Btw, welcome Ecco! I'm new too, kind of...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah that was me. I still like, yet a friend has my CD that it's on and I haven't gotten it back yet. --; Oh well, at least he's recording me some songs as well. *starts singing One-Winged Angel* Also, on the same overclocked site, there is a Castlevania remix of Bloody Tears, it's titled Bloody Hell, and is currently one of my favorites. ^-^ Guitar solos rock!

I am not sure to draw Trellius and Miana or Trellius and Boo.  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I intend to. Avaiability and monatary resorces are my ony enamy.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I love the music to Castlevania. In particualr I like The Lost Painting...So freaken pretty.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I love Castlevania's music. Espiecially vampire slayer, that's a good one, and Wicked Child is another good one. Heart of Fire is really good too, Rainbow Cemetary's pretty too if you don't mind the name... *snickering*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
although Arkon.com is for more serious ecco games (it seems)should Ecco jr//search.findsall.info/apps/eps/eps.cgi?cid=newn6CPZ&amp;dp_lp=16&amp;dp_p4pid=oingo_inclusion_xml_19&amp;dp_format=1.3&amp;s=ebay&amp;nnreq=277fb47763dafcf4634a3dda860b2271long link, but this copy is at 8 bucks, another lot is at 30!.

Well if I was to draw it, it would be what? an hourglass dolphin, a freaky hamster and you Miana? What do you want to be drawn as?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, Miana has two forms. Her real form is a woman with ankle-length silvery blue hair, her eyes are like the Chobits style only black on top than fading to baby blue. Her dolphin form is white with inverted constellation of dolphinus on forhead. That help?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Indeed.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh my God
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Bleh. they didnt produce shit. if it wasnt for ED, we wouldnt have anything, and he isnt even with them. I wont miss Apaloosa. They were just another crap company, like all the dumb asses at THQ. So what if they made DC ecco? It was a piece of crap too, and if it wasnt an ecco game...if it was like...the same game with flipper in its place, half of you wouldnt have anything to complain about. Lets face it, it was, and is, crap. Someone else will pick up ecco, because it is a money making franchise. and if they dont, it doesnt matter. Ecco in 3D has proven to be utter shit.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Cally if your going to come in here and tell us that Italy doesnt look like a boot, then I just dont know what I am going to do with you. Italy looks more like a boot then boots look like a boot.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Terrible. dance Dance revolution is a fad that wont fucking die. Half the people that play it couldnt dance worth shit in real life, without the pads. Not that I care or anything. I hate dancing. Why? Because it is fun, and I hate fun things.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
phosis. enough of the bad mouthing.to tell the truth though appaloosa hasnt made any good games besides ecco. and ed annuziatta who created ecco hasnt had any great projects himself. tiny tank seems kinda wussy. chakan seems kinda done already. small ball baseball lacks lawyers and high paychecks that make baseball cool. both of them are blinded by what has the most potential. online gaming and ultra violence. combiend those two elements into a story like ecco with puzzles and mysterioy you have the ultimate game.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
eao. worset game ever. o_o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hey my signture was thrown back in time too. dammit.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Thank God for school, homework, work, school on saturdays, tests, bad tv shows, bad games, and stress. YAY!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Apparently the Squirrel bot is now outdtaed.They have been fused with puppies and become these strange squirrel-puppies....I sincerly wonder how I will draw this...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I like some of the music to the games. Although you wouldn't catch me out in public, I do play it. Why? I need the excercise...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow the squirrel rocks o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Some people can really get into that game though.One boy used it in his report and demonstrated the game in hard mode.Problem was that it was on the second floor of the class room and he pratically made the room shake.the other classes complained too.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No more jogging bear??awww
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well...Yeah. You have to have the ultraviolence.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ohmy God? What?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Probably because of the relation between two dolphins and a hamster. ;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i thought it was a squarrel.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ecco 2 beta o_o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have a squirrel robot if that helps.The space hamster belongs to Trellius.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
whats the difference o_o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's a love triangle =P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
One has many robotic parts and a fluffly tail.The other one seems to like fresh wood shavings. ^^;;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Terrible.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Bring back the jogging bear
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm finding this very amusing.... *snickers*And Miana's only a dolphin when she morphs, she's a human in actuality.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ooooooook....this has the potential to get ugly... 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heehee... now that you mention it....  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So eh..... what do you have in mind for this picture then At? 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, Trellius can't wait any longer to see it...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I am more frightend than flattered........ 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes! Boo's fur is standing on end in anticipation of it!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I love Castlevania's music. Espiecially vampire slayer, that's a good one, and Wicked Child is another good one. Heart of Fire is really good too, Rainbow Cemetary's pretty too if you don't mind the name... *snickering*Yes-yes! Castlevania rules. It was Castlevania1 that got me started playing games at all!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Pho.......say it isnt so.......   
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sad but true...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You are the one that wanted all three Trellius. =P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey look, a name even more so original than mine! heheh... oh, welcome o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
no ones name is more then original then yours o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
o.oYou have a weird relationship with Boo, Trellius, no offence =P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You'll eventually get use to this place and its people. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Atolm said that it was nice to see so much love in the forum. Then Noriko said:No. It makes me lonely.And Kitnee agrees.I wanted to say that I share your pain. =P Look at my sig. Pathetic.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
haha, yea..I guess your right arkon c.c
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Cally if your going to come in here and tell us that Italy doesnt look like a boot, then I just dont know what I am going to do with you. Italy looks more like a boot then boots look like a boot.To me, it looks both like Boot and Hammer-Head.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
  really, Ati?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*kicks Pho inda... jewels* no talkin' tah me like that 0o;; I see it as a hammerhead, other people see it as a boot, freedom of imagination m'dear :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That remix is ye-olde ancient. I've had it on my HD for a few odd years. DJ Pretzel is a really nice guy, owner of Overclocked remix.  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Dang Ep! Where did you get all this know-how? What know-how are you referring to?  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
heh...arkon you fool...you actually used that picture? what did you say to me when i showed it to you? "Thats lame Phosis". Whos lame now, you lame lamer? Never give me photoshop again. It means your doom -_-;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
In that case...it looks like Alastor. No...It looks like Alastor if I had ran him over with a train repeatedly, to make him shaped like a boot.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
They had it at laser quest...but it was the "Mickey mouse" DDR. I tried to play it. The asian guy kicked my ass at it. So I called him "A fucking dick" And ran away.Funny how that game works.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
eh...o_o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Uh...wha.......I havnt been THIS speachless since.......hmmm.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I know. its terrible. But dont worry Al. These threats are empty....I dont own a train.......(Yet....)

o_o Great.

Im going to buy a megadrive, the problem is that i cant find any more ecco the dolphin games for it. I used to have a megadrive, but that went all to my cousin and he broke the megadrive and lost the games   Another problem is that I live in europe and they use PAL version games, which seem to be 10mhz slower than american ones. I wanted to buy a second hand ecco the dolphin game via amazon.co.uk but they only lead to second hand american shops. Do american games work on the european console? It's called genesis there, so just tell me if you think it could work. Im only buying this second hand megadrive cause of ecco the dolphin and all the sonic games. thx
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well if there ever is anymore work done on working out the level design, sprites and colour tablettes, (Im terrible with a hex editor, I only blast hack and that crashes the game) tell me please ;). Because it would be interesting if new ecco the dolphin games start appearing, and new levels that people have not played anymore.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
pho... seems to be correct, ecco (talking about tides of time) was way better than the defender of the future game, that really does suck bad   Its not like i dont like Ecco !. I like it a lot, its just I think ecco should go back to good old 2d ;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
there we go.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Can anyone give me tips for the level  The tube of medusa
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
fraid not....It would look all fucked on your tv, because NTSC games give a different signal then PAL...but you might be able to find an NTSC to PAL converter chip...though I doubt for such an old system...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes...Pray to God. Thats all I have to say.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
er, u got any better advice  :P ?

been a while since i posted art. anyway, explanation is that, in my opinion, final fantasy character designs are SO cluttered and over the top. not all of them of course but a lot. so i wanted to do something like that...i wanted to make a character with a hodge podge of make no sense accesories. theres a lotta flaws but i dun care. the feather is a weapon. ultra paper cut of doooom!http://vantid.dolphinparadise.net/featherwarrior.jpg

Why am I not surprised. ^.^

Scotty, if you plan on beaming me up, now would be a good time.... :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Uhm, Sky Tides? Wait, lemme remember. It's been awhile since I played it.Okay, I suggest you would be in the slow moving phase of it.  When you swim to the first fork, go right, keep swimming until the long gap passes by and then jump over to the left. Wait until the long gap on the right ends than jump back over. The screen will start to move diagonally upwards, and the the two tubes will merge into one. Now it'll level off and there are moving holes that'll make you fall from the level back to Sky way. You can sonar them, they'll close for a few seconds and it should give you time to get past. Just try to stay on the brown gelatonous thing and you'll be fine.As for 'Tubes of Medusa' my best advice is to have patience and hual ass with much-ness. That Medusa is fast. It was also very amusing to watch my brother try to be it. *snickers*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yep. The only thing you really need to know is that we're all crazy in one way or another. &gt;:p

Very beautiful Vanvan, I must draw your chara :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually Pho-Pho, NTSC doesn't run AT ALL on a pal console, you need a converter (which looks just like another cart, with two ports to plug in). All I can think of you doing is something like going onto E-Bay, and search for PAL versions of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco Tides of Time, and although you have to bid for them they're really good.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, Miana covered it the most, the best thing to do about the whirlpools is to constantly use your sonar when in those areas so that they can't get you.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah. What she said.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
umm. o_o whoa.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
good job al. your an idiot.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
dont listen to phosis. he's bald and canadian and you cant put your thoughts on weather to trust a guy like that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
artreus. i hate to say this but no one from caverns of hope has dwelved into text editing like the people we got here. we got epicenter, nemesis (who descovered alot about the levels.) and tails (whs learned about the sprites and has become an expert.) they all come from the sonic hacking community. which means we got the best hacking team on the net. problem is they are busy people. if i can muster up an interest perhalps we can get them to work harder. i have an idea but havent had a chance to implement it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
alastor i officialy hate you. your dumber then wood. your as smart as a brick.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
o_O;trelluis i egerly await your every demise.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i posted this a month ago.epicenter. im planning a possible hack of ecco where Arkonviox is the main character and all the characters in ecco say things different to get a different storyline. since the world of ecco is near dead we need to come up with soemthing. and my game idea isnt gonna happy until this sites complete. so a cheap hack with changes might hold em up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
why not just emulate it?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow.soemthing about his face reminds me of arkon. i cant quite pin point it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
oooooh..... now, that's what I call "a pic"... nice one with a feather. Awsome...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
that's what I do all the time... do what Cally says, Ecco. Even the level after "Tube of Medusa" (HARD MODE only).
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
good point there Ark.fraid not....It would look all fucked on your tv, because NTSC games give a different signal then PAL...but you might be able to find an NTSC to PAL converter chip...though I doubt for such an old system...I once found, uhm... "PAL-NTSC-SECAM" Converter Cartridge (with Lock-On feature) at the local store very recently but, the thing is that I so much regret for not buying it...  ? and, when I came back to that same store couple of days later, I discovered it was gone.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hahahah...  ...well, I can assure I won't! I think it's about time ya shut yer cake hole there Phosis...about doggin on Defender of the Future! I'll have you know, it was the first Ecco game that I played...so if it weren't for that...I would be totally missing out on the awesome series! Defender happens to be my favorite all time game...  ...so... *shoves a piece of cake in his mouth* ...there! ;) ...nah, I suppose it is your opinion, and you have a right to it...it's just...you can't expect me to just sit on my ass and not defend, Defender...haha...  ...no pun intended! Anyway, I just had to chime in with Kitnee too...and say that I also liked it... :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh yes, thanks for reminding me, -TUBE OF MEDUSA- is a nasty level, swim hard, swim fast, and if she catches you, constantly sonar and try to hit her in the underside and she'll release you, but kepp swimming!.  If your fast enough at the start, even in hard mode - she will retreat ^^
</div>

Oh my God.  It's ok, I'm no different, you just don't know me yet. Or maybe it's because my crazyness is too complex to explain in the forum. And in my second language. And I don't think its a good idea to scare you all away.Whatever. =P

 It's called genesis there, so just tell me if you think it could work. Im only buying this second hand megadrive cause of ecco the dolphin and all the sonic games.If I could, I'd send my Genesis. I just found it in a closet and I emulate Ecco anyway.Actually, can you buy a genesis and Ecco for that? It can't be worth much anymore. Or maybe not, a few years ago Sega began selling it again as Sega Core, or Genesis core, or something. And there may be compatabilty problems, I don't know if in Europe it needs to work different or not.

&gt;:p I think what was terribly ironic about it was the fact that I started liking BSSM when I was flipping through the channels and it came on; I was at my grandmother's old house. What's ironic is that my grandfather, her husband, was in World War II at the bombing of Pearl Harbor; he watched all his freinds die, and so he hated the Japanese from then on. I think he'd like, disown me or something if he was still alive and knew that I loved Japan and stuff. o_O;;

Ruined Snow Penis Stimulates Debate By HANA R. ALBERTS Crimson Staff Writer When a few members of the Harvard crew team decided to build a snowy representation of the male anatomy on Feb. 11, they never imagined it would be so hard to keep it up. The 9-foot snow phallus, constructed in Tercentenary Theater, was torn down just hours after its erection. But its impression still sparked an intense debate, from dining halls to dorm rooms, over the appropriateness of public displays of genitalia. Even The Economist magazine weighed in on the discussion, offering the destruction of the sculpture as evidence of American prudishness on its usually staid pages. But women&amp;#8217;s groups on campus have led a chorus of complaints against the snow penis, arguing that such a display is demeaning to women. &amp;#8220;It was offensive because it was pornographic,&amp;#8221; said Amy E. Keel &amp;#8217;04, who said she and her roommate &amp;#8220;dismantled&amp;#8221; the giant snow penis. &amp;#8220;As a feminist, pornography is degrading to women and creates a violent atmosphere,&amp;#8221; she said. Keel said that her personal experience as a rape survivor makes this statue even more uncomfortable to observe. &amp;#8220;Men think they have the right to force that on you,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a logical extension.&amp;#8221; Furthermore, Keel claims that she and her roommate were verbally and physically harassed by a group of roughly 25 men when they attempted to tear down the statue with a cardboard tube at 115 p.m.,&amp;#8221; Spey said. &amp;#8220;We had morning practice, and if guys are out there that late I&amp;#8217;d be pissed. That&amp;#8217;s why we did it so early.&amp;#8221; But regardless of the alleged circumstances surrounding the snow penis&amp;#8217; downfall, a controversy over the meaning of the statue lingers. Women&amp;#8217;s Studies Lecturer Diane L. Rosenfeld, who teaches Women, Violence and the Law this semester, said that the implications of the snow phallus go beyond the legitimacy of the statue&amp;#8217;s presence. &amp;#8220;The ice sculpture was erected in a public space, one that should be free from menacing reminders of women&amp;#8217;s sexual vulnerability,&amp;#8221; Rosenfeld wrote in an e-mail yesterday. She said the snow penis follows a long line of public phallic symbols, including the Washington Monument and missiles. &amp;#8220;Women do not need to be reminded of the power of the symbol of the male genitalia,&amp;#8221; Rosenfeld said. &amp;#8220;My guess is that they are constantly reminded of it in daily messages.&amp;#8221; A discussion about feminist perspectives on the statue, sponsored by the Radcliffe Union of Students, will take place Tuesday night in the Adams House small dining room. But the makers of the statue said they intended to build the snow penis as a simple joke. Skey said he came up with the idea to allow a few members of the team to &amp;#8220;hang out together&amp;#8221; outside of practice. &amp;#8220;We built it for fun, instead of building a snowman,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;We built it specifically as a junior high prank.&amp;#8221; Skey said he never expected such national attention&amp;#8212;or such heated opposition. &amp;#8220;Once it turned around into a huge sexism debate, it was like a giant keg of gunpowder waiting for a spark,&amp;#8221; Skey said. In spite of Skey&amp;#8217;s intentions, Keel said she was offended by the joke. &amp;#8220;I have a right to speak out against the joke,&amp;#8221; Keel said. &amp;#8220;I criticize the motives of putting it up, but since they did, it is within my rights to put it down. It goes both ways.&amp;#8221; Skey said he agreed Keel did not do anything wrong by knocking down the statue. &amp;#8220;If people found it obscene, they had a right to rip it down,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s perfectly true.&amp;#8221; But Skey said he thinks that at a school like Harvard, jokes can be blown out of proportion. &amp;#8220;Smart kids overanalyze things,&amp;#8221; he said. ***Y'know, sometimes I hate my gender....

Haaaaa, Megadrive...My first console (a Megadrive II, to be more precise)...The best 2D console ever...My first love...  the first is for America, Canada, Asia, etc. and the second is for Europe.You can buy NTSC games on Internet and use a converter.But you can also try to find European games for Megadrive in some shops which sell "old" games.You can also send an announcement in the newspaper to find a guy who will accept to sell you some games; but in this case, the person can try to sell the games to an expensive price, so, be careful.Same thing for the second hand.

I am glad you all like it.There will be a big update to my gallery soon, I have found some old artwork of dolphins that I did way before I came to this place. It pays to look in the closet once and awhile.It includes dolphins in gold armor to strange almost decaying whale beasts.And yes, there is Ecco fan art included in this pile.My scanner is still giving me troubles but I hope to fix this by tonight.

I havent been here for even a year yet...

Anyways, despite Trellius strange behavior in this thread (I sincerly hope you are not against me sending my art to my friend in England!) I received your package Nori.

Well, I'm a pod member. What comes after me?I believe 'Pod Sentinel.' To my knowledge, Eao's the only one who actually managed to hold the rank before the forum was reset. But then the 'Earth Clan' rank came along and covered most of the high posters not already Exalted Ones. Or, in Shadow's case, Ex Infernis. How much useless information do I have floating around?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Er, I fail to understand any of this. A penis is just another part of mamilian anatomy. A statue of it is well, just a statue. I could go into some sort of maddox type rant here but I won't because I don't care enough. Just rember, all the posts in this message are the results of penis.

Well, the Earth Clan was actually a select group of people, not based on rank, but on certain qualifications.

Hmmmm. I believe aformal appologie is in order.I read through the strip amidst other text and documents, saw a mention of Bible and shit and misinterperated it.My humblist appologies, I had com across so much blasphemus crap lately that I guess I automattically counted it to be such without thinking or reading carefully.I AM sorry for causing upset and confusion, and appologize for it.A misunderstanding on my part. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Er, I fail to understand any of this. A penis is just another part of mamilian anatomy. A statue of it is well, just a statue. Heh. In a broader sense you are correct Shadow, though you must understand that it is simple ethicate to generally keep such talk (or actions like the building of the penis statue) out of the public eye. (ooooh that was a cue for a good punn which I will not take up  )I could go into some sort of maddox type rant here but I won't because I don't care enough. Just rember, all the posts in this message are the results of penis.That I noticed now also!    So far it HAS been the center of discusion here! 
</div>

<div id='container'>
Yeah. My turn to make a mistake and bend over eh?  This is just to direct everyone who was present at the Art trading thread (should be just below this one or at the verry top) attention back to it. I;m sorry for stepping on some toes, Crestoe, but please do read more there.Thanx.

*snickering* I found it amusing to say the least. A friend of mine told me that if it was built in front of her college (She goes to an art school) They'd start critiqing it on how antatomically correct it is, stylisation, and medium of it. Than she went and said someone would buld a snow-quim to keep the snow-wang company, and than someone else would build a snow-arse incase the snow-wang swung that way...Than she states that no one there is sane anyway.... ^^;

In some forums they have both. A rank above the avatar and personal text under it.it wouldnt be hard to add a text qoute into the forum. but the only reason why i might not do it is cause if i got to upgrade the forum my changes will be removed.

it can't be helped.if you learn and read.....youll see that things aren'twell..'good'(art history is fun.....too bad the "woman's Holocost" stated because the invention of some "Mary"  couldn't help the peole..so the church invented somthng else....the 'witch'"

(nothing is happning at Arkonviox.com, so I think one of these is needed please ignore/forgive any spelling misstakes) the sun rises on the ocean, hues of pink, green, purple dance with the blue of the sky reflected off the water.  Under the pallet of beauty more colors go about yet another eternal dance.  Sliver fish flash and fade into the darkness, the coral reef life is like a living rainbow.all is peacefull, ecept if you are a fish, for soon death, loss and sorrow is about to rise along with the accending sun.  The dolphins are hunting.Kahujo, Lunahow, Ejay, Onolo, Loki, Taguwai star to round up the little beauties, the fish start to panic...but with safty in numbers some 'mean' fish are calmer than other.  "better off him than me" is the creed.but, the hunter is hunted...nothing is scacred in the paradise...-----now you go!

I remember a time when the Undercaves did not  exist. I hdd the internet back then... you only get Ecco sites that were one  page long....How surprised I was that when I came back that there was a community going on. ^^

Heres ho0w the ranking system works.when you first join your an outcast.then once you hit 50 posts your a transient.150 posts you become a pod member. 500 posts your a sentinel. 1000 posts you become a pod elder. 2000 posts you become a pod god.a pod enforder is a moderator then an exaulted one is an admin. there are 4 admins on this site. Dolphin, Phosis I and Crestoe.

Well, you were definately a transient and I don't remember many people working up to sentinel. So, I guess you made it up to Pod Member.

Its not so bad. That's what I've been doing. It lets me take screenshots :)  That, and I wouldn't expect my Sega to work anymore anyway.

In order to play Ecco DotF I'll have to buy a NTSC-PAL converter.. Or I'll take the DC to someone who can do that directly on it(if that's really possible).It's not bad at all using emulator, it's free =) My megadrive haven't been seen in ages... it's completely ruined... I loved it

<div id='container'>
Well I suppose that IS true....every colt has to stat somewhere...

Luckily there are emulaters for everything nowdays. I got them all almost.

*Looks at Eao*I blame television.

<div id='container'>
I agree with Trell; great job! *finup*

<div id='container'>
And besides...emulators have save states! So you can svae your game at any point and return to it later on.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Also cool yes, the only thing is you need to have a PC that can handle the accelleration

this sites bad enough as it is. bringing kids here would make it worse.

<br />
<div id='container'>
cause eao...did you see how exausted my join the story post was? i think people are worn out by those.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah. Take a look at Stenella (not to be confused with my good friend Stenellya) and Jader. o_o *runs*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I see nothing wrong about age difference.*Thinks for a moment*What is wrong with Stenella Kit?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Nothing wrong with emulation or anything but I really dislike playing with a keyboard...Gah.... must buy control pad soon....I just downloaded GENS and now I can play my sega CD games again. ^__^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*agrees with Atolm*Plus Stenella seems much older, when I met her I thought she was my age or older.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have nothing against stenella. But jader needs to stay gone.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Pay no attention to me , Trellius ;). I'm bragging. shocklol)

Again, Trellia and I where the only public members to get over 1000 posts, then the forum got deleted. ^^; And I will join your story soon Eao..

This'll be fun :)***but, the hunter is hunted...nothing is scacred in the paradise... for the oceans hold great, terrible dangers, small, large, unthinkable. Although, luck would befall the creatures of the reef, with most of the sharp-tooth fish only hunting at the time of the dark, when the moon was high and the water black. However, all of these thoughs where not affecting the small hunting group of dolphins, they had their catch before their eyes. The fish darted in and out of coral crevases and the sand below, determined to not be a part of todays catch. Kahujo, Ejay and Loki sonared down along the sand, their beaks gazing against the rough sand, searching and searching. Kahujo let out a squeal of delight as a fish squirmed about in the sand as his sonar reflected from its scales. As quick as a flash Kahujo drove his beak into the sand, his jaws wrapping around the smooth body of the fish, pulling its frail body from the sand. Soon they where all feasting on a fresh catch, singing songs of praise to dolphinia in the sky for their feed, in this paradise, all can be sacred, only if they try to be...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I dunno. Stenella seemed...I dunno. Too juvenile, or something. Maybe it was the way she annoyingly used "U" as a word.    Just something about her kinda irked me. o_O
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
COH got to her.and I didn't want babies coming here.  I ment...they'll be ecco-intergrated.like training a 4 year old the tuba...so when it's 20 it's a tuba master!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Stenella? *shudders* At least jader was more fun. ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
this sounds funny as hell but.i might promote my site in black/rapper sites. just to see the results. this site has everything except a token black guy.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow i have to say im looknig forward to it ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What the hell did that have to do with this topic ._.;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
...I still think Stenella doesn't appear to be 12. Damn, my brother's 12 and he wishes he had any idea on how to create a website... while Sten has one, which happens to be a very good one. And I wish when I was 12 I was half as smart as she is... wait. I'm feeling old. o.o;Never met Jader though
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Never met  this Jader either, but from what I heard I think I should be glad no?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I made my first website when I was 10, I think I still have the HTMl somewhere.. people don't believe that i'm 14 0o;back to the topic, I have to agree with you Eao, it is introducing the younger generations to Ecco. Tis wonderful ^_^ I was 12 when I got Ecco Jr. for the Mega Drive, I actually quite liked it, sure, it had no battles, the sprites where cute and it was all mini-games, but it had nice music, a wonderful kiddie theme, the ability to make it harder too was nicer (with the Parent menu). The Pico version is quite good for the beginners as well, cute, but fun. Like the actual life of a dolphin calf, they're un-aware of the dangers, and have a carefree time until rounded up by the adults :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Me and dolphinjoy had a good story goin. then the forum went boom, like it always does, and it was lost. i still have the bits i typed up but not DJ's.everytime i break into pod member the forum crashes so i think ill stick to my puny little status thanx.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i'd still like to keep this site mainly a 15 and up site. with the exceptions of some 14 year olds. speaking of which....callyfin your 14 o_O; man seems like everyone here has aged rapidly except for you o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hah. o_o;; I remember I was 12 or 13 when I started my first website; just a simple one created in Angelfire basic editor about Tails.But getting back to Ecco Jr. - that still is my fave Ecco game....and I'm nearly 18 years old. o_O

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, she kinda comes and goes. But I wonder why Doomy never posts anymore? Or Swift Current...I know why Delphi hasn't been around - she kinda....forgot her password and stuff. ^^;; So I told her to either ask Arkon or Shadow to reset her account so she could come back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have a Gravis GamePad Pro...but I rarely use it. I prefer using my keyboard because I can pull off combo moves in fighting games easier.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i assume doomtrain got into her own thing. swiftcurrent has some sort of situation going on where she can only post at certain times. supposibly. and vantid. well you'll find her yiffing back and forth between here and them yiff sites.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i didnt know how to make websites originaly nor did i ever plan to make a website. i was into programmnig and was planning to make a site once my game was finished just so people would come to it to download my game. fortunatly i got into a feud with blackfin and over night formed arkonviox.com and overnight learned and mastered html. i say it took about two months until arkonviox.com evolved into a good looking website.

its been out there for a while. i just havent had the chance to try it. i never knew sega cd emulation has moved so far. last time i talked about it with anyone it was impossible to do. there was sega cd emus out there but they couldnt barley produce the main title screen. too bad emulation seems to be a dying force. or it feels that way anyways.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I am quite happy with it. I just popped in my old CD's (which I thought I would never play again.) and the next thing I knew I was playing Sonic CD. XD

What the hell is yiff???

<div id='container'>
I dont see any art here.

Thanks, Arkon. ^^ Ah....have you yiffed anyone yet, Arkon? And Cally, yiff is online sex for furries.More CGs! These are for some contests at school//sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/art/cg/senior1.pnghttp://sailorgalaxy.vortx.net/art/cg/senior2.png

He sure hasnt. And he had that one coming, dumbass Arkon. ._.

<div id='container'>
yiff can be good or bad depending on how you view it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You know not the meaning you jackass! You too old for that dumb shit man, why dont you stop it. o_oAnyways, Kitnee, i like the pics alot but just a suggestion: Dont use png's. No one uses png's for art. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Eh. PNG is superior to GIF for most things (Mostly because it comes in a 24bit lossless flavor too)Good for all the things you'd use GIF for (PNG-8) and all the things you'd use some 24bit format for, like Targa, without all the file bloat.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heh, don't worry Arkon, I'll be turning ye olde' 15 later this year (I'll be in Canada with Trellia!!! ^o^!). I can understnad your viewpoint though of keeping it to a higher age level ^^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
h don't insult mah Van-sis *smacks Arkon upside the head * :P I'm surprised that I'm back posting a fair bit at the moment - I kinda drifted from the site when it died.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yeah it kinda put me to a little bit of a scare. this sommunity needs something that will give it a boost. i tried to keep you busy, i tried to keep you wondering, but i havent gotten you guys hyped. we need soemthing thats the "new" thing to get descussion around here. oh well at the pace im working to get the managers working i hacvent been too good at finding new ecco news.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I think it's wise to keep kids away from topics like "giant snow penis" o_O;Callyfin you're 14? And you can draw like THAT already? When I was 14 my pictures were no good. You don't know me but I've seen all your galleries and was hoping to meet you so I could say how they ROCK! ^^;And also you seem very nice ^^ The opportunity never came though... but well this is off topic but your pics are so great!! =]

Maybe you were just looking in the wrong places Ark?

<br />
<div id='container'>
*nods* Indeed, thanks, Sha. I also like PNG better 'cause it's smaller in file size. Thanks, by the way, Crest. ^_^I wonder if Arkon visited Furrabian Nights when he briefly had Furcadia? o_O;;

<br />
<div id='container'>
*looks at Atolm'l gallery*...I feel like nobody...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yiffing is something of a compliment in arkon's case. Adjective, verb, noun. Hell, for arkon it can mean just about anything. -_-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
emulation is fading because products are becoming more difficult to emulate and game creators are seriously cracking down on emulation.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yes ocremix is a fantastic site. I have 90% or so of the remixes from it. Most are quite nice...

The problem with emulation right now is out of modern consoles, the only one remotely possible to emulate worth shit is the X-Box, and there just isn't enough games on it to make it worth while to anyone. The rest of the console systems right now have too high of processing requirements for the modern home computer to emulate to any satisfaction.

I can understnad your viewpoint though of keeping it to a higher age level ^^WHAT ?!?! You're younger than me ?!I though you were 17 or 18 !!!I'm older than you ! I can't believe it ! I'm 15 !!!

So wait, you're making it you're making it sound like the x-box would run better on my computer then the ps2. o_O;;and yes I've seen x-box emulators. No, I don't think my computer could ever hope to emuate it.

<div id='container'>
This is just to clarify for everyone, my official absence from the site. I have asked Arkon do downgrade me to a regular site user. He took away my powers and all that kind of stuff. I felt I spent far to much time here, and not enough time in the real world. I have grown fond of this place, and will probably visit every now and then, but it will not as much as I used to. Anyways, I just thought you should know. you wont see me around here anytime soon. When I do come back, my visits will be brief. Well, So long, and thanks for all the fish

The thing about X-Box is that you don't have to emulate any of the hardware, since you're dealing with x86 instruction set. The only part that has to be emulated is the firmware and OS API. Pretty trivial stuff.

Oh Trellia that is so... creepy o.o You had a great idea for this pic, it sure got my attention. I couldn't agree more with you, this war is completely insane... and all the money that could be used on jobs and other areas is being spent on this war... I don't mean to offend anyone, but I just hate Bush  :x

Searching in the Art section posts, I realized that the only drawings you saw from me are cetaceans ones.So, I decided to show you something different...  It took me almost 5 hours to complete it. I remained awake until 2.30 am yesterday to make the body, and I finished the pic this afternoon.I would have prefered to do the background myself, but, anyway...I pretty like the way it's gone   D Enjoy !httpwink:

As you all known and heard a 100 times i'm hoping eventualy i'll be able to make a fan game based on ecco the dolphin. heres my project list plans so far.1. finish the fan library and fix any bugs in fanfare.2. make some changes to the reviews section.3. perhalps create the cook book section.4. work on 8-10 blundercaves episodes.5. begin Ecco 3 A Stone in Time which will be the sequal to tides of time. it wont be out for a long time but anyhow we did some major revising to the storyline and here it is.-------------------------------The game begins many years in the future but not in the distant future where dolphins evolve. id say about 200 years after the tides of time.* Clondike an orca (possibly the decendant of kitnee ecco's old playmate) and a sea tortuse named Torrello are trying to get away from the dreaded orca clan known as the seven dark whales. *The seven dark whales are a clan of orcas who want to rid the world of Dolphin kind. They destroy giant familys of dolphins with no remorse. They are collecting new recruits to build up an army for the "Apacalypes". They are lead by Thorax a mutant orca whos eyes are yellow with three dark slits in them (the pupils). *The dark whales claim they have contact with a great and powerful orca from the future, who claims dolphins will become there superiors, which will leave orcas weak and inferior. Apacalypes was the only orca who found a way to become better, when the dolphins became aware of it they killed him later on. But his energy lived on, to contact his orca ancestors of a golden age which will decide who is better orca or dolphin. *The dark whales goal is to build up an army and over rule dolphins before they overrule them.*clondike and torrello find a temple where yet another time machine. This time machine is different it looks like a statue of two humaniod hands.*before atlantis was destroyed it was a floating isnland. then a beam from space destroyed it causing the contentent to split up into several smaller islands. the islands drifted far from one another and sunk into the ground. The city of forever is the largest atlantean city. *the atlanteans built many time machines. the most popular one is of course the one in the city of forever. the others reamin hidden away. the time machines all have the power to interact with each other. when they are all brought together then can open a giant portal which allows its user to tap into time and travel past present future, even alternate worlds.  There are five great time machines in all.*the atlanteans belive in time gods. These gods are responcible for allowing time travel. the time machines interact with these gods by communicating with them.  all the time machiens only have the power to call upon Clotho to allow users to travel up the stream of time into the past.Clotho - Spinning the thread of life (past)Lachesis - Measuring the thread of life (present)Atropos - Cutting the thread of life (future)*atlantean technology was created by the one known as the great geneuis. atla.*clondike and torrello witness the time machine open a porthole bringing ecco back.ecco vanished in the tides of time in ecco 2. he was brought back because a great event was about to take place which will possibly destroy time. time has become weak. ecco is allowed to return in order to save it. *ecco helps clondike fight seven dark whales who are pursueing him. ecco clondike and torrello are no match for these super orcas. but then the great thirian crestoe comes and defeats the orcas to allow ecco and clondike to escape.*the thirians are at war with the dark whales. the thirians are a dying race of warrior dolphins. they will do anything to prevent the end of dolphin kind. the dark whales are a bigger threat to them ebcause thirians play a giant role in the future of earth.*the dark whales are after clondike because he is important for the future of orca kind.*when ecco emerged out of the time machine another emerged with him. the incarnation of the three time gods. the creature is an energy lifeform. when the creature spots a vortex drone of earth it takes the shape of it and improves itself. the creature names itself vernineus/ the creature is out to destroy the ones who will destroy time.*ecco will try to use the time machine in order to travel back to stop the vortex queen. then a giant vortex opens destroying atlantis and the city of forever time machine. ecco is shocked by the events and no one is able to explain what caused this.*catcean creatures sing of a creature living in a machine planted by the vortex on earth. the machine from ecco 2. ecco finds the machine dorment. meaning all the vortex are gone. then ecco sees the vortex queen and an unknown creature. the queen is awakening this creature. *ecco finds out from the asterite that the vortex queen traveled into the past and evolved through the eons. because she could not dominate earth she had to live withen it. eventualy she left earth in a desperate attempt to save the vortex. for the past thosands of years shes been building a web in space. the web connects to all the planets in our solar system and when vortex coems into contact with earth she will connect with it and use all the planets energy to revive it and creature a super race of vortex lifeforms.*the vortex awakens her ultimate creation, the vortex king and takes it back to the web in space.*the vortex are planning to build a giant army with the power of all the planets in the solar system and invade earth.*ecco is told big blue is looking for him. big blue was thought to have died in ecco 1. ecco goes north to find him. when ecco arrives he finds the big blue encased in ice and dead. ecco failed or did he? big blues home starts to shake rapidly as if it was rising. ecco tries to escape feeling the whole place is rising from the sea. ecco jumps off of the rising sea scape. as he falls he sees a giant eye looking at him. ecco stops and begins to levetate with the power of this giant land. its a giant blue whale who has a the intire artic sea on his back. with ecco looking right at this great blue whale he notices the whole artic north is actualy this giant whale.*the giant whale identifies himself as dazer. dazer claims to have been living since the begining of earth. since earths energy is being taken dazer awoke taking the form of a great and wise whale who used to life withen his sea.- the big blue. dazer is the reincarnation of big blue. taking his conciousness and form. but big blue is actualy an energy lifeform created by earth. he tells ecco how he must destroy the vortex queen before earths energy is destroyed. he tells ecco how the core of earth is the beating heart of all life. that if this fire is destinquished all life will end on earth. ecco learns there is no more time to waste that earth is in great danger. dazer gives ecco newer powers to help save earth.*ecco descovers the vernineus battling the dark whales. the dark whales appear to be after the time machine and vernineus is trying to protect it. vernieus takes control of vortex drones nearby the directs them to attack. ecco learns soemthing is strange about vernineus he isnt here to help the vortex. *ecco is told of an atlantis where catceans belive the ocean's voice can be heard. ecco wants to find out how he can find an entrance to the web. there he meets delta. delta is a strange balooga whale with a part sharks body and part blue whale fusion. delta also has strange metal pipes comnig out of his back. *delta tells ecco he is the sea in a psysical form. he tells ecco how the sea became concious as earth became weakned and as a last resort he was formed. he tells ecco how the sea has been awake and alive for a long time. how the sea is made of a complex energy lifeform which has given birth to life. when the sea became aware of its existence it wanted to learn mroe about itself. the sea took the form of a combination of its favorite creatures. *delta the icnarnation of the sea tells ecco how hes been traveling through time and encountered an advance of super beings in the future who implanted him with pipes which allow him to breath underwater. delta clues ecco in even though hes a quasi psyical lifeform he is still limited by the air breathing abilities of the balooga..*delta tells ecco where all the time machiens are located and about vernineus and the web. he tells ecco how vernineus came out of time in order to stop an event from taking place. delta tells ecco how the dark whales have been trying to get to the time machiens but cant explain why they want them so bad. he mentions how vernineus is a vortex lifeform unlike any other who wants the time machiens just as bad as the seven dark whale clan./ he suspects the vortex queen is up to something but doesnt know what. he tells ecco how the time machiens will eventualy all have to be destroyed.  *ecco helps crestoe prepare for a war between the thirian dolphins and the seven dark whale clan. crestoe takes ecco to the city of thira where ecco learns of arkonviox. crestoe tells his people how he and ecco are gonna go to tantalus a sub city of atlantis where no creature has even gone to to bring arkonviox to help them. the others snub crestoe because no creature ahs ever been able to go into tantlus and survive. (this part of ther story still needs a bit of work.)*crestoe and ecco meet arkonviox. crestoe begs arkon for his help but arkonviox seems more interested in ecco. arkonviox elarns of ecco's popularity and says the only way he will help is if he gets a chance to fight ecco. ecco agrees and they fight a heated battle. ecco wins by chopping arkonviox's head off. all hope is lost. but arkonviox regenerates. and goes with them.*arkonviox crestoe and ecco prepare to help the thirian army fight the dark whales. but soemthing isnt right. arkonviox turns on crestoe and ecco allowing the dark whales to capture the thirians and cause mass deaths to many. ecco is alone. crestoe is gone. ecco goes to find the dark whales and find crestoe.*ecco travels to the dark whale home bay along the way he encounters dolphins slaughtered from battle and injured. they tell ecco how the dark whales took the thirians on a death march. *ecco enters the dark whale home bay. he finds himself surrounded by dark whales who are trying to attack him from every corner. then he finds thorax and  crestoes who has been defeated.  Ecco finds he is cornered with no hope of winning this battle. thorax looks at ecco and laughs at him.* ecco fights thorax who is like fighting an invinble wall. thorax defeats ecco which causes crestoe to wake up a hidden fury. ecco is shocked. crestoe begins to summon an energy beam, a mvoe called the gyguish cannon which causes a fatal blow to thorax. thorax starts to form energy projectiles of his own and sends creatoe to the ground again. the other dark whales come in and surround ecco and crestoe.* crestoe gets back up and takes them all on by himself. he holds them back enough telling ecco to escape. ecco cannot elave crestoe but as he begins to elave crestoe becomes covered by dark whales. to a point ecco cannot see him anymore. blood starts to come out in clouds ecco escapes.*the dark whales start chasing ecco through a maze of caverns. ecco feels them coming nearer and desperatly looking for a way to the surface. the dark whales have gained up to him by the time he hits the surface. then delta appears right in front of ecco and helps ecco fend them off. the dark whales escape.----- im gonna skip down to the final battle scene -----*the final fight begins with ecco and a army of dolphins ready to bgin there journey through the web.*ecco travels to vortex where the battle starts. this is where he fights vernineus who kinda gets stuck in eccos path. vernineus doesnt seem interested in fighting and tries to block ecco from his mission. that forces ecco to face him.*ecco travels to the heart of the machine where he faces the vortex king. if the king is destroyed it wil cause destruction in planetary scale to vortex. the vortex king is a giant energy sorce who needs to be taken out. ecco destroys it with little time to escape before vortex collapeses.*ecco travels through the web where he faces the vortex queen who has become very powerful she is the source of the web in space. and ecco for the first time feels her thoughts. he sees the web in its intirety. he sees a dark vision and the punishment she sufferent through eons on earth.*ecco destroys the vortex queen.*the web starts to break up ecco's friends who traveled with him get swallowed up in the destruction of the web. ecco desperatly tries to escape to earth. and makes it.*ecco travels back to earth thiknig he has won. but the battle isnt finished. the vortex king fell to earth and destroyed the asterite. ecco is told that vernineus was behind the whole planning and that the vortex king may be manifested by vernineus.*ecco travels far off to ehar dreaded songs of how atlantis rose to the sky again and how a great content took shape in the sky. he hears about a giant tower where all the time machiens gathered and how the dark whales have suceeded in a plan formulated by there leader.*ecco travels to the tower where he finds the vortex king working his way to the top. there ecco fights the vortex king again. and destroys is. then vernineus escapes in an energy form and works his way to the top.*ecco finds vernineus and a mysterious metal orca fighting. the dark whales surround the whole area. then we see vernineus absorb by the wierd orca. the wierd orca is apaclypes. he fuses with vernineus to become a super being. ecco looks around as all the time machines activate. ecco learned before the time machiens are all a key to a giant puzzle. the time machiens can all only travel into thepast. but if all there energy is combined they can open a giant portal which allows the user to enter and control time.*we see city of forever time machine's discs turn upward like satilite discs and an energy shoot out of them. all around are mini towers with time machiens from different atlantises shooting an anergy upward. the main tower is where apacalypes is. ecco decides to fight apacalypes in order to save time. ecco doesnt fight alone though. (still need to work out how im gonna get arkonviox to become good again and who will be present in this final battle.) *ecco defeats apacalpyes then everything is sucked into the porthole. ecco escapes loosing all his friends.

Great idea, Ark !I would like to help you to do this game...But I'll need help, because I dunno programming...

Erm....he looks a bit....femenin.......??!W-WHAT ?!  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i wont need any help. the game requires knowing alot about programming. then theres the in game artist..crestoes gonna take care of that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i do like it its good but he does look kinda femaleish.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i do like it its good but he does look kinda femaleish.Why ?!Because I didn't draw a fat hedgie, with big arms, big legs and a big belly ? Or because he doesn't looks like a body-builder ? *feels bad*In these moments, I realize that you and Trellius have never seen a female hedgehog drawn by me...Pretty, sexy and delicate...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I always thought it odd to reply to a topic made by someone who's not around. Ah, what the hell. You did good, Pho. You survived it as long as you did. See you around sometime.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i really like it sten! but i think arkon and trellius have a point. he does look a bit feminin. its ineviatble... girls are better at drawing girls, guys are better at drawing guys. its the way we grew up. when you were little, you drew princesses and stuff right? guys were drawing army men, and knights o_o; well, thats what my art teacher said anyways. i think its probably true for the most part. i still have problems drawing males.i think if you wanted to make him look a bit more masculin you could do the following:1) broaden his shoulders up a bit2) dont make his chest stick out quite so much3) give him thicker arms. not body builder necessairly...but guys do have thicker arms...even the skinny ones4) fix the thighs. im not sure...something in the thighs make him look kinda girlyi hope youre not offended ^^; but i think those tips will help you draw a more boyish sonic
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
bye phoi think everyone goes through something like this, even if they dont make their absense a big deal. you kinda swing in and out of different things. dont get pissed off arkon, you cant do anything about it. peoples lives and priorities change  :P

would it help if i said he is an attrative female?    wait a sec then how would that make me look c.c

I think it's cool but I have to agree with Trellia. Most guys I draw (wich is something rare cause I almost never do) look like gays that haven't come out of the closet o_O;Arkon, I'm sorry but, yeah that doesn't sound very good for you to say...

So how will you be ma,king this, will you program it as a traditional Ecco (sprites and stuff) or are you really going to go for the big bang and go 3D? I'm willing to help out in anything, assist in storyboards, or help Crestoe with art - etc.

Awww.... bye-bye Pho, and sorry about that whole big argument we had a few months back. ^^;; You're a cool dude, Phosis.But yanno....I gotta agree with Arkon on this one.

It's gonna be kickass either way! I have descendants?  Seriously, though, need any help, just ask us!! ^_^

<div id='container'>
Heh, it's cute, Sten! ^_^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Trell.....that pic is so true. *hugs*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*looks at Atolm'l gallery*...I feel like nobody...Aww, Sten, don't feel that way!! You're a great artist, too!!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Um......wow......I'm just gonna go.....over.....here now.... *runs away, fast* O_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ha!! Awesome, Trell!! And I know how you feel. &lt;3
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What's freaky is that it really does look like Arkon. o_o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
O_O;; No, I've always drawn animals ! o_o yeah im sure lots of us drew animals much more than humans...im not saying humans is ALL you drew...but i can assume that when you did, you drew girls...not guysThere is something I don't understand... If you think the arms I've done are slim, then, what do you think of the ones drawn by Sega itself ? They even aren't arms ! They look like sticks...sega style is MUCH different than what you're aiming for in this picture (as far as i can tell). sega style is deformed, hardly any anatomy rules happen with it...right? this is different...im thinking atleast
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I see what everyone's been saying, Sten. And Trell's right - Sega's style is more deformed and "chibi" looking (like my picture of Chibi Gobi). You're trying to draw Sonic in a more human-like way (like my picture of Ptek). It is a very awesome picture indeed! But he does look a tad feminine. So it might be a good idea to study some pictures of the male figure; I had to do that myself - I'm no good at drawing guys so well. X_x;; I once gave Pho a really awesome anime help site that shows you studies of male, female, and I believe child figures.Baka Neko

*K'Shd kept going forward, his eyes glued to his vortex warrior drone pursuers. He was in his flyer form, somewhere between dolphin and vortex, with folding insectine wings in place of fins. It was at the edge of space, where earths atmosphere bleeds off into the vacuum. Vortex biomolding kept him moving and breathing.  Desperate to escape this latest swarm, he dove. The heat was intense. He did not notice the sudden flickering light, for he was engulfed in fire already. The drones fared far worse, popping like arthropod popcorn due to the sudden change in pressure.He reasessed his situation. He had been in space, using his scent signatures to sabotage the vortex's constructions there. The latest battle, between the vortex and...something else had forced him to flee. He had not eaten in several days, and was beggining to feel the effects. He was beggining to suspect he was wasting his time, but without an idea where the vortex king was there was little he could doAs he descended to the sea, preparing for the painful shift back to swimmer form he spied something in the distance. It appeared to be a giant dragon...with...the great warrior ecco on its back...and two other shapes he couldn't make out. Weighing his options, he decided to try and flag ecco down. An opportunity like this probably wouldn't hapen again...In the dolphin tongue, which carried poorly in the air, he called out: "Ecco!"  *Sorry about entering late but I couldn't join until now. can I still please join the story? my character's not a cliche but will help a lot. Please? I posted this character before on the old board.*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
((Hey! Thanks for posting, I've been waiting for someone to bring this back up :) Its great that you've joined ^^))Ecco's beak snapped shut as is delecate senses picked up faint voice in the distance. "Myth! There's another dolphin, in trouble" Ecco called up to the giant dragon. Myth looked down at Ecco, loosening his talons lightly, allowing Ecco to slide free into the cold waters below. "Make haste littlefin, for we have little time to play with" Myth stopped beating his wings and lowered himself delecately into the water. "Mind if I tag along?" Whitefin  swam up beside Ecco, a stray long set of fur strands falling across one of her eyes. "Sure, who knows if what I heard really was there.." Ecco began to head in the direction the voice came from. Whitefin followed, staying close however. K'Shd groaned and looked over the expanses of the ocean, the two figures of Ecco and Whitefin aproching him cautiously...

I've really joined this site? Oh my g...*runs away after Kitnee* =P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
K'shd sent a burst of sonar washing over the two approaching dolphins, verifying Eccos identity. The other dolphin looked like none he'd ever seen. Of course, being half vortex, he had no right to call anyone strange. "Ecco. You probably don't remember but we fought together in the battle of lunar bay...the vortex are building something huge in space, big as our moon. Some being of immense power is attacking it. The vortex are getting desperate, Fivestar."  K'shd said in a low voice. He used Eccos formal title.Ecco listened with his head half out of the water, concerned. He bobbed his head then began to formulate a reply.

Sega's pics are totally different - cute, but not very realistic with the body and articulations moves.

It would be helpful if someone could explain all the different kinds of dolphin species to me in the Ecco world. I'm new and I need help developing my character. ^^; Any help is greatly appriciated...  ~ Zurimaji
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
something is wrong with the spacing. the box doesnt recognize paragraphs or anything. and the pagebreak thing doesnt work o_o; and i think theres a character limit on it, i coulnt post my whole story in thereyou should also be able to post into the same story again, for updates and such.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
stories are restricted by the html limit. you cant make any type of tabs or things like that. but...html will soon not be allowed. as for the limit that was an accident which i'll fix. and the page break does work your just not using it right...but i'll make it simpler.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
All the dolphin species?in the first two Ecco games we only see the bottle nose dolphin and the Orca whale and then we see the much fancier ones in the good future of earth.And then in DOTF  you have bottle nose, common and then the stranger dolphins, Clan dolphins, out casts, circle, crimson and.... crap I forgot the other one. Mover was it?*goes off to think*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hmmm there appears to be alot of bugs in the system. but i could you should be able to add onto the story and it should be able to post everything you could throw at it.but i did find problems with alot of things. i'll trie to fix them by tonight.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the "modify" thing isnt working for me. when i click it, it says "error: you are not allowed"
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't think you need to worry about sticking to the examples set forth in the Ecco games, but there is no reason to not let them guide you.DotF has the widest variety of the games.In the normal time-line, Ecco is a pale blue color and other dolphins are either green or have a stripe. The Striped dolphins are usually green with yellow, but some are blue.In Man's nightmare, Mover dolphins are yellow with read patches. The Circle dolphins are black with white and the crimson dolphins have red flukes and fins. I'm not too sure about the last two though.Clan dolphins have spikes around their dorsal fin and fangs on their lower jaw with glowing red eyes. Gaurds are orange with a black underside. Generals are grey with a white underside.That's a simple overview. But, I'd suggest trying to be as original as possible. And it's your character, you can make changes if you want to. Just looking around here can offer a wide variety of ideas, most fitting with Ecco in one way or another. The diversity makes it interesting. Best of luck to you.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks! =D You guys have helped me a ton. (you too, EccoChick) Now I must be off to develop my character...and also to go to band practice...X_@ thanks again!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I decided not to get the forum back online since the file for the forum is so huge and because of a flaw in sql that doesnt allow files with more then 4000 lines of text be uploaded at one time. I decided to start it over, also because i didnt feel like putting the extra work of making it work due to a project i will be working on in the future.So welcome back and while im at it happy new years!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Even if the old messages are not going to be added back onto the site, will you still relist the old forums, or are we stuck with this one?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, well. Out with the old, in with the new, I guess. Somewhat fitting, actually.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's great everything is back up again. Whew...I missed the announcment that the site was going to be down a while, so I didn't know what the heck was going on! Will the forums be incredibly different?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Unless theres a way around the sql limit, the forum database file is too big to put up, maybe i could trie again later but for now everyones gonna have to settle for this.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't really mind loosing the other forum. So long as sub forums are set up to post in.Seeing as how I'm bored at the moment, may I suggest a few additions? Like, a newbie forum so all the "Hi, I'm new" topics have a place to gather, without burying other topics that are relativly more important.And if you're in a giving mood, perhaps an offtopic art forum. Simmilar reasons as above, but one you can forever hold in disdain as "Arkonviox's Tax Exemptible Furry Preserve"See? It's tax exemptible. You can't pass that up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I been thinking about this for a while but i might actualy go forth with the plans. I plan to architech a new Arkonviox.com that doesn't use postnuke or phpbb but uses a system i plan to develope, or put simply i plan to develope my own forum and content manager that will be heavily integrated into each other. I just wanted to see if anyone had some thoughts or ideas, theres reasons why im gonna do this, firstly the forum's database has a bulk of information that is not needed and just clutters my site, second postnuke has alot of tools that just seem out of date and out of place, the security system is not fully implemented and simple enough, its good but not that good. I plan to make fanfare like Live Journal/Deviant Art/Elfwood combine, so we'll have a better system, and hey while im at it perhalps you'll be able to make your own custom forums with this new system, this is gonna be able to do alot, so please give me suggestions.Hey wheres eao when you need her?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I was chatting to her earlier. She went to get more tea or something. She also said "i wish a boat of supermodle women will be melted by lava". Yep.Right, fantastic idea, Arkon, as long as you can be arsed to do it, it ought to be superb.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Everyone around here looks faceless now. You need to get the avatar upload feature back on whilst we antipate the construction of the new arkonviox.com. :DMay I just say it's great to be back. Not sure what I missed before the site went offline, seeing as I was on holiday...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ahh, it's good to post here again after quite a few days.Can't wait to hear about the forum being reconstructed, sounds like it's gonna be wicked awesome  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I tried uploading my avatar and it died.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh good.  The forum's back.  Now I can tell everyone I don't plan on coming back here.  Ever.  And I mean it this time.  If I can figure out how to delete my account, I'll be doing that right away...Just in case someone wants to contact me for some reason, my e-mail address is NuevaPaz01@aol.com.  Which is also my sn, for those of you with AOL or AIM.  For MSN Messanger it's nueva_paz@msn.com.Goodbye.edit: There doesn't seem to be a way to delete my account.  How frikkin' retarded. &gt;.&lt;I'm still not coming back.And I'm not even gonna check this.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Tethys is leaving? But why? Oh crap, and she'll never see this anyway...drat! Why did she want to leave before? It was obviously before I came...that's too bad.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
After I made that avatar for her an' everything... :(Oh well. I'll see if I can find out why she left. *starts investigation*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Be careful what you look for Fargal, you may not like what you find.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, what's the worst that could happen?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i got that game..i  wanted...and i'm here now.should we have a funeral for the lost posts?hey I though that name wad Edger Reeve Arkon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm glad the fourm is back.BTW: Fargal, how's the comiect comming along?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
acctually i was thinking...if you don't mind, if there was an "ecco help/questions" so peple won't need an account to post only one time..and only in this "game help" they don't need everything a user needs.but its good to have i guess a shorter member list insteed of a bunch of one timers.I still wish that Mad Hatter feller keep his/her promace to reveal their true idendity.I mean one night i drempt somone joined under said name, next day it was true.freeked me out
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm glad the fourm is back.BTWDOh, and Eao's new avatar is how she will appear in the comics.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
okay2 more question: you still have the drawlings you did right?Is everyone still going to be in it?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
okay2 more question: you still have the drawlings you did right?Is everyone still going to be in it?1. Why wouldn't I have the drawings? They're on my pc, not the website. So yes, I still have them.2. Everyone who is still with us, yes.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Eao looks neat. There are some neat ideas for the new forums. I don't have any ideas. I don't really care how they turn out, really. Fargal, you changed your avatar! I noticed it is longer before it re-startes. It looks like you're actually speaking towards the camera or whatever you used to tape yourself. Is it the exact same one? The beginning looks identical to me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yay, the forum's up!!!  I'm kinda gonna miss the old threads and reading them out of boredom, oh well.I can't believe Tethys left.  Her art is pretty cool :(   (looks at Fargal's avatar for a while.)Wow, Your avatar is longer.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
My avatar is now longer (I now say "OH MY GOODNESS" instead of just "OH"), this is because the size limit of avatars has been changed from 10kb to 98kb...or something, so I can upload an extended version of my avatar. :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hello to everybody! I'm late!  ^^;;But anyway.... hey Fargal, your avatar stopped moving o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh it's moving again!(must be my browser or something) ^^;;; Looks cool!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey ho Nikita...hmm, my avatar seems to be the center of discussion. We need to get the other forums back up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I enjoy chocolate covered bananas.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, and as far as Tethys leaving, I'd post some scathing remark, but she won't see it...or will she. :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm sure you all saw this coming, which would explain why no one seemed to care about my leaving...I guess I've done this too many times for anyone to take it seriously.  I really wasn't planning on coming back, but, obviously, now that I'm in a bit better mood, I've changed my mind...But I am going to leave, at least for a while.  Even though I haven't been around much anyway lately, after being here a few years I feel I need to get away from this place for a while.  That means, not even any occassional visits like I've been doing.  I won't be around at all.  I won't be checking or posting anything.  But, since obviously I can't seem to stay away for some reason, that probably won't be a permanent thing.  Chances are I'll be back. But I don't know when that will be.  I'll still be around so you can still contact me.  I just won't be here.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey Fargal, show us some of your comics... even a preview or something.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm. I just realised that this forum is called "General Descussion", which is wrong. "Descussion" doesn't have an e in it. Right, about the comics...I have a picture that shows the characters who are going to feature in the comics, but right now I'm still gathering ideas for the stories. So, bleh. I guess I'll upload the characters picture when the upload feature for the forum returns.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm. You just can't leave this place, can you? :DGlad you decided to (sort of) come back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You *are* aware that the gallery is down, right? It would be a big omission for "The Ecco the Dolphin website to end all Ecco the Dolphin websites."
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yes i am but i wont be able to get that back up for a while since its alot of work to get it back online.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
GODAMNIT ARKON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't understand ! The "Spartateur" forum is 800x bigger than ours, and it never goes down !Does it mean that we lost all our posts, PMs, galleries etc. again ?...Sorry if I sound agressive, but it is the same time every year; and it's quite hard for me to bear, because I'm one of these people for which having a place with all sorts of memories is very important.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It wasn't exactly Arkon's fault that everything is lost...the files are too big to upload again, or something. Gah, we all share the memories in our hearts, Sten. :D
</div>
<br />

Hopefully everything besides the fourm posts will be back.

Notice I did not say I wouldn't be checking back this time.  So there's no reason anyone can't reply.  Of course, that will only be for a few days..But then, maybe no one wants to reply..
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hmmm i'll try to be here, but I've been having problems with the forum.like sending my messages and such. ah Its just i prefere having some of the regular sencery around, so thats why I'm "upsent" at your leave, Its better having "oldbies" around.  then they know you.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hmm...Well I sure you have some hidden talents Arkon, so you can set ahead 500 for web stuff a year.you know be the big Buck winner.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
A brand new forum. yay.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It costs $300 dollars to run this website?! Geez...I never knew. Does it cost more if more people join. Like people who sign up, ask a question, then dissappear. Does it cost some more money for a reason? I sure hope not...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
$300? wah. I make that in a few weeks. 00, sorry).  :D

Oh, and as far as Tethys leaving, I'd post some scathing remark, but she won't see it...or will she. Look, I said it. I'm totally the smartest guy ever...or maybe this has just happened about one hundred times before on this forum. I just tend to ignore them anymore. If anyone was actually serious, they wouldn't go about it in so childish a way. (scathing remark? Check.)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Right, that's it, I'm leaving. This site has the word "Ecco" around it too much.Bye.

I don't think that'll become a metaphor anytime soon.  o.0regardless, donating even a minimal amount of money can start it off well.  Every little bit of something helps.Don't look at me, though, my money's being saved for shopping because I got practically nothing for Christmas.

It's wonderful you've desided to stay, Tethys. I don't know why you wanted to leave before, I wasn't here at the time. Anyways, It's great you're staying.  :)

When I first saw this topic I thought you were teaching how to cook dolphins. I still don't have much of a clue how you play this "game" as such. Hmm...Steamed masters of transfiguration with treacle and custard?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, one good thing about redoing everything is you get to work out the bugs ne? 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i still have the cookbook backed up i always wanted to put it up but i wanted to put it up where people could submit them on there own, but im buiding the website from scratch now a brand new arkonviox.com will be made where it will be easier to put skins up and more. im gonna design a forum, the site, the gallerie (which will be new and improved) and impliment a deviant art style website but 1000 times better
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
If only we were all as wise as Trellius.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Right, sorry to interrupt the intelligent coversations, but.... I'M BACK!Dun dun DUN!!!!Well, I've been online, just really couldn't be bothered to come here (hey, at least I'm honest). But now I'm gonna, so HAR! You're not rid of me yet.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, you sound like i did, tethys. I think i posted about 10,000 "Im leaving" posts every day. Now, i just come and go as i please, and no one minds, or knows. Announcing your leaving is one of the things you will find people dislike most, and youll lose face for it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
is this an accurate calculation? Can you guarantee it will be precisely One Thousand Times better then Deviant?
</div>

<div id='container'>
Bah, enigma. o_o

Wow Phosis, when you're right, you're right. I couldn't give a greater crap concerning your presence. :D

Already noted. :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Why would we want to be rid of you anyway? :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The good thing about starting from scratch is unlike when i first started making modules for postnuke i will have it all preplotted on paper and any loop hole sorted out so there wont be any bugs.plus i wont be restricted to using postnukes lovely incomplete system. or phpbb's unnessary garbaged template system.I will have a whole new system that hormonously works together.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yes i can, it will be everything deviant and live journal isnt, but i cant garentee it will be bug free, there will be bugs, but yes i can definatly say i have an idea and system they wish they would of done.

Oh darn. I feel so stupid asking this, but how do you exactly make a quote appear on your post. Like         Fargal wrote:            and then what the person wrote lies here. I've tried it before, but it wouldn't work. I couldn't figure it out, and I feel like I just should know anyway...

Nevermind, I know what happened.  I wasn't logged in and it didn't let me post because the name Tethys is already taken, which is what just happened when I tried to post a second ago without logging in. x.x  I just didn't notice that there it didn't go through.

OMG...Everything is so different. I'm sorry I practically fell off the face of the earth for like, two months, but we were having major comp. problems..like this stupid arse virus.......anyhow, I've missed a lot. :( Now that I got a new computer though,(yesterday was my b-day) I can spend more time here, it's just gonna take a while to get it all hokked up and everything...I'm glad, though that I'm back(hopefully for a while) and I really missed you guys....I'm back!!!

um, i'm kinda having alittle troble understanding what this topic is about... :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, it started as a former section on the site, and the topic turned toward the great Arkonviox revolution.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Because there is that small voice in the back of your head that thinks this is an Ecco site.where did you get that idea?Well, here's the thing: It's a good site if someone's after a walkthrough or downloads, but not much has been done to keep people around who've done all that. By far the most active part of the forum has always been off-topic. It's just been slow at keeping the interest of the senior Ecco player.

So we have to retreat.Some of the details are as wrong as they can get (mostly phrases that should be replaced those funky inaccurate translations).

I think he meant to say "whistles". Learn to spell, EccoCode.

yea, I know you can change themes. I'm just saying, this theme is new to me and I like it o.o

yeh Arkon lets us make themes also...but he's doing stuff now, so he won't be able to implement our themes.

...or the gallery. Or the rest of the forums.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the gallery is crippled right now because i have to go through every single file and change the permissions, the best way to do this is to go into linix itself and do this but it is a bitch to do plus i need to install net pbm which creates the thumbnail sets ect...so its alot of work.as for the rest of the forums im gonna keep it as one forum until we start to see more activitie around here.

I'm not really either, EccoCode. However, I have a tip that helps me and it may help you too. Before I post I read over what I'm about to say before I post it to check mistakes. Do you type extremely fast?

I cheat. I use the spell-check built in Juno's eMail. Juno always uses 2 windows, one for the account and one for the internet. Well, you write eMails in the account screen. It's just a quick back and forth, so if a word looks wrong, or I have no idea how to spell it, I just plug it in there.

http://www.arkonviox.com/newenigma/fanfare.htmI created this concept for how the new fanfare section will look, basicaly now it will have a journal a way to keep a buddy list of friends, and allow you to organize artwork and stories and much more.This is the iniatial concept so please give me your opinions, by the way the skin i usedfor it is just for demonstration purposes, so dont bother commenting on that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i've seen better made up languages
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just like Ive seen smarter people on the Arkonviox.com message boards.Man your stupid. Haha.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i've seen better made up languagesFor example, the language I speak. Keraleum edam eruptions!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I see how you done it...a page dedicated to each member, which includes all of their information, etc.But yeah, the layout needs to be sorted.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Looks good. But like the Big F says, the layout needs a little work. Too far to the right.Yeah, looks like fun. I guess the one thing I don't like about the concept is losing that centralized feeling. It's harder to tell when something is added to the site. Can you tie something into the main news page that shows recent uploads? Maybe something on a weekly basis would work.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
seems like you guys didnt listen to what i said, this is a concept for a profile in the fanfare section not for the intire site.

this topic is way to stupid to stay open.

Hm, looks pretty well and good to me.  Since I'm a semi-avid storyteller, you can tell I'll be using it much.  I know others who will, too.   :P I haven't many comments about tuning it up, whatever works is what I say.

Not that post count really matters much. If it unlocked stuff, yeah, but here there's no point.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what kinds of things would you want to be able to unlock?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
http://www.arkonviox.com/newenigma/fanfare.htmi did some minor updates to the design.oh and fargal the quality of your posts latly have been rather poor, sometimes i see myself apologizing to others for your humor or hence forth lack of.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Its fun that we can post in locked topics o.-

http://www.arkonviox.com/newenigma/fanfare.htmi did some minor updates to the design.oh and fargal the quality of your posts latly have been rather poor, sometimes i see myself apologizing to others for your humor or hence forth lack of.Um...?Looking at this updated fanfare design, the potential is amazing...but would you really be able to implement webcam viewing into the fanfare page? And is the operating system really necessary?How much freedom are you going to give tom members, in the number of ways they can customise their fanfare pages?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what kinds of things would you want to be able to unlock?I remember this reward system from a while back...didn't you use to let people use html coding in their posts? I think it would be useful to award people with some personal webspace, so they could upload small files such as signature pictures.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
there will probably be a full freedom of customizing fanfare pages, but i cant demonstrate anything about that right now.as for web cam viewing no thats for a web cam screenshot, and finaly yes operating system is neccessary.i need real comments like what its lacking.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well, i was mostly wondering how this "cook book" is supposte to work and if Eao did say it, maybe alittle more detail...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ok fine..look E-code....we submit recipes...a recipie (if spelt correctly) is somthing that tells you how to cook food....we take a level from the game and make a meal that  has somthing to do with the level and or its name.take Home bay's Home fries for example. I will tell you what you need to make this.like a frying pan, margerian or butter, potatos and seasonings.then i will tell you what to do with the stuff needed.you print out the recipie and follow the steps and then make your self some "home bay home fries"another example would be "the hatchery's scrambled eggs"because you hatch eggs, and there are foe eggs in that level, so I figure why not make an egg dish.I will tell you how to make this scrambled egg dish
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I added some ideas for my system,1. create a ratig system for galleries, literaries (poems stories), and pretty much anything that can be rated.2. Add it so people can make polls and quizes.3. Add it so users can create postcards and send them to friends.4. i went with fargals idea so people have there own personal webspace.finaly: you will earn points with things you do, with will allow you to unlock things, yes its true the new fanfare will be able to do alot, but not everyone will get all its functions because you will have to earn them with postcounts and other things.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Great stuff. Could you explain how the postcards will work?I also have have an idea for the rating system-Comments should be posted alongside ratings describing why it has recieved a particular amount of merit.I really cannot see what is missing from this new fanfare design...you've got everything but the kitchen sink in there.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
people will be able to create postcards and submit them and send them to each other.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what kinds of things would you want to be able to unlock?To tell the truth, I honestly don't know. Two years ago when I was an Arkon-newb, I thought it was the coolest thing to get into Earth Clan and find the St. Gabriel's Mask Remix. But there isn't much more stuff like that floating around now, is there?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Some of you may have already heard of my plans to create a fic firmly connecting the original Genesis games with DotF.Well, here's the thing, I've been forming a lot of stuff around suggestions (questions, really) from other people. For example, someone asks what happened to the Atlanteans, and I put Atlanteans in the story. Someone wants to know about the Clan, so I put the Clan in the story. I've already started writing it, but I'm still open to any ideas that people want to see.I have also decided to let forum members take on token characters. Like a walk-on role. For example, Ecco is talking to 2 dolphins and Lizza wants a token roles. One of the dolphins is renamed Lizza. "Lizza" is now in the story. This won't work for eveyone. For example, Arkon (as his character is) is too much of an icon to have such a role. But I can try to fit anyone who asks.I started a forum to write updates about the fic.Azure HorizonAnd, yes. I am only writing this because people said it couldn't be done.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I belive you can do it.

it all sounds like a cool idea.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
okay, i think i get it alttle better, thanks.

Being able to unlock options with post counts sounds like fun!

I wonder what will be done for "Neverending Process" I'm almost afraid to ask. Or what about Blades in Motion? Oh, nevermind. That just involves a blender...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
For Blades in Motion I would create a smoothy or a milkshake, since it involves a blender. Makes sense to me!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So do I.  Hey, writing fanfictions can be tough, especially with going to such methods and using the many ideas coming to you in the best way.I don't have a suggestion as of yet, but I wish luck!  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It seems tough to put all those things together, but I'm sure that with some time it will come out well. Good luck!!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I see the forums sure have changed in the past few months I have been gone but its good to be back.*anyone remember me?*Lol well Ill bet no-one does
</div>

ecco, why what is this newfangled demeanor?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Looks grand Arkon, always something new and exciting in your bag o trix and this one deserves a round no?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ecco, why what is this newfangled demeanor?Fatal error OE has occured, please reinsert brain and try again.I myself am an Ecco and cetacean in general freak. To the point of having open threatened with bodly harm any idiot who calls a dolphin a fish, or Ecco "just a stupid squeeky thing". Many have died needlessly.... :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Dont know Arkon, something not too stressfull to enable but still fun or entertaining to have? Like sytematically being able to customise litte things about your account and postings like  with say 100 posts being able to change the color of your post's window/box thingy, or custom titles etc etc.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Nice one Art, what about in-depth explenations? I recall a long time ago someone posted a theory on how the glyphs worked things like that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
he sites gonna be very different from what you seen on the net ever.aside from special profile pages for users i'll also have groups each with there own forum, users will join groups and visit the individual forums.There will be a group with its own forum dedicated to art, literaries, dolphins, arkonviox.com itself, ecco the dolphin, and more.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ha ha, thats pretty good trelluis i actualy had that in mind, as well as something even better a special frame that goes around your posts too, thats hard to explain.anyhow with more posts you will earn that alongside the ability to create postcards, polls (on your profile and in forums) create quizes (on your profile) you will have to earn the fader (for your profile) and the last level will allow you to be able to create groups and at last create a forum.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That someone may have been me, actually. I do have an in-depth explaination for the glyphs, but I might only put that in if it comes up.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Atta boy Arkon. Always one step ahead.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well could you humor me and add it anyhow? Or even better we could discuss a few things like this at a point?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sonds like a grand Idea Arkon! Though creating your own forum? Isnt that hard?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well..... that was almost as much fun as a vigorous man-handling.  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It would be easy to put in. Other than glyphs, anything in mind?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Pfffff........the time machine? How the hell the Asterite can keep his balls together  how does he 'stay together' ? :?
</div>
<br />

The point, my oh-so-fluggedy friend, is that Uesagi_Kenshin came back to an ecco-related site and either  for some reason does not realize that is what its about, or  has a misconception as to the meaning of demeanor.  both. or even  None of the above and was just rambling like I often do. :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 I was waiting for that....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
a forum shouldnt be that hard, everything im gonna work on is gonna end up on a drawing board, im planning this out first then gonna program it. so it should come out perfect. and yes iuts gonna take a while to do.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I kinda expected that. Anything I can do? I have meager coding skills, but anything I do is something you don't have to think about.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
just help me come up with ideas i could throw in that i dont already have there. you can see what ive done so just tell me what else you think i could have for the new site and what else i should add or do.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
any idiot who calls a dolphin a fish I absolutely HATE it when people call dolphins or whales a FISH! Where the heck have they been! I don't know why, but it angers my so! People, come on!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
"You know, the whale is not really a fish. It is an insect."I overheard that yesterday. It recieved a well-deserved laugh.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
At one time I thought people could be recognized for their specialties. At the time, I was thinking shells. (Blue shell=Comic specialist, Green=writer, Red=artist)  I dropped the idea as pointless, unless the shells in turn meant something else. I don't know what, a "craft's guild" for each specialty. This is made obsolete by the new forum setip that will be in place, but perhaps it could be canabalised, in part.Something to do with the games? The anagrams became quite popular and lasted a surprising long time. I experimented with building them on Ecco glyph screen shots. They could be brought back with more meaning. I draw one up, post it somewhere important looking and after a period of time give credit to those who answer correctly. The first correct answer suggests the next anagram and I repeat.Not the greatest ideas, keep in mind I thought them up while sleeping, more or less. I hade more, but most involved new forums or rewarding skins. Also now obsolete.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 I was waiting for that....Sorry, couldn't help myself. :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Could you tell me how the site is going to be laid out, or haven't you designed that yet?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
funny....you shoul d have somone say that in your fic...i recall hearing somone say once "she's sucking it out of me like a snake"i'm sorry but snakes don't suck....spiders suck....ticks suck, but snakes don't slurp-inhale-suck!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The Asterite is a mysterious being...he could be held together with vast amounts of energy.  Maybe he's a gathering of a bunch of entities packed together.  Or perhaps, he lives on the very life force of the planet itself.I had a theory for a story that the Asterite is an advanced creature or machine that might have been sent to Earth by the Vortex to scope life out for their feeding.  (Ecco had to fight him in the prehistoric levels...ergo, the Asterite was evil once?)As for that fanfic...hm, maybe the Asterite from the Genesis games is somehow connected with the Guardian?  They both seem to have the same depths of wisdom to me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
any idiot who calls a dolphin a fish I absolutely HATE it when people call dolphins or whales a FISH! Where the heck have they been! I don't know why, but it angers my so! People, come on!man, i don't like that either...well, just the thought of it.(a little soemthing i made, not to dis dolphins/whales or something ) Untimate insult for a Dolphin/Whale: to be called a fish.

As for that fanfic...hm, maybe the Asterite from the Genesis games is somehow connected with the Guardian?  They both seem to have the same depths of wisdom to me.The Asterite and the Guardian are real close in the fic. And that's all that I'll say. For now.

I thought that DoF was just trying to start over with a storyline somewhat alike to the original Ecco games only It's a little less elaborate and complicated.

I wonder who the very being was that came up with the idea of a dolphin as the savior of the world? I would have never come up with that idea, unless I had a tragic fall and banged my head pretty good.

I thought that DoF was just trying to start over with a storyline somewhat alike to the original Ecco games only It's a little less elaborate and complicated.Ergo, nobody thinks that it can be linked to the first in one storyline. Which is exaclty why I set out to write it in one storyline. Any specific points where you don't see it could be done? (ie, holes for me to patch while I write the story)

Hmmm. this is very interesting. I can imagine some things like how the asterite works, but I never saw the glyph thing. Why am i always late in these posts? ._.

there is a nasty e-mail virus going around, and it has the ablity to send you the infected e-mail using the adress of somone you have mailed and adresses you have placed in your adress book.it was ment to attack some company that has somthing to do with Linux, but it hurts everyone.please if you haven't warned anyone do so.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
If we recieve this e-mail in our account, is there a subject we can recognize before we open it up? For example the "I love you" virus. The e-mail subject said I Love You, so you knew that was that particular virus. Does this one have one too? I don't want to run into it and not know it's there.

Check out these two links.http//news.com.com/2100-7355_3-5149504.html?tag=st_rnEveryone, UPDATE YOUR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE ASAFP.  Any updates created to catch the first one WILL NOT CATCH THE SECOND VERSION.I've received this virus almost a dozen times within the last 48 hours.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What makes this trojan (yes, it's really more like a trojan than a worm - although it does use a computer security exploit, it would not be able to spread if people didn't click on untrusted attachments in crappy email software) interesting is that it launches a distributed denial of service attack against sco.com on Februrary 1st. What's probably several magnitudes more relevant is that it opens a port and will execute arbitrary code sent to it, thus making an infected box completely open to attack by anyone who knows about the existence of this virus, can Google and compile stuff for win32...BTW, I haven't received a single copy of this virus yet (and  even if I did, the Debian GNU/Linux system that I check my mail on would hardly be infectable by it). For this I can probably thank either AMaViS and spamassassin.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
don't forget, not all of these need to be "invented" they could be takes on popular recipies....I suggest Chicken Soup for the ToT level "sea of birds"with either star noodles or mini shells.don't forget htough, some people use Metric...so we'll need transations for messuring, also try hard to make the ingredience "cleare" some food brands aren't international...some are, some people might call somthing by another name.try not to call "jello" Jello....i want this to be a "kind" cookbook so international readers can easily make the food.I'm also trying to round up people to make a Genso Suikoden cook book. In the 2nd and 3rd games you can make food items. I'm writing them all down.possibly all recipies with all 5 versions (you can add suger, salt, soy sauce, red pepper mayo or nothing to the dish) with all recipes from both games  could be equal to all Ecco the dolphin levels (CD versions of Ecco1, Tot, the ecco jr game and DotF)

Well, people have slowly begun to come back. Things are getting back to how they used to be slowly, but surely things are speeding up as more people return. Welcome back Mutaclone!

I posted a preview on CoH, so I might as well get around to doing it here. I don't like posting my work until it has reached some conclusion, so I'm not putting this into the library just yet. Plus, there are some bells and whistles I want to add that can only be done after its finished.PS Otherworldotherworld 60 Million Years Ago*The stars of Delphineus shined down brightly upon the Earth, watchingover her sapphire waters. All was quiet save the gentle rocking of the tide, andthe silent whispering which only the stars could comprehend. Back and forththe stars chattered. About the seas. About life. About time. About trouble. Andabout the enemy that must be stopped.At the center of each of the Sacred Stars was a swirling mass of brilliantcolor. The color rolled and erupted from the fiery ball like the sea's mist. One byone, flares shot from the stars, sending forth the brilliant globes which wouldcarry the protection of Delphineus to that distant watery planet, which wouldsoon fall under the gaze of more ravenous eyes. The eyes of the Vortex-kind.*Earth 3rd year of Unification*Pilot moved carefully through the murky waters of Epsilon Station, amining facility much similar to the one where he had grown up. He wasfollowed a another dolphin, Icarus, whose mottled yellow skin identified him asa Mover, like Pilot. He was just a little younger than Pilot was. He had comefrom Omicron Station, one of the first stations found after the Unification.Icarus wore a labor harness, a tool that had once been hated by some, and hadbecome a symbol of salvation since a one dolphin, Ecco, had shown them theproper way to use it. Right now the two dolphins were inside the centralcomplex, approaching what Pilot hoped was a control center."Prime Mover, there is something up ahead." Icarus called to Pilot. Pilothad been made the Prime Mover of Delta Station two years ago by his tired andaging mother."Can you tell what it is?" Pilot asked, straining to see what Icarus had."I'm... not sure..." Icarus said slowly. Pilot thought a moment. "I'll go on up ahead and find out. You see if youcan get power running in here."Pilot couldn't wondered what had happened to Ecco after man's weaponhad been shut down. No one even knew what caste he had come from. Somedolphins have abandoned referring each other by their caste solely because ofthat. Ever survivor found sparked the thought in Pilot's mind that they wouldfind a dolphin at least resembling that strange dolphin.Pilot entered a large room with rusted wires and beams hanging down tothe floor. Much like most structures after man's extinction. But still, somethingdidn't feel right about this chamber. Pilot's echo vision was becoming confusedby the wreckage. Was that a dolphin he saw back there? He swam forwardslowly, not yet wanting to call out. Yes, he was certain it was a large body,another Mover perhaps?"I think I've got it!" Icarus' voice floated out of the tunnel Pilot had exited.Within moments, the lights flicked on around him. The extra illumination letPilot's eyes see what his sonar couldn't.*The Grand Chamber: The Dark Period*Tursus waited for the parting doors before him to slide completely out ofhis way before looking back at his companion. Two smaller dolphins movedswiftly into the room to check its safety. When they called back, Tursus madehis way forward with slow and powerful fluke strokes."Is this it?" His companion asked, disappointed. "I was expectingsomething more... impressive."Tursus looked about the room, sparse save for a few glowinghieroglyphics. His eyes locked on one, the symbol of power, the swirling redcyclone."This is it. Your doubts leave much to be desired, Jade." Tursus flexed hisblue-grey back. He looked at the reflective surface of one of the walls, studyingthe triple cyclone mark of a Clan General on his side. He had never appreciatedit as much as he did now. He focused on one of the smaller red-orange guards."Darksky, you said you've been here before. Where is the chamber?"Darksky looked up at Tursus. "Behind that wall, sir. Only an Exalted Onemay open it, I know no other way."Tursus groaned. There hadn't been an Exalted One for three years, notsince the revolution started. That was why they were here."Find a way. The generations before us were arrogant, but not stupid.They would not have hidden the chamber if it were useless anyway."What Tursus hoped to do hadn't been done before. Never before had theMutaclone and his Exalted Ones been vanquished. There had been chaos forthree long years. And all of that would end soon."What happens next?" Jade asked."Next, we are given the one thing that ensures our victory." Tursus lookedat the red cyclone. "Power."Cautiously, Tursus swam toward the marked wall. Becoming moreconfident, he dove into it- and found himself in another room. Lined withbubble-torches, the room lead to yet another pair of closed doors. The twoguards hurried in after Tursus, followed by the other general. The final doorsslide open with no protest as the four dolphins came close, revealing atransparent crystal shard."Bring it to me." Tursus ordered one of the red dolphins.Darksky moved forward, but could not pass through the open doors.Tursus watched as the dolphin began to look sick, and started to shiverviolently."Your general has given you an order." Reminded Jade.A wave of remorse briefly passed through Tursus as the guarddesperately tried to move forward, then fell limp with a final cry of pain. Tursusmotioned for the other guard to pull back Darksky's limp body."Take him back to the first chamber and wait there." Tursus ordered."He's not-?" Began Jade."No. He's just weak." Answered Tursus, quickly. He started to passthrough the final doors. He could feel the shard's power already, pressingagainst him, crushing against his body."Wait here." He said to Jade, then dashed into the final chamber, its doors sealing behind him.

<div id='container'>

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thats just ignorant you don't even know what that word means, here i'll help you out.homo any of a genus (Homo) of primate mammals that includes modern humans (H. sapiens) and several extinct related speciesi guess it can also be used to mean "of the same" but it doesnt nessarly mean gay.

<div id='container'>
I don't know you, but welcome back.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmmm 1 percent evil.That should be right. *nods*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yay! Miana! *huggles*Heh, don't worry about it, I pulled the same act that you did for over a year. ^^;;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah I disappeared for awhile too...apparently not much has changed around here, it's just as crazy as ever.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
because your UN has a number in it, when you don't need a number fishyOh, now I see. Yes, of course! A number doesn't matter because it isn't a word, at least not in that form.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't know you, but welcome back.Miana must have disappeared before you found this place EccCode. Either that or it's just a name that's not ringing a bell. I know I've never met Miana.

<div id='container'>
I'm a little late, but I read it a while ago, and It's awesome!!!!! Can't wait for more!

She won't be coming on anytime soon to answer that, as she's constantly grounded from the net, but She choose that name, because, her real name's spelled Jacque, but she didn't like that, so she changed it to Jackie T (T=initial of last name) I told her that now she had an E for ecco, and She capitalized the E and put the T on the end. JackiEt. Not sure if anyone analyzed that, but...btw, what the heck DID she do to the end of her sentence?!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Welcome back Miana! ......late as usual...*mumbles to self*

The site has been left in a strange state-the aftermath of the site being re-located...it'll probably stay like this until Arkon launches the "New enigma" Arkonviox.com.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I try to put quotes from the story up on my forum. Which is, for the most part, just updates for Otherworld and... other projects...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wait... did I not welcome back Miana? Shame on me...Uh, yeah. Hello.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
LOL, now there's a thought, what's more evil, words or numbers?   Numbers for computers and calculators, methinks, but words can cause emotional damage.Hm, my comparison up there is only 76% evil.  Heeeeee

How did you find this site anyway, OrcaCaller? Just surfin' around or was it for something else?Oh, I found it from a message board I like to hang out in for a favorite web comic of mine.  I thought it was interesting, so I thought I'd share it with people, just for fun.I thought, what is the most evil group of people I know?  Then It hit me.  Right here!  P

I'm looking at it now, an it doesn't say "unreleased" anywhere.

http://www.giantmicrobes.com/I think some of them are kind of cute.  don't fret, this link is harmless.  Its a link to a shop who sells stuffed toys in cute versions of microbes....like bookworms, dustmites and illness like the plauge.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I wonder if they have herpies and colon cancer in there, that would be a delightful way to educate children.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
you could try making a sugestion unless, of course Cancer and Herpies aren't microbes.

I've looked, but I don't see the word 'unreleased' either.I want that CD though...I've got that CD, along with a few other *non-ecco* out of print albums that are getting harder to find as each year passes.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Color me stupid, but arnt all the songs on the CD already up in the DL section?It's one thing to be able to get copies of the songs, but it's something totally different to actually own the CD.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Well aware of that Brain, I was just confirming whether or not it was up for grabs. Nothing quite like owning a cop though of course.
</div>

In answer to all your questions;Yes I'm back for good, and I'm much better, I'm ready to jump right back into everything.  My life is just so frantic right now that even something simple like posting here can take a few days to do o.o  I'm squeezing in all the time I can though and I will be saying a lot more as soon as I get enough free time to actually sit down and right it all up.  It's good to see everybody I knew again and great to meet all the new people too..and and yes eao,  aileron = fin  noir = blackI'll try to manage to post in the next few days.-AileronNoir

How do you create you own avatars? Do you just draw them somehow and by using a scanner, save them on your computer and upload them?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm begining to love this place already.

Perpetual Fluidity sounds like a fun drink. Up and Down could be a drink too, but Down and Up is closer to the truth   Jurassic Beach Burgers? It could be made from reptile meat  :P

I draw them with my drawing tablet, seeing as I don't have a scanner, and then upload them.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm guessing a drawing tablet is some sort of computer program, right?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually it's a board you put on your desk and 'draw' on. It then transfers the information over to the computer as you work.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Think of it as virtual paper...unlike when drawing with a mouse, the drawing tablet is pressure sensitive, so you can draw thin/thick lines depending on how hard you push down, etc. The results are very realistic given the right programs (Corel Painter seems to be the best tablet drawing program out there).
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, that sounds like a very good idea. No wonder all the pics I've seen that have been drawn with that system look incredible compared to most mouse drawn pics.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah...I want a tablet SO bad......the mouse kills the hand and alot of times produces slightly crappy results if you're not completely careful with it. Of course, with the death-grip I have on things, I'd probably break a tablet.....

Trellius used to be called Trellia, that is until gender confusion set in.  lolwink:

I've had a hint of sorts in there ever since I joined and so far nobody seems to have noticed it o.o  I'm ready to give a little more information out now anyway so I'll tell a little more.  The link thats been in my profile is http//www.go-gaia.com/ and just about everyother comunity styled website I can find, I'm about to start a design sheet of all the website which will plan out what elements to use from each website I've studied and waht custom things to build.   That will take a few months and then I can start programming it all up for next year.-AileronNoir

Congrats! U got it, yeah I forgot to finish but I'll get around to it. I just haven't played Ecco that's why I forgot about it, but I finally got past 4 Ways of Mystery a year ago, when testing stops I'll redo and restart the guide!  lol:

Hopefully you all remember me. Its been almost six months scince I've posted on good old Arkonviox.com. Wow, it feels nice to back. My absence was due too poor grades c.c So, I hope you guys remember me. O_O;; Also, I'm a little confused here...I don't want to sound like a dumbass or anything, but what the hell happened to the other boards? I'm too lazy to go back and read the old posts -__-. Someone summarize what happened while I was gone.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, hey MoonFin. It's good to see you. Well, Arkonviox.com was shut down temporarily and Arkon had to re-create a lot of stuff, including the forums. (I think.) So, only the General Forums existed, and now there is a new Arkonviox.com currently being constructed. It is supposed to be incredible and much better than this one, so this website is dormant for now.  Don't expect much to happen, at least not until this new Arkonviox.com is complete. Not much else has happened except some more people returning.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yep. Arky ois hard at work on dossens of other projects AND will be taking a certain trip as well soon so Arkonviox.com will be slow in rising again but still get there.   Oh and welcome back,
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So.......why DSL in your ear? :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Murfle.I think I'm back too, I'll try to come on more often.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow, you have been gone for awhile. well, hope to see you on more offten.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks guys. Thats some interesting info. Can't wait to see the new site. Good luck to Arkon. Also, Eao, I need the url to the avatar that you made me a while back. No prob if you don't have it anymore.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well its pretty self explanitory really, if you were to direct the creation of an Ecco game , what would you make it look like, do, include? What plot twists? Which sub characters? And what theme would it have? Dark? Romantic? Violent? Happy? Sad?  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*bounces* Hello! Welcome back!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
HI!!! I remember you. Welcome back, I have just recently returned as well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I'm not sure of an exact plot. However, if I got the chance to make an Ecco game it'd be  dark, sad, but a happy ending (I'm a sap for those). There'd be a lot more creatures in the game; more species of dolphins &amp; whales, porposes (I just know I didn't spell that correctly), sea lions &amp; seals, polar bears, etc.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes, more species would be cool.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i think he can change your name.Me    I don't want my name changed.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, everyone is returning!  :o I'm glad you guys remembered me. ^___^
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I would have romance in it, with a touching story. I love games like those. A game with happy parts that make you smile, those that make you jump and sometimes even slightly freak you out, and sad parts too. Yeah, more species would be great! A fantastic selection of all parts of the ocean, that would really be neat!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
An Ecco game with a proper combat system.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So far so good, I agree particularly with fishy_1 there.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>

A game with happy parts that make you smile, those that make you jump and sometimes even slightly freak you out, and sad parts too. Yeah, more species would be great! A fantastic selection of all parts of the ocean, that would really be neat!I agree, but romance? Isn't that kind of hard to do with dolphins  N E way I would bring back the cool prehistoric levels, more species de-fin-ately (pun), uh... plot... dunno, I would make a generally happy (maybe a couple of sad parts...) game, a few games are really depressing, and I'd make it not too hard or easy, so every1 can play!  :) Also, I'd make some variety, like maybe 4 or so levels you spend on land or in an aquarium or some civil thing like that, maybe even a space level (that be pretty cool, swimming through space or something...).
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 I agree, but romance? Isn't that kind of hard to do with dolphins  Well, I don't see how it would be that difficult, but it seems like a pretty good idea to me. Just me style...oh and the space sounds great. Swimming through space, that would be fantastic! And think of how the graphics would look? They could have Orion and Ursa Major and stuff, Shooting stars, comets...other galaxies, stars, and even nebulas. Oh, that would be just beautiful! I certainly hope so if they make a new one!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
A space suit for a dolphin... that would be pretty cool.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Whee! Welcome back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Honestly, I doubt they will make a new Ecco game. But I find the idea of dolphins and romance to be very interesting. Its not hard to idealize dolphins and romance, after all, dolphins are very lovable creatures. lol. Swimming through space, thats awesome too. More species would be interesting. In my opinion, more blood would be cool. It would just make it more realistic.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I can't remember if I've met you before... Welcome back anyways!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow...I don't even know where to begin...but, hello everyone...   ...to old friends (you know who you all are), and possibly new ones! For those of you who don't know me...I'm...dolphingirl! So...what has this place been up to!?!?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well well well...  ...how could I resist replying to this topic, and the posts within...heheh! AileronNoir/blackfin!!! *hugs* It's nice to see I'm not totally alone in my return here, although I'm nearing a month later than you did...heh! It's sooo good to see you, and all my longtime old ECCO friends here... =) ...count all you here that remember me in the list...'specially you Arkon, and EccoChick *hugs to all*...heheh...man you forget how long eao has been around. even miana, or trelluis for that matter.....even me o_o; were the only people who can say things like remember yogoat? remember dolphingirl? remember the undercaves? the original forum? coral? buddy? remember how crestoe used to make avatars for everyone?Well, I can say I remember it all...and reading this thread of messages brought quite the smile to my face! *sighs* I certainly have a lot of catching up to do...with all of you...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Not the same Dolphingirl that used to post on the gamefaqs Ecco messageboards?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The signature looks like DolphinGirl from Gamefaqs.Anyway, Welcome!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Welcome back dg, its great to see you back, we had alot of fun in the old days, i kinda miss them. i guess the only new thing up is im trying to rebuild my site from the ground up, i'm creating a new enigma, but its gonna be more work then i think i can relly handle. I also now know what i been needing to know for years to get my game i been trying to make off the ground but unfortnatly thats alot of work too, so i been slowly working on both projects.other then that theres nothing new i can say about my life besides the last 3 or 4 updates ive made on my site.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 In my opinion, more blood would be cool. It would just make it more realistic.Blood? Good point, no Ecco games have blood, although Ecco is generally for kids (I think), so I think that's why blood might not have made it. Also, on the space-idea, it would make perfect sense because of the Vortex aliens. Maybe Ecco could blast away Vortex with a special harness or something. Or he could do a Hanging Waters level in Space (like in the beginning of E: DotF, when the Dolphins and Humans are flying through Space in... bubbles). Black Holes could be considered Whirlpools (Great Winds of the Water).
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey, dolphingirl! Welcome, or welcome back... uh... your choice :).
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just wonderin', who are your fav. character(s) from the Ecco games?I personally like the Crimson Fins from E: DotF.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey there, your's is a name I remember. Welcome back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I like the clan dolphins.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Another cool feature would be an RPG-style system. Defeat enemies to level up and gain abilities. Whenever you beat a boss or hard quest/mission/thing you get a Vitalit to help advance a little bit quickly in health/mana/stuff like that. Whirlpools could be considered Dungeons.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think I like the Sky Singers from ToT best, as they're the basis of my Glyph Caller story. And the only dolphin society, in all the games, whose ways come as a mystery.  You just meet them and talk to them in the games, that's it.That and they're so pretty  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
A dolphin RPG, that sounds pretty cool. Or like a MMORPG, like FF11. (haven't played it, but my friends talked about it)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I agree with OrcaCaller. Those flying dolphins are awesome, and it would have been cool if they included them in Ecco DotF. I also like the clan dolphins...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
A dolphin RPG sounds excellent.  wink:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't believe we have met, but its good to have you back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes...'tis I...the same dolphingirl who used to post regularly at GameFAQs...sadly to say though, I've not been there in an awfully long time either! I must pay that site a visit too soon. Anyway... :D ...nice to meet you Brian, EccoCode, and MoonFin (cool name)...and thanks for the welcome! Artreus, Shadow_Dolphin (I assume that's you...who went by one on the forum and the other in chat)...so good to see you both...and thanks for the welcome back! And...Arkon... ;) ...it's incredibly good to see and hear from you again! Ah yes...the good'ol days...I miss 'em too! I've read the updates and it looks like you're up to your ol' things still...learning how to create and make your ingenious ideas fly! It'd be cool to chat about things...hopefully I'll see you all who go there sometime soon!*waves, with a big smile*

Personally, Pilot has always been my favorite. He was always eager and curios, and always looking on the bright side of things it seems.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What's with the quiet entrance?Nice to meet you :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Multy player would be sweet.

Unfortunately, I have never met you dolphingirl, but, yes indeed, welcome! Welcome!

<div id='container'>
i helped Moonfin (tail) with her name and character.i'm still here, barley...boring times and school hinder my presence.

some people i think left here forever...but you still have me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i'd like to see if appalosa/sega would sell the rights to ecco to some overly competent company.who would be the best owner? how much would it go for, taking in account his/the game's popularity isn't that of Pokemon, mario, sonic, Link/Zelda, Sonici'd think any of us here after wining the lottery coul buy ecco.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
good to see you got yor pic back..i never plasterd it anywhere...arkon's forum lets you upload them
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey Arkon, somtimes when i go to type in the white box (when posting) no letters show up, and vertical lines score up and down the whole screen as if smearing what is on the monotor.what is this problem?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
its your computer or more specific your browser, download mozilla at mozilla.org
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh my goodness! It's you! Wow, so very glad to see your back...many fond memories from "the test of organised empty carrots". :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You mentioned Sonic twice.Whatever happens, I don't want to see Ecco fall into the hands of EA Games. Sorry, but some of EA's latest really lack a certain shiny quality.If a new Ecco game were to appear, I think it would be perfectly suited to the Gamecube...and not just because it's code name was "Dolphin". :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hahahah...  ...yes FargalEX...those were some awesome times - organized empty carrots...a test no less - heheheh! I'm just happy to know you still remember it after all this time! By the way, I love your avatar...  ...though, the Brillo one was cool too! So good to see you again! Same goes to you Eao... :D ...you're always a cornerstone member to this fansite! It's good to see you're still here! Nice to meet you fishy1, and Kirtan (by the way, knowing how this place can get sometimes, and after not being here for such a long time, I wasn't sure what things would be like with me showing up, so that's why the "quiet" entrance - heheh)!

Ecco would be overfranchised and turned evil and bad (if it went to the creators of Sonic, Mario, Zelda, etc. You have to admit those games are WAY over franchised) !Also, you guys took my MMORPG idea  evil:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Shadow_Dolphin (I assume that's you...who went by one on the forum and the other in chat)...Sorry, I'm not who you think I am, I didn't realize the coincidence of Shadow/Dolphin and Shadow_Dolphin until after I made this name.  roll:

<br />
<div id='container'>
Aye....uhhh.....long time no see. Was wondering what happend to you. O_o;

<br />
<div id='container'>
Heya dg! I've missed you :) Hopefully you will stick around this time, heheh. Maybe I'll catch you in the chat sometime.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ecco Jr? Just kidding =P Trellia I guess.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's great to see you back dg, I did a double take when I came in here and saw your post... I really didn't expect to see you in here....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'd have to say what I've always wanted to see is a branching plot .... say in one level you can choose between helping a friend or chasing an enemy.  The choice you make takes you to a different level for each decision and you get to control to a degree how the story unfolds...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hmmm blackfin? =p
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
its nice to have you back. hopefuly sometime i can have you meet my crazy girlfriend there and be able to catch eccochick and my stupid younger brother. i told eccochick you said hi btw o.-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i always liked the asterite, but i also liked blackfin cause it was funny making him mad and seeing all the hilarious messages he'd give back. i also liked trellia.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Trellia as well, and her themesong is also my fave on the 16 bit versions.  Nikita is Integral now?   *looks around for a certain vampire*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*notes a decided absence of his name in the list mentioned and blinks sniffing his armpits* Its the green complection on my avatar isnt it. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ahh yes choice. always been a wonderfull factor of gameplay so few really use to its full potentian.  One thing I liked about games like Baldur's Gate 2 is the fact that whethere you choose good or bad the story does go on. The main thing is you CAN make that choince. :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Or you could just be over-eager Eao, wait for it to finish loading before typing, I get the same on IE when I type before its done loading.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh heaven forbid XD 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Probably. And the brillos are not forgotten. In fact, the brillo website has actually been updated...see, they do care. Ehm. This avatar should change pretty shortly.Nice to see so many people coming back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
could be both....acutaly...its not being over eger at all.is opra a good browser?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ecco is to underdevloped for me to have a favorite character.sorry
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I recall doing this before, but prehaps we could write fan music?some of use are poets some of use are sequencers and or composers.why not go and re-do some pretty 16 bit music and have some write words.go look for tracks from Final Fantasy Pray....they did what i'm talking about.just because its' 'ecco music" dosen't mean it has to be ecco-ie...FF pray's songs have no refrence to the games or characters (go to animelyrics.com and have a lookse)but of course throw away by creativity...go on let me monoplize it.all i really need is people to record with.think of that wayhttp://www.livejournal.com/users/kuwaizair/150174.html?mode=reply
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So.......why DSL in your ear? :?because i have a "56k dial" up conenction and it takes me an hour to download mp3s...3 minutes to open this page and some others 6.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i wasn't kid naped by teh evil furr-eh empire...I think Swiftcurrent has a forum on her new page..well she has  a LJ...I tryed to friend everyone from the ecco community on cityoforever to keep tabs on themlast i saw she was crying about working hard of art and then people paying attintion to those with no talent.but people grow and change and get new better friends...me? I'm lame.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm... choice... yes... That would be cool. It probably won't happen, but an evil Ecco (*ahem* Sahdow Dolphin *cough cough*) would be interesting. Ecco is saving the future from his destructive self... yes...A free-play arena (doing stunts and other stuff like that), and/or a sand-box mode (make your own levels with unique characters, sort of like PS2 T.H.U.G.) would be cool too...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmm....I love Trellia and the sky dolphins. Pilot was cute...because he followed you around for the longest time. And I liked the clan dolphins because they were cool looking....And Mutaclone, naturally. Lol.And Big Blue. How about him?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Trellia as well, and her themesong is also my fave on the 16 bit versions.  Nikita is Integral now?   *looks around for a certain vampire*Yes and he's hiding in my sig in pixel form.c.cAmen.

<br />
<div id='container'>
So.......why DSL in your ear? :?While chatting on msn messenger Eao attempted to write "I need DSL in my area" a number of times, spelling it wrong but going back to correct it a number of times before giving up. I haven't explained that very well...bleh. It's just a typo essentially.

Hey... uh... Arkon? You know if you tried you could make a small Flash/Shockwave/Macromedia/whatever Ecco game if you tried. It'd be pretty cool to see that on your site!Arkon actually started to make a proper game...but I'm guessing development has been postponed until the new arkonviox.com has been launched...and other things, like his free time/commitment have to be considered.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
On an unrelated question, uh... how'd you think of the name FargalEX?Right, not sure how many times I've had to explain this, but...The name FargalEX, which I use online or in games was created when I attempted to enter my name as "FargalEXTREME" into an N64 game, Perfect Dark. Unfortunately the name did not fit, thus FargalEX was born. The "Fargal" part of the name was actually the name of a blue bird cartoon character I made when I was younger. Go here to discover more.

Trellia as well, and her themesong is also my fave on the 16 bit versions.  Nikita is Integral now?   *looks around for a certain vampire*Yes and he's hiding in my sig in pixel form.c.cAmen.That looks like Vincent actually....and conciquently me O.o;Amen.o.O; I like when Akado has long hair... *drags him around by his hair* ^^

I like the crimson dolphins. The sky singers (i guess that's what you call them from ToT) Pilot, i'd like always hit him. Ecco (course). The clan and outcast dolphins.

As many of you might know Moduvator used to be an administrator and moderator here on Caverns of Hope. Well up until recently he thought it was a good idea to start his own Ecco the Dolphin website and defect from this place because it didnt live up to his standards.Anyways many of you probably got emails from one of his faggot as cronies, if you happen to get any emails from any of his cronies please report them to ethier PsySonic or I so we can take the appropriate actions. The reason for this is Moduvator has stolen content from both PsySonic and I's websites, has even stolen design ideas and if any of you seen his site you'd see the structure is almost exact to here minus the graphical talent. Also if it werent for me he wouldnt have a website, i provided him with the host which he gets for free, and if you look up his information for the site and id be glad to post it here itsAndrew DemidovVishnevskogo 10/86Kazan, Tatarstan 420043RUAdministrative Contact:Demidov, Andrew demidov@bancorp.ruVishnevskogo 10/86Kazan, Tatarstan 420043RU+7.8432389382this is his home information, so if you want to send him hate mail or even packages of dog crap thats on fire this is the address to send it too.The reason why i want to make this a public concern is if you like cavernsofhope or are a visitor of my site, or anything else do not go to his site and support him, its people like him who put people like stalin and hitler in power.i recently banned artreus for emailing member sof my site about leaving here and going to mods site, i dont tolerate that kind of garbage here if your gonna use my site to contact people about destroying it then you will be banned also.anyhow this has been a community out reach from your friendly nieghborhood arkon.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I would have to say that my favorite characters, besides Ecco, are Big Blue, the Asterite, the Skysingers , the Movers, and the outcast dolphins.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well I have no idea who the sh*t Mod-thing is, or what the f--- he's doing, so I'm fine.  :) (Btw I only sweared because it looked appropriate for this Mod-crap-monkey guy.)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I must have missed something big. I've heard of this Moduvator guy, and have seen talk about how bad he is or something like that. I guess I have no worries then...

o.O; I like when Akado has long hair... *drags him around by his hair* ^^Its Alucard! A-L-U-C-A-R-D, get it right! XD Seriously though ,the translation bollox-up they did thee is attrocious. It IS Alucard  no matter what the so called "Hellsing experts" say, because he IS Dracula, you see as much in the final eppesode, he is Vlad the Impaler, I.e. Vlad Dracul I.e. Dracula and so revesed that in the whole secrecy thing to Alucard, sheesh!.........................oh yeah, Amen.

<div id='container'>
Ahh the Brillo is back, and in a thundery metalic blue no less   Aye aye, ill be sure to post it here of course, no idea how good it wil be but well see. Aslo once the holidays hit I am going to do what ive been thretning to for almost a year now, take up the old Ecco rpg in the Arkonviox download section and finish it, the creator is long gone, or dead or something so if  he has a hangup about me continuing with his project he can haunt me or whatever, but it has bee picking at my mind for ages now I liked it and must finish it, so any ideas or suggestions for storyline?  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I havn't been around here long enough to know about Ecco fansite politics, or to form a strong opinion about any of them. One thing is for sure though; I hate plagerism.

your avatar scars me.That makes 2 of us.

For those of you who don't visit Caverns of Hope, here's a special preview of Caverns of Hope 2, a completely new site that PsySonic and Silverfin are creating, with original content! Werhay!Enjoy.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Which RPG, what holiday season (Spring Break, X-Mas, Summer Vacation), and... Brillos, yes Brillos... (Move over FargalEX, there's a new fan of Brillos in town, place, thing...) uh... Brillos   j/kAn RPG? Sounds cool! Try taking the suggestions in this topic maybe?

Arkonviox, you kick ass.Hey, honestly, I used to be a supporter of Caverns of Hope. Then one day I pulled my head out of my ass and realized how much better Arkonviox.com is. Caverns of Hope is dead. No one posts. Ever. Also, here, we have alot more rights. Freedom of opinion is one of them. I realize what Moduvator has been doing, and its a load of bullshit. ^_^

Fargal, work on your quot n skillz. shock:It looks nothing like my previous avatar. I had Excel playing a guitar. Anything but scary. The smile was friendly.

I will be honest with you moonfin i'm not the biggest fan of caverns of hope and psysonic isnt the biggest fan of my site, in fact we were at war once ourselves, but psysonic and i are friends now and silverfin and i are like brothers.but yeah i still have old feelings from the olden days were i feel betrayed with people visiting there but i do visit there alot too. so i dont care as much as i used too, caverns of hope has been alright latly anyways the problem is though alot of my members who usualy post frequently here go there alot i think thats what makes me mad cause they use coh's being mactive as an excuse for not coming here saying "well if this place was more active" and thats when i relly feel like putting a bitch slap on people, its bullshit for them to say something like that especialy since its people who make this active, its you rpost that makes this place active you can make this place interesting you just have to post something cool, alot of people dont want to do that, so basicaly all i have to say to them is fuck them all i hope they die.caverns of hope is alright though i hated it alot when moduvator was incharge now mod has his own site and i seriously hope he fails...hes been giving me shit about his midis saying i stole them when in fact he posted them up there, if you know how my music section works it allows you to post your own stuff, all he had to do was take it down but he didnt, if he wants them down now hes gonna have to shut down his site, only then will i enable his account again so he can take them off himself, cause im not taking them off especialy since i didnt put them up there o.o

"well if this place was more active" and thats when i relly feel like putting a bitch slap on people, its bullshit for them to say something like that especialy since its people who make this active, its you rpost that makes this place active you can make this place interestingYes! I hate it when people leave forums because of that...and I am not leaving this place. Not until Arkon decides to shut it down, or I get banned.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
eccocode you need to stop visiting mods site, if i see anothe rpost from you on that site i will spank you, you dont need to support mods faggot ass....that must mean you visit those forums as well, Arkon.It's all well and good going to war with some twazok because they have almost litterally copied everything that you have worked so hard for, but you shouldn't take away people's freedom.

Hey... D ...seriously...EVERYONE...it's good to be back! Oh yeah! And Arkon...I'd love to meet this girly-friend of yours... ;) ...that'd be cool!

In the Fargal cartoon?  Or something else?So, let me get this straight: Fargal is a bird cartoon you made? And Excel is something...You are extremely dense. Let us leave it as that.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Whoops again!  :? I am dense. Fargal is a character you made up "when you were young" right? And Excel is something from an anime, right?I'm keybroad-unfriendly... or clumsy or something.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I just wanted to let you know that I'm leaving ark.com for some time, arkon.You don't have to ban me anyway, coz I'm leaving by my own choice.And for several reasons:1) You and shadow have been treating me in a way I don't like these last months (porn, etc.)2) I'm more and more disguted by your porn posts (erected man eating a foetus, for example)3) A lot of the good friends of mine I met here aren't on the forum anymoreBut the most important reason is that I can't bear anymore the way you treat Moduvator.I understand you consider him as an ennemy; but in this case, he's YOUR ennemy, not ours. A lot of people here don't even know him !I've had a lot of good moments on this website, but the atmosphere here is getting too heavy for me.Maybe when it will get better, I'll take a glimpse on it again.I don't wanna quarrel with anyone here, but just want you to know I don't recognize this website anymore, and feel like a stranger here.I just hope you'll understand my choice.Seeya someday guys,Stenellya
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Arkon, i will always support your site, i don't want to get in the fight you and modu is having. so for now, I won't post on his site. I might not even lurk. I play online games most of the time, so that's what i mostly do with my free time.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I thought everyone knew not to look at Shadow's topics. c.c
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I thought everyone knew not to look at Shadow's topics. c.cI hope your not talking about me...  :?Because I didn't do anything!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No, Shadow is an admin here. I was once bothered by his topics, but I decided not to care. Bye Sten...I really don't want you to leave, but its your choice.  :(  Honestly, I could care less about the quarells between Arkon and Moduvator, although I do have my own opinion on things. The behavior of people is is nothing at all bad to me. This kind of stuff goes on in most forums I visit anyway. With all the memories spent here, I don't see how anyone can leave. Its like.....a soap opera, in my opinion. But, whatever.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
nothings gonna happen to stenellya, i was referring to stenella who isnt a member of this site.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No, Shadow is an admin here.You mean Shadow/Dolphin?Even though I don't know Sten, I'll miss her.  :(
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thanks eccocode, no one needs to visit his site anyways he's an unfit webmaster, and if i get my projects finished you'll see you don't need his site anyways.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Whooopsies!   ...my mistake...heh! I was confusing Nikita with Noriko, who does have the same first name as me I believe. Anyway, sorry 'bout that! Nikita, nice to meet you...and I'm sorry to hear about you and Arkon. On the bright side, at least you two can still remain friends... D ...as I stated before, any chance I get to see dolphins in person it's a magical moment! Yes fishy...it was awesome! So, if that's one of the places you'd like to someday visit, what are the others? I do have to say though that there was more for me to do at Sea World...what with the Dolphin Interaction Program (DIP) in which you were able to, for a price of around $130, get in the water with a small group and get a "hands-on" experience! Now, that was a blissfully memorable time indeed! If you're a dolphin lover, I'd highly recommend either place! Where do you live fishy? Are you close to Vegas, California, Texas or Florida? I hope I'm not asking too many questions...heheh...but if I could just ask one more...does your avatar have to do with lil' Nemo...as in Finding Nemo, the Disney movie?!? Great one, eh!?!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hi Miana... D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah, how silly of me (slaps head with fis fins). It's me DG.... Frie ;)Just under a new name though, heh.Sry 'bout that  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You mean Shadow/Dolphin?Yes.Even though I don't know Sten, I'll miss her.  :(How is that possible? Bah.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
...does your avatar have to do with lil' Nemo...as in Finding Nemo, the Disney movie?!? Great one, eh!?!I made it for fishy_1, she wanted an avatar of a dolphin "smiling" at a clown or butterfly fish. :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
if i get my projects finished you'll see you don't need his site anyways.Any progress on "New enigma"? Or are you still developing for those other websites?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Haha, yes indeed Fargal made me that avatar. I did want a Spinner dolphin smiling at a fish for an idea I had. If you want to know, dolphingirl, I live in one of the most boring places ever. The good 'ol Central Plains of America! I'm surrounded by nothing, but crops, but every place has its beauty in a unique way, right? If you like quiet peacful places where nothing ever happens, come here.   I someday want to visit outside the boarders, like Scottland, and Madagascer, and Australia. Someplace with adventure and wonder blasting natural sights. Las Vegas is just a dazzling looking place that seems like every corner has a surprise. I love places like that...er, most of the time. I have been to cool places such as SeaWorld in Florida, but other than that, I usually don't move around much. Still, I do love my home.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i been done with developement for other websites, and as for new enigma i had the user system completed but when i formatted i lost that stuff so now im just reworking on how modules and stuff will work. I relly hope i can speed through this and get it up by the end of the month, i mean the basics and stuff...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You mean Shadow/Dolphin?Yes.Even though I don't know Sten, I'll miss her.  DWait... that's completely wrong, oh well something like that...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wait... that's completely wrong How true that is.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I haven't seen Him around.also Sten..the fetus wasn't a real one. it was a hoex.......and with the sex-type pics. I recall you saying sperm cells are cute.where is Dolphin/Shadow? I need my Password for my web site......or else i need a new one.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
he's in the chatroom or on aim where you can always find him.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Is that you, Friecco... :D ...? "Frie" didn't ring a bell by itself...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah... :D ...well, nice job on the avatar there Fargal! It's cute! I know a bit what it's like to live where you're surrounded by flat farm land...I lived in Atwater, CA for a few years which is in the middle of the Central/San Juaquin Valley of California...where most of the produce is grown for the whole US. So...yep...nothing but boring to me...though, it has a couple nice things...very fresh tasty strawberries! Other than that, I'm used to living at the base of a 14k ft. peak in Colorado...where I was born and grew up. Now, I'm in a southern California beach city with a view of the ocean and beautiful sunsets every evening! So, I do have to say it's nice to get away from the dulldrums of "boring-land" and see some real eye-candy sights! Anyway... =) ...it's been nice chatting about locations!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well at least your still in the good old USA, if you travel anywhere else in the world you go to alot of countries where they hate america and americans even though they are the biggest hipocrypts cause they drink our drinks where clothes like we do and listen to our music, but i admit you do live in the boring part of cali, i been there even up in clear lake wher emy mom lives its worse.but trust me it could be worse i thuoght of those possibilities.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thats friecco
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I happen to live in Hertfordshire, which is just north of London. Here you will be able to find lovely nature, beautiful sunsets and gangs of 13 year olds parading the streets.

europe isnt so bad i was mainly reffering to most of the other places.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
oh....just the chat huh?ah....why dosen't he help police the forum?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
there isnt much to police.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
anyhow i think moduvator awareness week is over...i made my point clear anyone who joins him will be banned, but he is not a threat to me, just a small bug which i well stomped out.fuck you moduvator and fuck all your friends, i'll see you all in hell on the day of judgement.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
For the last few years after the undercaves closed the Ecco community has degraded postnuke and phpbb will be replaced with another, and then there will be mu after that for it will be the last time Arkonviox.com is reloaded, and once thats done the process of reviving the ecco community to its full life will be at hand, until finaly the job is done, and the home you come to grow and love will be sealed away....and with that the whole ecco community will slowly degrade and eb away. so its your chocie how this new future will unravel.the day of judgement is at hand.

People will start to be picked away one by one as there life merges with this shadowy figure. Soon death will incarnate into a human form after enough life is lost, and judge those who wronged it, our souls will not belong to us anymore as they become the oil and greese which will become known as the blade of death, and it will be those peoples faults who didn't listen to  the warning signs. People will begin to wish and pray only to find they arent being answered, as the creation of there own maknig destroys them off and feeds from there fear. The shadows and darkness in which it came will overshadow us all, we will feel its pain, we will feel its fright, we will no longer see another happy day and hope will be no more, because our chance, our only chance for salvation had passed, the savior who was to protect us and save us all had incarnated into what the people feared and deserved most....darkness from light, hate from love, choas from order, why do we exist? why were we created? why is it feeling empty when it should feel whole and complete, why cant it be alone when it seeks the strength of others, perhalps its just an inner conflict of the one we call god in which we were created in its image, or perhalps all very small pieces of a puzzle known as existence.

I was having an interesting conversation with silverfin which led to me classifying operating systems as religions. here we go...Linux and all hybrids of UNIX = islam.why islam cause you must be an extremist to fully understand and control its power, most people who use linux are insane and very very hardcore computer geeks.Windows = christianity.you dont need to be very religious to be a christian, in fact you can have not read the bible at all as long as you know jesus (gates) owns your soul.Mac OS = peganism.peganism is cool but not to be taken as a serious religion except by hippies and tree huggers. it seems cool has alot of cool things about it but not enough support, it was at one time a big serious religion but now its become a dying one.anyhow i'll add more as i start finding more OS's

so what is it you are saying Arkon? If interest does not pick up after your renewal Arkonviox.com  will go into mothballs? basicaly its time for me to stop doing so much work on my site and time to relly get started on my game, im unhappy with alot of things on how my site works but i cant do everything, or always be unhappy with the system or look so now im working on the final upgrade.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what linux is very extreme, windows does require you to follow a leader, and mac os is for hippies, doesnt mean im saying the religions are wrong im just comparing OS's to exagerrations.hmmm....you know no one ever talks about christian catholic extremism, but it existed in a worse form then what we see with islamist extremists today, i belive the nazi's were a sort of form of this.

I banned Dolphin/Shadow from Arkonviox.com, i'll show you why www.arkonviox.com.The deal is the following. The owner of this site had been given my music by myself (as MIDI and MP3 files) to get hosted. The music files are created, seqenced and thus copyrighted by me. The proof of this are the headers of all the files at that person's site, which are listed in the included file "files_list.txt", is the "copyright" field. ("Copyright  by Moduvator"). You can clearly see the headers in any viewer. Or you can use this tool//www.vgmusic.com/database/analyzer.php which would print out all the information it can get from the MIDI file.I have now decided that I am not comfortable with the site owner, hosting my music, so I have tried to remove the files via the web-interface the site is equipped with and which I used to upload them. The result was files permissions errors (I have included 2 screen-shots and 2 text files with the error messages). Then I contacted the site owner, asking to remove my works. He said that he doesn't know anything. I am including the e-mails he has sent meDespite any efforts I could not get my works removed. The site owner refuses to do that, motivating it by that I have to shut down my personal site first. This is an absurd. Now he has my account on his site suspended "until I close down my site" - how he says in the forum.According to the copyright laws, I have all rights to decide where the works that are owned by me shall be published at. I am giving you 72 hours to make the owner of the site (arkonviox.com) comply my request. Otherwise I will be seeking legal advice over the matter, with a view to sueing him for still hosting copyrighted material on his website when I have asked him (and tried myself) to remove them.If you need any more information, please let me know and I would be glad to provide you with it.Thank you.~Andrew Demidov.this is an email that came from Moduvator, he sent it today to my network administrators who keep my site going, the problem is he would of never thought of this. I keapt his midis and mp3's on my site mainly cause he put them there, he has asked me to remove them but the thing is he had the power to remove them himself, the only issue was he was banned and had no way to do that. I refused to do it cause i am not too worried about him, and knew he wouldnt be no threat to me.Well he had asked dolphin for advice and even contatcs for my host and administrators who control my server, as well as info that will pull the strings and possibly the plug on my site, this is a guy who i trusted with my passwords and site and even chatroom giving advice to people like moduvator who want to destroy my site.So i banned Dolphin from the main site and the chatroom will be relocated with me as the head admin and no other, which means Dolphin is no longer with us, I donald trumped his ass.the chat room server will be located on irc.shadowworld.net on channel #DarkSeas. I also will need some co-OP's since dolphin and the others ar eno longer with us.

Oh no no dot get me wrong Arkon, it was an amusing bit of reading. But Religion is a touchy topic and can turn ugly VERRY quickly. That why most avoid talking about it outright.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Understood of course, but will you then simply not upgrade or will the entire site go down for good?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh no no no Arky, we were simply left stunned in awe. it takesa while to recover after all.    Nice one though, I can guess at your inspiration.

i belive the nazi's were a sort of form of this.Hitler was a catholic choir boy in his youth.And he was a vegetarian. Not that it has to do with anything.

<div id='container'>
right now there will be a very big complete system change and site redesign, if that doesnt boost activity on this site then this place will just become one giant archive, but i know it will work, it seems its that time now...

its kinda funny how you can have a copyright on somthing that really isn't yours.like if I paint a "prefect replica" of Boris's artwork...and like somone steals my pic for their site"omg you infring on my copyrite"the only thing Mod does is sequeance and or re-write, the midi i gave you is just copy pasted (i iz talened music writer,,,spencer neilson shtoll my moozac)too bad Shadow gave him the contacts...but in my eyes, he has less standing than, lets say if Spencer neilson has if he saw you gave his music away for free.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ha ha thats a good point eao,its okay i still got a copy of all those midis i'll probably add them back eventualy, for now we must wait till the day of judgment.

Linux and all hybrids of UNIX = islam.why islam cause you must be an extremist to fully understand and control its power, most people who use linux are insane and very very hardcore computer geeks.You know, I'm offended not by what you said about Linux but by what you said about islam... well, anyway, here's my shot at the same thing Shamanism. You have a priesthood of people who generally tend to smell rather bad and often work inebriated. They are, however, the only ones who can use the Power Words to contact the Gods and discuss with them.Linux (the "easy-to-use" distros) Satanism. You don't want anyone else to tread upon your computer. You also talk a lot about magic, daemons, the evolutionary theory, and have at least one file whose permission bits are 666 on your hard drive.Windows 9x series Christianity. At least I agree with Arkon somewhere.MacOS: A five-year old's christianity. You've been told that there's a higher being that takes care of everything and every time you use a computer your mental capacity goes low enough that you don't care to know more. Oh, and you have a strange uncle who's spent the last 20 years saying that your religion will soon be dead, and it's still kicking.

Many of you know I been working on a big story for a game i hope to program one day.  It will be the third installment in the Ecco the Dolphin series (not counting Defender of the Future since it was intirely a different game.) I have the skill to begin programming it i know how to program using many forms such as the windows api, direct x 7 or 8 and even java, i just need to figure out which one will be the best conidate.Anyways Crestoe, designed another of the seven Arkon's this one is Xiavnokra which some of you might of known once as Xoivnokra or even Xiovnokra, well the name has been finalized and the character design for him has been completed.Xoivnokra is Earth elemental he is also dead, in my game he will be portrayed more as a monster then a logical being. He has many powers such as the power to poisen his vistims and control them like puppets. I havent created much of a storyline to him, i had story lines before for him but they ended up being canned. All i know is he is one of the major Arkon. There are 7 arkons in all each representing an element there purpose is to basicaly hunt each other down killing one another until theres one left who will take on the powers of the others and transform into a radicle second form.http//www.arkonviox.com/arkonviox/artwork/The_Dolphin_God_of_War.jpgand of course you all know of Arkonviox.http://www.arkonviox.com/arkonviox/artwork/Arkonviox.jpg

i did alot of research about atlantis and the place you know as lumeria as well as research on a place i come to know as Zurvan or simply put the tides of time.Anyhow Lumeria is actualy confused alot with a more ancient place called 'MU' some say they are the same place, i still don't relly know but i can tell you what i do know//www.conceptual.net.au/~jackc/mu.htmChurchward wrote alot about MU probbaly around 4 books on it, i have one of the original books i wish i had one of the more interesting ones but anyways He wrote of MU being so far advanced you wouldnt belive it. MU had advance technology they drew energy from an unknown thing known only as the source, this thing -the source, gave them possibly knowlege and even power to there machines, and possibly was what destroyed them. Sounds kinda like chrono triggers 'Zeal' thats wher eit was based on.Theres more to this Mu was not completly destroyed, its belived many of the people of MU escaped into agartha, a world located withen the Earth which sort of has its own atmosphere. There you will find the ancient city of shambhala a place belived by many tibet buddhist monks to be a place where the most enlighted are allowed to go. If you ever heard stories of monks searching far in the mountains through the Himalayas usualy this is what there searching for, those who never came back were belvied to had made it to shambhala.the wisesest of the people of shambhala were known as 'Shinning ones' they keep records of all of human history all the way up to MU, they also have old records of atlantis and of technology, also they also have technology more suprior to our own and even somewhat evolved more then us. they also manipulate the evolution of mankind too or so it is belived.heres some info on Mu and agartha.http://www.crystalinks.com/shambala.htmlI do belive shambhala is probbaly MU and that MU may exist somewhere condensed in the north pole. another story of a fighter pilot from world war 2 explains how he flew into this place far beyond the ice and cold, into a place that has plants and life and is hot, there he seen giant mammoths and many ancient mammals that were belvied to be extinct and beyond that he found an advanced city that has flying machines and great technology.Now to tell you what i know about atlantis, the story of atlantis is a wierd one because it ties into MU.Atlantis came into existence somewhere between 30,00 BC - 23,000 BC Atlantis may have consited of people who left the MU motherland, at some point in history MU and atlantis may have gone to war, or had some sort of conflict or possible race in becomnig better in technology.i can say atlantis was far more advanced then mu 14,000 BC was when the reached there highest point in technological creation. Atlantis became popular because of plato, but where not relly sure if it existed or if it was made up. What we do know atlantis was located in the atlantic on a contenent known as poised named after the god poisenden the god of the sea i think. kings there were known as poisedens much like in rom they were known as ceasars. Many of you probably seen disneys atlantis and also those of you who play ecco the dolphin you will find out now how the story of glyphs and technology came into existence. They were popularized by Edgar Cayce also known as the sleeping prophet. He had done many psycic readings in the 30's about peoples past lives when eventualy he had done some readings from people who were reincarnations of atlanteans, and that many people who live today may have had past lives in atlantis. What he was able to see atlantis was many things, one of them was how all there technology were powered by special crystals, these crystals had power, and with them they created many things like things similiar to say our microwave ovens to flying machiens to even destructive weapons. he also envisioned that in atlantis the people there consisted of light and had two physical bodies of a man and woman, and that the phyiscal bodies sleapt in encasements as the combined person of light roamed. atlantis was also split up amounst themselves one part of the socieity were about letting go of material things while the other was about enhancing it, those who were more about letting go of material things had the brightest light, while those who wanted to enhance it had a weaker glow to them (rememebr the people here consisted of light.) anyways atlantis didnt just vanish immediatly it had many desructions the first came from a war between these two socieities and another coming from giant creatures which they created who wreaked havok on there lands, and a final which eventualy destroyed the whole continent. atlantis was completly gone around 12,000 BC but the story goes on....you know the sphynx and the greta pyramid, there belived to be much old then egypt, no one knows who created them, but there is a thoery. the decnedants of atlantis built them to hold an underground place known as the hall of records. edgar case the sleeping prophet  started this thoery and said around in the 1990's they would descover a passage way under the right paw of the sphynx, this actualy did happen, with sonar devices people found there is a room inside of that paw, problem is the egyptian government wont let anyone dig into it becaus ethey say its just a western myth and a bunch of crap (i.e they dont want to descover that the sphynx and great pyramid were not created by egyptians because by descovering this it would take away there great pride.) anyways its with that, that egypt may have come into existence when the people who did live there found these marvels and copyied them and even brought upon worhsip to them.man that was alot....i still got more to add but i'll trie to sum this up, i know alot of these places though and even know more then what i put here, its just hard to remember it all.I became interested in these lost ancient cities for many reasons, the main reason is everything we know of today many of the stories in the bible and stuff were remenents of atlantis and mu, the people who been there and even left those places took a little knowlege of them but at one time man was so far advanced they had to be destroyed so millions of years would pass and they would regain the wealth of power and technology, maybe these cities became advanced because of some sort of extraterrestrial intrusion, or a descovery of something so great that they destroyed it and themselves which ended the golden age.which brings me to my greatest thoery and belief, the place i come to know as Zurvan or the Tesseract.I became very interested in time travel with ecco the dolphin, im writing a story and game which will involve all this stuff combine with stuff in ecco, mu will be an important aspect to my story...the problem with coming up with a story that continues from ecco the dolphin 2 is ecco vanished into a palce known as the tides of time...what is this place? and how did ecco end up there.thats when i came across this great qoute and came up with a thoery.sorry for all the slashes there id remove them but im too lazy."There's nothing in the world as ruthless or impartial as death.All living matter ages over time and eventually dies...No matter how mighty or tiny its life force... So being alive means you're creeping closer to death with every second...But there's none of that here.No one and nothing ages. Nothing wastes away.This quiet, boundless, and beautiful world...An ideal world, straight out of a fairytale, isn't it?A place and time that belongs to no one... Res nullius...It's because this is a future that was eliminated!!!History is composed of choices and divergences.Each choice you make creates a new world and brings forth a new future.But at the same time, you're eliminating a different future with the choices you didn't make.A future denied of all existence because of a change in the past...A future that was destroyed even before it was born rests here..."this is from a game called chrono cross, the game chrono trigger is actualy alot like ecco the dolphin, but i wont go off topic about chrono trigger just read the qoute.image this qoute came from a person who was living in the tides of time, then it makes more sense, basicaly the tides of time is a place where destroyed futures go, which doesnt exclude destroyed people too. ecco was a junture in time, his existence was an anmoly, how do i come to that conclusion? well in the first ecco, ecco meets the asterite for the first time, the asterite reconizes ecco as a dolphin from a far past who stole one of his globes, problem is ecco didnt steal his globe yet. so he sends ecco back to get the globe back then sends ecco to destroy the vortex.what probably split the stream of time was what happened originaly, if ecco destroyed the time machine originaly he would of never been able to of stolen the gloibe from the asterite, but if he destroyed it i bet the globe wouldnt magicaly appear back like how in back to the future when the fuitures changed things change magicaly too, time doesnt work that way. so if ecco destroyed the time machine the asterite would still be missing that globe so ecco has no chocie but to get it somehow because its his destiny to do so, he has no choice.by stealing that globe it created two timelines, a dark future and a good future. but theres a new problem....vortex from the dark future stolen a pair of the asterites globes...and at the end of ecco 2 ecco had been in both versions of the future...in the dark future and the good future. all he has left to do was destroy the time machine which will destroy the possibility of vortex from the dark future from ever traveling back...the thing is though they already did and if the time machine was destroyed it would erase that from happening but thats not possible.but it turns out the vortex queen had used the time machine before ecco, she knew about it and when she traveld back it destroyed the possibility of a dark future. with no queen the drones basicaly wonder off aimlessly and die. so the dark future was destroyed and became non existent as well as eccos world....why eccos world? well if vortex from the dark future traveled there but the dark future doesnt exist it means both worlds will maybe be purged...but lets focus on ecco who went to a future that was eliminated...ecco was all that was left...he sued the time machine which sent him into the purgetory...that doesnt mean he was whiped form existence that means he was put into a place where all of those possibilities still exist even though the outcome has been deided. ecco was put into the tides of time so time can continue to exist....so again ecco was put into the tides of time because like the dark future which was no longer required cause it was prevented...ecco also was put into the tides of time because he was no longer needed....so to bring him back something has to happen so time will have that need for him again....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
things like that boggle my mind...thinking of such things scares me.i wounder if my "cycle breakers" fit in somhow.cycle breakers could be the destroyers of all...or do such simple tasks as ending "smaller cycles" or preventing god written "prophacys" hard to explane.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Now, I am way blank on what this is about, so I must say firsto  I am, however, sort of lost. :?  What are the other elements included and such including thier names and possibly pics if some are available. Indeed, I am curious to see how this will all turn out. Very, very cool.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
When you say, "final upgrade," Arkon, do you mean the new Arkonviox.com? Or is that forever now out of the question?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well it wont be the final skin we make for the site but it will be the final time i change the system. originaly we used html for this whole site, then we used enigma, then postnuke, now were gonna use a new and improved engima...and a new forum. i have changed forums on this site probably 5 times, and they always get corrupted.

This story will actualy be a continuation of ecco 2 tides of time. Its a very big story you should read my mu and atlantis topic to kinda get an idea.Anyhow there are seven elements who is an arc angel of death and ressurection.the other arkons are Arkanus who isnt a dolphin at all but a stingray he is an arkon of wind.then theres Nautica who is female she is the arkon of water. and Arkelon who is a dawf version of arkonviox he is the arkon of ice. and Arknovious which looks like a giant sea serpant he is the arkon of strata.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow, that's intresting.

Almost like 3 shades of balance, Good, Evil, and Neutrality. Verry well dont as well, and though I can see the FF9 comparason, Id lean more toward Demon Crest, the thing that cought in my mind when I saw this pic was the undead dragon from there.

What he was able to see atlantis was many things, one of them was how all there technology were powered by special crystals, these crystals had power, and with them they created many things like things similiar to say our microwave ovens to flying machiens to even destructive weapons. he also envisioned that in atlantis the people there consisted of light and had two physical bodies of a man and woman, and that the phyiscal bodies sleapt in encasements as the combined person of light roamed. atlantis was also split up amounst themselves one part of the socieity were about letting go of material things while the other was about enhancing it, those who were more about letting go of material things had the brightest light, while those who wanted to enhance it had a weaker glow to them (rememebr the people here consisted of light.) anyways atlantis didnt just vanish immediatly it had many desructions the first came from a war between these two socieities and another coming from giant creatures which they created who wreaked havok on there lands, and a final which eventualy destroyed the whole continent. atlantis was completly gone around 12,000 BC but the story goes on....I have always been a skeptic about psychics. But this huge theory really grasped my interests. I have always thought Atlantis was a mythical city. I just thought it was a bunch of rubble under the ocean, from an ancient city. I didn't think these ancient people had amazing technology. But what do I know? I'm only 14 years old, and very ignorant on the subject. Trying to grasp and understand the thought of such a world is difficult.I wonder if there are groups of scientists who debate about this subject. because, even after reading this, I am still skeptical.

<br />
<div id='container'>
well id love to hear i may joke around about 14 year olds and stuff but you seem to have what it takes to talk some smart stuff on the subject.i know how you feel about the psycics thingy, the thing is about edfgar cayce is his prediction of atlantis became so popular its used in many things for example again disneys atlantis and even ecco the dolphin. thats where the story of atlantis having many power crystals and glyph like things came from.

About ranks and other things.Ranks arent anything special, meaning they dont mean much they just show your status around here, when enigmas finished they will have alot of meaning and probably will become your purpose in life.anyhow here are the ranks.http//www.arkonviox.com/modules/PNphpBB2/images/userlevels/transient.gif50-150 posts this is what you get after so many posts.http//www.arkonviox.com/modules/PNphpBB2/images/userlevels/sentinel.gif500-1000 means your an official member and stalker of the forums.http//www.arkonviox.com/modules/PNphpBB2/images/userlevels/podgod.gif9000+ posts means your blackfin or equivilent.I will probably pre assign people newer levels by uping there post counts, there are some of you who been here for years and need status reconition. too bad your gettin git o.-

<div id='container'>
ha ha i loved your thoery on things there, i compared linux to islam mainly because with islam your forced to wear a type of head vail and its very strict and has very strict rules, ha ha man thuogh you could totaly write a computer literacy book, those were coo.Islam doesn't force you to do any of that.  It's the laws of the country, not the religion.  People here have very misdirected and...well that's not the exact word I wanted but it's similar...anyway people here often have very misled ideas about Islam.  We look at how things are in those countries and think it's all about religion.  But it's not.  It's about being ruled by a dictator.

I recognize the name of invader-pichu from the Pokemon Forever Club on DA.And those are kinda cute, but I think it's mostly the eyes.

Anyway, I don't want to completely change the topic.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Did anyone besides Arkon notice I was gone?  Anyway just wanted to say I'm still here, and sorry I haven't been around.  I didn't leave or anything, just had no reason to come here.  I should also mention long absences like that probably won't be uncommon for me now, but it doesn't mean I've left.And I lost my avatar....

But it doesn't look like I've missed a lot.

thats very interesting seems something important was disabled thats gonna make things a little more complex. other then that i contacted the admins today i am just waiting for a replie.i want to get it going asap. i know i put it off for months but now im serious.

<div id='container'>
i'm glad your back, i'm hoping i can make this place more interesting for everyone, i feel relly bad i let it go to waste, but  i'm working hard to get what we have functional again, even if im gonna replace it later. i will probably make special functions to handle converting the forum to enigma and other parts too.

Now it is time to destroy you with randomness.Looking to my left I see promises of a cosmic masterpiece play...for free, whereas on the right I see nothing but unhoovered landmines and an array of twelk capacitors with added reflug slippages. Which way do I turn?Towards the infamous village of Giarubiousakallai, of course! The birthplace of wind flavoured pretzels!Throughout my journeys, mostly consisting of wooden antics (not antiques) and bulbous mook creature patrols, I have noticed not 3, not 7.29, but 12 varieties of snail that can be examined upon re-entry/dismantled for use in paving various ceilings in ceramic wax. How does this alter my ability to adjust the volume of gremlin mallets? By about 48 whipperclicks, I'd say.Now, for the ultimate test. To construct a surreal virtual gelatin environment that would be able to pronounce "However, teacakes!" repeatedly and yet still arrive in time for the tomato morning, you would need no less than a kipper's amount of brillos and a bucket of nuclear pear powder.The answer is the button milk willow warp.

Lord Potty Mouth, the talking toiletThis is awful/very poor.Soon the remains of Quokk VII were injected with cornish pasties, where the cornered their own gravy faster than you could push steam through a tangled funnel. After several seconds of an unmentionable 12, a loaf-like incarnation of the degree known only as "foam gremlin saw" began to reverbarate across the kingdom at a speed of an underrated mollusc. "Pen shrivellage rug ripple" said he.

I still get this error exec, shell_exec, passthru() has been disabled for security reasons in /home/arkonvi/public_html/modules/gallery/platform/fs_unix.php on line 32Error TethysCGnew.jpg! Need help? Look in the Gallery FAQ The FAQ says Warning Verify that the binaries (NetPBM or ImageMagick) are installed correctly and are chmodded 0755 (including the directory they are in). One common installation mistake is to put the executable in a path that contains spaces. This happens often on Windows, if either package is installed in Program Files. The executables must not be installed in a path that contains spaces. Put Gallery back into configuration mode (see the tutorials earlier in the manual for details) Re-run the configuration wizard. On step 2, select the option to put Gallery into debug mode. Finish the configuration wizard and secure Gallery (this is described in the configuration wizard tutorial). Attempt to upload a picture. There will be a whole lot more debugging messages now, and it will help to diagnose the problem. Possible issues are listed below If you see any of the following messages, the solutions are listed below Error in loading shared libraries -- Indicates that your dynamic library loader can't find a library that it needs. On Linux you can add the directory containing the appropriate library to /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig -v as root to fix this. If you don't have root access to the server, either contact your host for help or download a new version of ImageMagick or NetPBM and use the new install instead.

The code does work, I've just tried it on my system.Goto the player select menu, create a new game, then enter in GYUGYUXXX (Where XXX can be anything you want.) Then hit the circle then hit triangle button twice to return to the main menu.When you reach the main menu goto level select and all the levels will be unlocked. Of course you need to have created a new game or select an existing one in order to enter it meaning this code requires a memory card.

Randomness = spam. Spam is good. Heh, I'm not good at being an idiot. Or, am I? Maybe it just comes naturally.Um, this one time, I was chewing on a pencil, and I started choking on the eraser part, in class, during a test. So I just tried not to swallow so no one would hear me choking, and, like, my eyes were all watery and I tried coughing it up, but instead I made this wierd noise...like "Eeehaaee!" And it came out! Story of my life.That wasn't funny was it? &lt;.&lt; Hey, at least you learned something from it. Don't swallow erasers. They make you choke. Choking hurts. Ow. That was GAY.  Oh, one more thing.

There is only 1 word that I can think of that rhymes with lemon:YemenIf you stab cake, you'll get attentionPart uh... 5?"Silence!" said Bucket as the ground beneath the Lord crumbled. The Insane Lemon fly out the lake (named Titicaca *laugh*), brandishing two oven-baked plates. "Have you met my friend Sour Grapes?" he spurted. Bucket turned purple and vomited out poisoned cheeseburgers, which killed him in the process. And, then baby Jesus was born... anyway back to our story. Earth exploded, dolphins lived in moon craters, women lived on Venus, men lived on Mars, lawyers lived in hell, it's all good.*laugh*

Wow, Eao, I'm really impressed.  If I wasn't so tired now, I might be more enthusiastic.  Buit you've improved a lot since the last time I saw your work, and your newer peices are just simply amazing.  Your coloring skills are just excellent, it looks really gorgeous.  Your new works just looks really amazing.  I love the orca, and the drawing of Eao that looks like some kind of Aztec or Mayan thing.  But they're all excellent.

Yeah I just checked out my gallery, half my stuff is gone, leaving only my old stuff that  I was either going to redo or clear out. Can't replace the good stuff at the moment thought, this isn't my computer. Looks like I might be a bit more active with the gallery back up though.

Many of you probably wonder where the idea of glyphs came from and how it ties with atlantis and ecco the dolphin.the answer was that story came from readings from a prophet named Edgar Cayce.I found a pretty good site about alot of this stuff, although it sometimes tends to get a little overly wacko spiratual it seems to have relly relly good information gathered from many sources about many ancient worlds like agartha, Mu, lemuria, shambhala and atlantis.http//www.crystalinks.com/edgar_cayce.htmlthis is information about edgay cayce.http//www.crystalinks.com/lemuria.htmlifnromation on mu but gets kinda crazy until you reach information on james churchwood who descovered it.

I loved it when I saw it on DA.  Your drawings are always so stunning.  I really like the lighting on this, and the colors.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's really interesting.  I never really thought about why they used glyphs like that.  It's interesting that they apparantly used crystals to encode messages and stuff like that, because that's how they were used in the games.  And I remember in one of the levels, I think in ToT, there was a room with a bunch of glyphs that said something about they created the glyphs because they knew their civilization was gonna come to an end.  Or something.  Which corresponds to what it said on that one site.  I don't know where that information came from originally, but it sounds like a bunch of mythology to me.  Not that that doesn't make it any less interesting.But where did the word glyph come from?  I didn't read all that stuff so I don't know if it was mentioned in any of those web sites.Are all of these ancient cities really the same place?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You know, I have heard of using crystals for healing and meditation, thought cleansing, sort of that new-age stuff.....but for record keeping and teleportation, etc, that sounds more like myth. And as far as the hollow earth theory, you don't have to look much farther than the launching of space shuttles and probes to disprove that. All very interesting, though.Tethys--the level with all the Glyphs that you mentioned was 'the Library' from Ecco 1.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I was just saying, there's more evidence of the earth not being hollow. It is a very interesting concept however. Really we don't know what is in the center of the earth, most speculation says its molten but then again no one's ever been there. And it just goes to show how little we really know about our own miserable little planet.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually scientist's think the inner core is solid metal, due the pressure.  The mantle has two layers, one that's flowing solid (kinda like silly putty or something) and the other that's partly molten.  Than the outer core is molten.  And the inner core is solid.  Of course no one's been inside the earth to prove this, but the evidence comes from certain kinds of technology, as well as volcanoes and lava rocks and things like that.  If the earth were hollow, how would you explain volcanoes and such.  And it just doesn't seem like it would be possible, not with the way we think planets are created.  And I can't imagine how a hollow planet could be created even if we were wrong.

After battling with at least three seperate computers, I managed to update my gallery. Deleted some older stuff I wasn't pleased with, posted some new stuff....Only four or five new pieces there at the moment, I need to scan a bunch more stuff and will do that when I have the free time.....Anyway, if you're interested in seeing what I have it's hereCheers.

Although, if the Earth was "hollow", wouldn't it implode from gravity or something?I agree with Tethys, how would volcanos exist without a solid Earth?Everything is truly a mystery. We don't know exactly how the dinosaurs died. Besides some species that were considered "exstinct" resurfaced.

Wow Mutaclone, I haven't seen any of your masterpieces in a long time. Great job.  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Love the way the light reflects off the dolphin's bodies. Very...realistic.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i can see you guys didnt research anything about hollow earth thoery, basicaly there is still layers even a lava layer where the plates move over, but deeper inside is the hallowness meaning it had a thick layer but still a hallow portion, kinda like a golfball without the wierd core.its belvied that earth began as a giant gas like star that emerged from the sun and as it cooled parts of it became solid while the inner part is still cooling but also extremly hot, this leaves a layer around the core and like the sun probably has eruptions that burst throgh the surface and cause our volcanoes.anyways enough explaining for now.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have to say you got some nice stuff in there, nice to see people maknig use of the gallery again, and seeing new stuff in this forum.
</div>

This better not mess up again...I have this set to log me in automatically.  So I was browsing the site, when I happened to glance towards the bottom and noticed it said I was logged in as EccoCode!  So I logged out, and logged back in as Tethys.  It was fine, but then when I tried to post something, it posted it as EccCode! &gt;.&lt;  So I immediately deleted the message.  And tried again.  Hopefully it doesn't do the same thing this time, but if it does I might just have to post without logging in, if it will let me.So what in the hell is going on here?  It's not like I am trying to do this deliberatly.  I put in Tethys as the username and my password.  So I don't know why this is happening.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, while it is an interesting theory and all, I still find the current scientific theories to be more plausable, considering the evidence.  Not saying it isn't possible, though.  Who knows.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Those are all awesome, especially that last one.  You really do have a knack for that kind of thing.  Keep it up!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Two things might of happened, i been working on new enigma and messing with how postnuke works on the site and changed some session crap thingies so they could log me in as other people, but it wasnt working, it turns out whenever you come to my site a cookie is made with a special code. what might of happened was i accidently changed tethys to log in as eccocode or her browser generated a code that happened to be eccocodes code and logged her in as eccocode. its very rare something like that happens, but dont worry it shouldnt happen again.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well it seems to be fine now.  That is kinda weird though.But it's not like I'm gonna snoop around people's private messages or pretend that I'm that person or anything like that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
trust me if you did there isnt anythnig interesting in those anyways. and being that its eccocodes account you can just imagine what its about "wow i found a dollar on the ground im so cool, *dies*"

you live in a giant mittin n.n

woah.....thats just uber screwy. Poor Theth..now she is Tethies-code

trust me if you did there isnt anythnig interesting in those anyways.You can see everyone's private messages then?

<div id='container'>
yes.

Oh man, that happened to me too! I saw myself loged in under Tethys. I went ahead and loged out right then.  :?

yes.Scary.

<br />

why again its not like anyone talks about anything good. besides keep track of everything on this site and all its systems i have to make sure its all worknig and functional, and people arent using my private message system to attack the site, or harass members.

I found this link which actualy gives how plato described atlantis and what its origins relly are, its a myth sorta, but it ties into ancient greek Atlantis - The isle of Atlas. And the continent of posied.http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/atlantis.htmlThe story of the Isle of Atlantis first occurs in Plato's two dialogues the "Timaeus" and the "Critias." Plato's story centers on Solon, a great Greek legislator and poet who journeyed to Egypt some 150 years earlier. While in the Egyptian city of Sais Solon received the story of Atlantis from priests. The priests respected Solon's reputation and cordially welcomed him. They also respected the Athenians, whom they regarded as kinsmen, because they believed their deity Neith to be the same deity as the Greeks called Athena. Therefore, she was believed to be the patroness and protector of both Greece and Egypt.The story that the priests told Solon was unknown to him. According to ancient Egyptian temple records the Athenians fought an aggressive war against the rulers of Atlantis some nine thousand years earlier and won.These ancient and powerful kings or rulers of Atlantis had formed a confederation by which they controlled Atlantis and other islands as well. They began a war from their homeland in the Atlantic Ocean and sent fighting troops to Europe and Asia. Against this attack the men of Athens formed a coalition from all over Greece to halt it. When this coalition met difficulties their allies deserted them and the Athenians fought on alone to defeat the Atlantian rulers. They stopped an invasion of their own country as well as freeing Egypt and eventually every country under the control of the rulers of Atlantis.Shortly after their victory, even before the Athenians could return home, Atlantis suffered catastrophic earthquakes and floods until it disappeared beneath the sea. All of the brave men were swallowed up in one day and night of horror according to legend. This is why the Egyptians were ever grateful to the Athenians.Also in the story Plato gives is a history of Atlantis that shows how the rulers eroded to such a state were they wanted to conquer everyone. This history had been recorded by Solon in notes that were handed down through his family.According to Solon's notes the history of Atlantis began at the beginning of time. It was then that the immortal gods divided the world among themselves and each ruled their proportion. The god Poseidon received Atlantis, an island larger the Libya and Asia combined. He chose for a wife the mortal woman Cleito, and with her begun the royal family of Atlantis.Poseidon built Cleito's home on a high hill at the very center of the island. The home overlooked a fertile plain bordered by the sea. For his beloved wife's protection Poseidon surrounded her house with five concentric rings of water and land. He carved the rings with the ease and skill of a god. He made hot and cold springs come from the earth. With the development of a future city his descendants never lacked for water.Cleito bore Poseidon ten sons, five sets of boys. Atlas the first son of the first set of twins, was made king over the vast territory by his father. His brothers were appointed princes and each ruled over a large section of the territory that was distributed to him. The most valuable section of the kingdom remained his mother's home on the hilltop and the land surrounding it. This was given to Atlas. Atlas himself had many sons with the succession of the throne always passing to the eldest son.For generations Atlantis remained peaceful and prospered. Almost all of the population's needs were met from the island's mines, fields and forests. Anything that the kingdom did not produce was imported. This was possible because a channel was eventually built which transversed all the rings from the ocean to the center of the kingdom, or the acropolis. On this stood the royal palace near the original home of Poseidon and Cleito. Each succeeding king tried to out do his predecessor in building a greater kingdom. Finally the splendid city Metropolis and the outer city of Atlantis existed behind a great outer wall.Poseidon sat down laws for Atlantis that the rulers were to fellow. The ruling body was to meet regularly. It was to consist of ten rulers that represented the first rulers -- Atlas and his nine brothers -- who reigned with absolute power of life and death over their subjects. These meeting occurred in the temple of Poseidon where the first rulers inscribed the laws on a pillar of orichalcum. First, as required by ancient ceremony, pledges were exchanged. Then a sacred bull was captured and killed. The body was burned as a sacrifice to the god. Then the blood was mixed with wine and poured over the fire as a act of purification for each man. The rulers were served wine in golden cups, each poured a libation over the fire and swore by oath to give judgment according to the inscribed laws. When ending his vow each drank his wine and dedicated his cup to the temple. This was followed by a dinner that preceded the rulers putting on magnificent blue robes in which they judged matters concerning the kingdom according to Poseidon's laws.As long as they judged and lived by Poseidon's laws they and the kingdom prospered. When the laws began to be forgotten trouble began. More of the rulers eventually began marrying mortals and started acting like foolish humans. Soon pride overtook the rulers who soon began grasping for greater power. Then Zeus saw what had happened to the rulers. They had abandoned the laws of the gods and acted in an evil coalition as men. He assembled all the gods of Olympus around him and was to pronounce judgment on Atlantis. This is where Plato's story stops.Whether Plato intended to end his story of Atlantis so abruptly or whether he intended to extend it no one knows. Just as no one knows whether Plato believed in the real existence of the island or whether it was purely a mythical kingdom. Many have said they believe that Plato believed in the island's existence because he exerted so much detail in its description, while others reject this by claiming since the story was purely fiction Plato could put in as much detail as he wanted, it does not prove a thing. Also in doubt is the time period of the story. Solon writes the island existed 9000 years before. This would place the time period in the Early Stone Age. In this period it is hard to imagine the type of agriculture, architecture and sea navigation as described in the story. One explanation for this time period inconsistency is that Solon misinterpreted the Egyptian symbol for "100" for "1000." If this be the case then Atlantis would have existed 900 years before. This would place the Atlantians in the Middle Bronze Age where they would possess the tools and equipment needed for the development described within the story.To collaborate this 900 year theory there is geological evidence showing that roughly about 1500 BCE there was a gigantic volcanic eruption which caused half of the island to sink into the sea. Also a lost city has been said to have sunk in the Bay of Naples. At the time several rich and luxurious seaside resorts were located in the area. In the retelling of the story of Atlantis it is easy to see how one of these cities could be associated with it. The story is still being told which enthralls hundreds, as archaeological digs are conducted to unearth evidence of the real Atlantis. Until then the myth remains.

Oh man, that happened to me too! I saw myself loged in under Tethys. I went ahead and loged out right then.  :?So you were me and I was you.  Interesting...Argh!  I went to post in here and it happened AGAIN! &gt;.&lt;  Something weird is going on here.But then that's a pretty obvious statemtent.

I actually read the whole thing this time.The story about Poseidon kinda contradicts what I've read about Greek mythology.  He was ruler of the sea, so it makes sense he would rule over an island like Atlantis.  But his wife was a naiad (se nymph) called Amphitrite, and there's even a story about how he sent the dolphin named Delphineus to bring her to him so that he could marry her.  Also, Atlas is the name of a titan, who was said to hold up the earth, or the sky in some versians.  It was that Atlas that gave his name to the Atlas mountains.  However, mythology does often chance over time, and sometimes names are changed or given over to different characters.  And it doesn't mean Atlantis itself wasn't real in some form or another.   Though I do kind of have to wonder if Cleito only had sons, than where did the rest of the people come from if they didn't marry anyone outside Atlantis...I think the stories about Atlantis are probably mostly legend, but it's possible that they are all based off an actual place.  Sometimes people or places become attached to stories and legends and are thus transformed into something completely different.  And names are often changed, especially in older times when every group of people that encountered a place would have a different name for it.   And they gave different names to the people they encountered as well.I was just thinking that Atlantis is actually kinda similar to Avalon.  Avalon was a magical island inhabited by faery people--referring to people that were descended from the gods, althogh there are different versians of who they were exactly.  And like Atlantis, Avalon eventually dissappeared.  Although as far as I know there was no volcano associated with it, and it apparantly just disappeared without a trace.Chances are anything with a similar story to Atlantis is really the same place, just with different names and other variations.  The mythology of peoples of Europe were all similar in many ways, and there are even some stories that reach overseas.  So a story such as the one of Atlantis could easily have spread to other areas in the same way.  And it it was based on a real place, different groups of people could have seen the same place and created similar stories.

Actually I didn't realize any of the Greek gods had more than one wife.  I know some of the Celtic gods did, but I have never read any mention of any more than one wife for any Greek god.  They did have a lot of affairs, though.  I've read in some versains where Zuess would ask someone to "marry" him but it was usually just a one-time affair, so I figured it was just a figure of speech or something.  Also it's possible they could have different wives in different versians, or they could have had different names...or something.  But you could be right.  I don't pretend to be an expert.I should read up on these other cities..

New Enigma is basicaly my project to replace postnuke (which runs this site) and phpbb (the forum) and create my own site and forum. I also plan to incoroporate things from other sites like live journal and deviant art creating a super website. But with all that its still not enough so im asking you guys for ideas, what can i do to make the forum better? or site or anything? is there something you hate about this site that needs improvement? is there something you seen omewhere else that we dont have yet? let me know i need you guys help.New Enigma is almost fully alive, but it still wont be done for several months, but its almost awake and alive. so now i need to know so i can incoporate it into the core.

The only thing I could recommend is more flash stuff, like the yogoat thing you did long ago.Crestoe made those.

I just thought i'd ramble a bit, I'm pretty bummed out I won't be taking a trip to brazil this summer, I don't relly get along with you know who anymore, after we broke up things took a good nose dive, i relly wish i was better at getting over things like this, i was the one who initiated the breakup since i was kinda noticing things werent working out and it was only logical, althuogh kinda a bummer cause they worked out for me but it isnt always about what i want. Part of me is so angry, so angry at her and i just wish she would go away, while the other part thinks logicaly and just wished things could of worked or at least forget about it and move on. It wont be hard moving on but it sucks that i have to turn my back again on anothe rperson, i couldnt be friends with her at all, for some reason we built up alot of hate towards each other, and theres always been something wrong with me. i just hate being the one whos weak cause i'm not a weak person im more confident and stronger then alot of people but for some reason whenever it involves love i always break apart. anyways i hate to think i wasted all that time, i relly tried hard to make it work, all i got is these books on portugese and i was thinking id learn it anyways, maybe even make a part on my site that will be in portugese just so i can practice with it. i had a cool idea to also have like a section in spanish too.You know whats funny you can have anyone you want in this world, many of you probably were in love with people you couldnt have, but a piece of advice is even when you do have them its never ment to be even if you managed to get them to love you for a small second, cause if fate has other plans for you then you have to follow through with them, Had i not done what i did i probably would have been unhappy and maybe this happened for a reason, still its relly relly hard to let go...i wanted it to work, but i couldnt be miserable and let the other person be miserable too.Anyways just thuoght id ramble and see if anyone has some good advice and see if anyone could help convince me im not insane cause for some reason something just doesnt feel right about all this, for some reason i feel like a horrible person.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
not a bad idea fargali thuoght id let people know new enigma probably wont be done for a very long time, the current system we use called postnuke consists of probably 70 files of code, and is right now alot more stable then new enigma, new enigma requires alot of work, correction, and detail until its fully ready to come to life, i have been working on it alot, it will get done and is coming out very well but this is a very big project and i assume it will take serveral months to complete, i wont add it up until its completly finished until the forums made the new profile manager made and its perfected and bug and exploit free.but thats why i asked for advice i know alot of you guys visit many sites and may have seen things that havent been done on other sites, if so lets incoporate them into enigma. i promise you, you will not be disappointed, i know this will bring alot of life back into this site, and i know what the people want, and your opinions matter here cause the more i address these things the more perfect this will become.

*gives you a hug* Breakups suck. Being as I'm still with my first boyfriend (been 8 months now, don't know how I've managed it), I haven't been through one, but I've lost plenty of friends in the same manner. In that I never talk to them anymore, and in some cases would like to kill a few.All I can say is that (this may sound cliche-ish and stupid) you'll meet someone eventually who you'll get along perfectly with. I never thought I'd date in the first place, yet here I am. Well, I was never good at giving advice, so pardon if I made myself sound like an incompetent.

For the last few months my site has been listed at the bottom of google on page number 60 now im happy to say i got it back on the first page on number 8. I dont know the stance on other search engines but i can hope to say its progressing up there as well.Basicaly i did some little internet changes in the description of this site to do that but i think postnuke holds this site back some cause of how stupid links look...google hates thatexample http://www.arkonviox.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=posting&amp;mode=newtopic&amp;f=1anyways just thuoght id share that its been at the bottom for 7 months now because i been kinda neglecting things, but hopefuly that will help us get more people here.when new enigmas done i have plans for more changes to help this site become a little more dolphin whale oriented too but still keep the style and ecco ness as well, i just thuoght if we started doing dolphin whale artwork and fanfiction more it opens this site up to more visitors, lets face it ecco fans are a dying breed but we can change that. best of all when enigmas done i get to start my game, which i have said i been going to start a million times but please bear with me i have been learning new things all the time which have been changing it.anyways thuoght id share that.also i still need more ecco links so please help me find some good stuff anything you can find reviews you name it.

thats not bad, im actualy interested, i had done the same thing, i kinda stopped talknig and neglected alot of friends cause of my relationship and it kinda put me where i am now.I cut off a friend of mine who was an ex i knew for 5 years because (the girl ) didnt like her, this ex had done me wrong in the past but i didnt want to breakup my friendship i wasnt interested in her anyways i just wanted to be happy with my then current girlfriend, i had done so much for this girl and she was very appreciative at first then got relly careless, in a way i smothered her but i relly wanted to be better for her, i asked her all the time and was willing to do anything, but she didnt know what was wrong with herself, she just seemed unhappy for no reaosn and not interested, all she wanted to do was her own thing and play. I dont want her to sound bad though cause i always got angry with her for stupid things and i didnt want to, i relly wanted to be a better person but no matter how hard i tried i couldnt make her happy like i did in the begining.i was her first boyfriend, even thuogh it was stupid net related. in the end she said alot of hurtful things like: your first love is never your true love, anyways for you mutaclone i hope you can prove this ignorance wrong, i refuse to belive that, cause if im ever to be anyone elses first boyfriend i refuse to belvie it wont work.i dont want to sound all rambly but i need to talk about it it just bothers me and i dont know what ive done wrong.

Is this guy for real?The only part I agreed with was about the vampires, because I have to agree it sounds pretty stupid.  Although I've never met a vampire or even seen one as far as I know.  We have a few  Jr. High students dressing in Goth clothes, but even that's not very common here.  But it seems like it's about the same thing.But everything else there, I can't beleive he's actually serious.  Because I can't imagine how anyone could even think that way.

If there's one thing I can do better than anything else it's listen....or read, in this case.Talking helps. I have one close friend who I know I can talk to about anything (and you CAN NOT LIE to that man about anything....he sees right through it. I've tried....) which is a great improvment to when I used to be a pathetic depressed wreck with no one to talk to. The thing about 'your first love is not your true love' just isn't true. Of course I'm not really old enough to know much about it, but I'm more mature than most people my age. And to make a relationship work, you really have to work at it. Trust me....My b/f has a real problem holding his temper alot of the time--I had the exact problem, but I ended up getting over it. I've learned to be patient with him when he's mad, let him calm down and then talk. Though I'm worried in the future he may have trouble keeping a job if he can't calm down his temper....And trust me. I know all about trying to help people....I'm not that good at it. Mostly because the people I've tried to help never let me. I had a friend once who was pathetically depressed and suicidal....and try as I did to talk to him about it, he blew me off. Sometimes people just refuse to accept help.And now I feel like I'm rambling as well, but I have trouble putting thoughts into words at times.

......Well, I agree with some of his statements. Like #1 the thing about abortion. Each group pisses the other off and no one gets anything done. And the thing about punk 14 years olds pretending to be vampires and acting all morbid. Mostly because I have a 14 year old sister who does just that (sort of) But I confess. I like vampires.

yeah i have a problem with holding my tempter, but i think it was because of the distance thing and the fact i could never be with her that amplified it. i did trie very hard though to keep cool and be patient i relly wish i was better with it, i hope your boyfriend is able to find a way to cope with it, anger can cause us to do stupid things, but as long as he can make you happy and you enjoy each other you will do just fine. it sucks when you cant even make them feel good anymore, when it all becomes routine, we talked everyday, i guess we started to get sick of each other.

I've never had a real relationship offline so I wouldn't know.  I just think it'd be easier because you could actually do things together, and just enjoy being with the person.  Instead of having to always come up with a conversation.  Although RPing works, too.  But it's not the same without that physical contact.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yeah, it took me a while to learn the differences between a real relationship and an online one. i had to learn through a friend whos a girl what love is relly about, you can have nothnig in common with a person: on the web this usualy fizzles out, in real life you can make anything you want of it cause you can always find a great way to have a good time together and relly feel it, but, theres still so much i dont know....im a person whos spent most of his life living in the darkness watching others but never joining in cause of a strange difference i still dont understand.

Yay, I can breathe. ._.*ahem* *koff* "Mew.  Mew." (kitten sounds) &gt;^..^&lt;Flash would be cool.  You should have a nifty flash intro.Also, I think you should have contests.  The art contest, of course, but other kinds of things too.  Maybe.And maybe you could like give away free stuff every do often.  Because DA gives out free stuff.  They did it for they're third year...thing.  They gave out subscriptions and Wacom tablets and stuff like that.  But then you have to buy the stuff to do that.  So you gotta make money somehow.  Hmmm...Just some random ideas.  I just felt like I had to say something. ._.;I can't beleive how much I've been around here today...e.e  I need to go to bed.

http "always, every, all, everything, nothing," and "never." Actually most of the things I say I hate on my site, I really don't care about strongly in real life. Animals and animal rights for example. I just don't give a shit either way. So why do I say animals are only good for eating? Well, for two reasons. First of all, because they are. And second, just to piss off animal rights activists--those crazy bastards that protest McDonalds (people should be protesting McDonalds, not because of animal rights, but because their food is shitty). when i finish my projects for this site and have more free time i probably will.

thats some good ideas, crestoe and i have been talking about doing a store where he'd design t shirts and stuff like that, i also been wanting to get crestoe to do a relly kick ass animated intro page of some sort. i relly wish i had his art talent, my game would of taken off sooner if i was the one making the sprites, the only way i can get him to do stuff in a hurry is if i pay him, some of this stuff hes done for me is a big laod of work. but yeah sounds cool we do need more contests and stuff i relly want to do another art contest and contact people like i did last time, cretsoe drifts around alot of art sites so i know alot of artists i just seen im sure i can pull in for this.

You should have a nifty flash intro.CRUSH! KILL! MAIM! DESTROY!Listen, people. Flash intros are an abomination unto the WWW.

Arkon, if your aim is to attract surfers, you need to make information on this site as easily available to them as possible. Making them click on an extra link before they even get to your site proper is that much interest lost, making them wait through an intro, no matter how cool it might be, is even more.Well, that is, if it's not idiots that you want to attract. Just ask yourself this question: Do I want people who like watching Flash intros to post on my forum? I don't like watching Flash intros.

yeah i have a problem with holding my tempter, but i think it was because of the distance thing and the fact i could never be with her that amplified it. i did trie very hard though to keep cool and be patient i relly wish i was better with it, i hope your boyfriend is able to find a way to cope with it, anger can cause us to do stupid things, but as long as he can make you happy and you enjoy each other you will do just fine. it sucks when you cant even make them feel good anymore, when it all becomes routine, we talked everyday, i guess we started to get sick of each other.Uh... I hope your not talking to me.First of all, I'm a straight MALE.Second of all, my FRIENDS broke up, I've never had a girlfriend yet.

Ok, anyway...I was reading an article in a Science thing, when I found this tidbit of info...Researchers were testing if Dolphins can recognize thereselves in a mirror by marking them with markers (some just water). Every marked dolphin rushed to the shiny part of their tank trying to see their "mark". One dolphin even flipped underwater many times to see his "fake" mark.Well... I doesn't say how that's recognization is part of that but it's still interesting.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's so CUTE! Hee hee. I like it.

HA! I thought of something.....You should have the Quick Replies at the bottom of the forum page thingies....I hate having to load up a whole new page sometimes to reply something. Other than that.....I had one other thing but I can't remember it.....I'll get back to you on it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
O_o;.....I'm nowhere. Ecco fans may be a dying breed, sadly.....but then there are those loyal people who stick around here all the time. We just need to publisize.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I never had a real online relationship.....I had a close friend online...don't know what happened to him, he either killed himself or got shipped off to an asylum....But yeah. Online, you can't really do much together other than talk. RL is so much better for a real relationship. The temper thing....I'm not even sure how I got over it, and I'm still not over it completely. That's why so many people used to avoid me....I was prone to blowing up on them for no apparent reason.....
</div>

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It sounds more like they're just interested in the mark.  How do they know they can recognise themselves?  They should try showing them different photographs and have the dolphin pick the photo of itself.  Or something.  But honestly, if you never saw your own face before, how could you recognize yourself?  It wouldn't matter how intelligent you were.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's actually the most true thing I've heard for awhile.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*pats you on the back*i'm sorry there my little fishy friend lol  oopscrywinkrolltwisted:
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yeah the forums been damaged thats why you havent seen it up, i dont know why it stopped working i think it has something to do with the "skin" but in any case when new enigmas up a whole new forum will be built and i'll make a quick replie. yeah thanks keep these comnig cause i'll more likely incoporate them into new enigma.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the first reaction would be to be scared then after that a close examination then playing around and looking at yourself in the mirrior. you know what i loved i used to have one of them mini goats and whenever she seen herself in the mirrior she would trie to head butt it, it was pretty funny.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
man i been looking at maddox's page too much that i had a dream i met him and he told me i should do a page like his too, i'm so tempted i dont want to scare anyone here though i can be twisted and illogicaly insane too o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i noticed the more active we are and the more we talk about stuff here the more people who join, eccos kinda a tough topic, id be more like coh if i could with decussions and stuff but honestly i researched alot on ecco and know more about the storyline then anyone on the net, for some odd ball reaosn im too interested in my own idea now cause i worked so much on it. i kinda hope others start doing there own storie ideas and follow my sorta lead, ive watched and alot of people have good ideas they just need to be put forward a story about dolphins and such is very unique and rare to find but you can relly do alot with them and when i get my idea down i'll prove that soon enough.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
mutaclone i'll trie to see whats wrong with yourt gallery.friecco: o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
More research...Also in the Science thing...Dolphins (as well as prarie dogs) can communicate very well. They both have different clicks and sounds for different things.This is true because I've heard that penguins (and other birds) have specific sounds that only they make.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
you know like dolphins bats have sonars too, i was kinda having a decussion with my brother about telepathy, i belvie telepathy is a high frequencey sonar that sounds like a high pitch noise, that we can barley hear and that sort. meaning thats how i think telepathy works.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I "write" a lot of "software stories", I just never finish them. ( I mean, I can't actually do them yet, but I come up with a LOT of ideas.)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
O.o;;;;;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That makes a lot of sense. Like how dogs can hear a dog whistle yet we can't.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's good and it does make a good avatar.*beats eccocode over the head with his fist*stop repeating what i said.Sorry sir. I'll try to pick what I saw more carefully.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
id have to do something like this if i ment for that.*puts tethys safly in a diamond box for safe keeping*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what are you talknig about, i can hear a dog whistle.anyways thats also the same for wireless internet its just a radio signal.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You could have an art contest AND a poetry contest.  You know?  I mean you couldn't really put them together because the art will always win out every time, since people are too lazy to read.  But if you had a seperate contest for poetry/prose, that gives the writers a chance.  And then maybe you could make the contest a regular thing, and then people could do different things each time or have different participants.  Yeah.  I thought of some stuff last night, but I can't remember any of it now.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
just copy what mutaclone says, and mix it with something someone else said then you got something completly new and unique.now...*makes eccocode bow on his knees to tethys picture*bow o.o      P  lollolololol
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, well then never mind...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
that wouldnt be too bad, and i think it would help us get more poetry up. the only reaosn why i think people neglect the section is cause ive neglected maknig it work better, and those nice little bugs that are hidden in it that i knew about but never fixed...but the section works....it could just work better...anyhow you know the drill -&gt; new enigma blah blah in there.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
:(
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yay! o.oOh wait, you can't hear me.  I'm inside of a mitten inside of a box inside of a mitten. x.o;Oh yeah...Since Ark ain't doing it...*opens mitten, opens box, opens mitten*Be free!*Tethys drops out*Oops...  :PI'm FREE!  *runs around*Well it's a problem that there hasn't been anything since DOTF, and also the fact that there was so much space between the old games and DOTF.  A lot of people played it never having heard of Ecco before.  It's kinda along the same lines as Phantasy Star, a lot of people played PSO without ever hearing of the old games.  But even before PSO came out there were, and still are, some pretty good PS sites.  Though not very many.  But then they released Phantasy Star Collection on the GBA, and are making remakes of the first, second, and fourth games.  Now if Ecco could get some remakes, or re-releases, that would be helpful.  I'm sure there are people out there who were fans of the old Ecco games long ago, and just need to be reminded of it.What we need is some good fan fics.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I can actually hear a dog whistle, too.But dogs do hear much higher frequencies than we do.I already knew that about dolphins, though.But research has been indicating that animals communicate in more advanced ways then we previously thought.  Like elephents actually make sounds at a lower frequency than what we can hear, and they have many different sounds that they make that all mean different things.Basically it shows animals are probably more intelligent than we give them credit for.  Sure they don't go around building machines or anything, but they don't have need for anything like that.  And some animals do build stuff.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yeah, i still think there is alot of ways to bring life back to this site, when we had the art contest it relly did draw alot of people in, the only thing that scared them away was my neglect for it when we started it then canceled it then started it again, i was having problems with the site then im sitll having them now but even how the site is now i'll do what i can to make it better as it is, and even update, even if new enigma will replace it eventualy.i think theres alot of dolphin artists out ther ewho'd like this site, alot of people who would love to do dolphin related ficts but we just havent fully tapped into it, if only i could work on this faster i relly wish this stuff was easyier but it takes time to do the detail but im not ready to give up anytime soon and we have plenty of time.

*smacks head*dood......okDolphins, Apes and humans, over time can reconive them self in a mirror. that is a sign of intellegence, self reconision.young babies cannot reconise themself, they will paw/bat/grap the mirror image, to try and play with the other babie.Chimps will do this for a few hourse or so, untill the see that "hey he/she touched her lip and I am too?" also if they wear a blanket like a "hat" the'll see the "other chimp" has one too, even if then they relaize theres only one blanket.

<div id='container'>
I'm not saying they can't do it, I'm just saying if you never saw a mirror before how could you recognise yourself if you're seeing one for the first time.  But I didn't mean to imply that they couldn't learn, or figure it out for themselves.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Arkon...if you're having dreams about some guy telling you to do stuff....and then you actually do it...Well, all I can say is that doesn't sound very healthy.You sure it's not just the voices in your head?

I don't have much time on my hands nowadays.

Or actually "was" isn't exactly correct because it didn't have a name back then, it's just a name the scientists called it.  And they probably got the name from the same place I did.

one apon a time there was a princess named tootie. Her kingdome is in termoil with neghboring termoil.  Perviously in centureys past they were at war with the next most prolific kingdom, but they made a contract. Tootie had to marry the prince. Tootie was a true individual, she was kind, pretty and had humor. The only thing thouh is she had terrible flautance. Tootie didn't let this hold her back she traind every day to be the best queen she could, even with some poots and toots, she'd stride with books on her head, practice the harpisacord and study diplomacy. Even if her constant breaking wind somtimes broke her consitration.  The day came when Tootie learnt that she was being used as a political object, this broke her heart and made her loose confidance in herself...now shes just barter to get a past advercasy to join forces!? Never! Tootie sobed and sobed all day and night, her studies failed and her apperance looked as bad has her gas was. She kept on thinking of this prince as a stuck up fop, alhough the idea of marrying a sexy man was titliating, it still unerved her to no end.  "I'm only 13 she cried, this lechurchus feind must be some 34 year old pompus basterd" Her fists pounded the mattres as the sorrowfull rain pounded the earth.The day finnaly came when she was meeting her life-mate to be.  Tootie scuffled down the isle with her head tilted down to hide her tears.  When she reached the alter she sniffed and sniffled with sadness.  Then she sniffed the air......"what in gods name is that odor?" she thought "it smells like burning Minks and ripe cheeze" when she looked up there, in royal garb was a ganngly pencil necked skinky prince....they looked each other in the eyes, and pooting with excitment she fell in love with him instantly, the prince also sought reffuge in her passions.  and from that day on they made a new kingdom based on true love.the moral of this story is to be yourself

I didn't notice this topic before.  But it looks like it's strayed way off the original topic.There are apparantly some characters I never saw.  I never saw any of the other characters in DotF.  I only got about halfway through the first game.  And I thought I had played through all of the levels in ToT using the level select code, but maybe I missed some.  Before coming here, I never knew about any character called Blackfin, and I thought Tara was only in Ecco, Jr. (although in the manual it said Tara was the Orca).So I'm really only familiar with Trellia, the Asterite, and the Big Blue.  And there wasn't much to go by as for what anyone's personality was like.  But I guess I would say Trellia just cuz I like the design.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I would say those crab things you face in The Library in Ecco 1. They popped out of now where and there was no space to kill them! Either that or the porcupine fish that like to pop out too and chase you where ever you go. ugh...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
tethys was actualy a greek god if i remember right and also the name of one of i think saturns moons but i might be wrong.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
blackfin and tara didnt relly have and unique looks to themselves they were just mentioned by name in ecco 2.i think i can name all the ecco characters out of the whole series excluding defender of the future.Ecco the dolphin, the Asterite, Blackfin, Tara, Big Blue, Trellia, The Vortex Queen, Medusa, the Moray, The Globe Holder, Eight Arms. Those are basicaly characters that had names throuhgout the game. all that i can think of.

the artic spiders, they have to be the most annoying, hell the animators were so lazy they didnt even make them animated they just made the sprite and made a still image move and follow you, kinda weak if you ask me.

Hm. Yes, the damn trilobites were annoying...you couldn't get away from them without having to fight them. I personally thought the pufferfish from ToT were pretty annoying as well. They just sort of popped out of the walls in swarms....And the moray eels from Moray Abyss...more particularly the giant red one that came out of the shell at the end of the chasm....gr....

As for the giant medusa, that's just what it is...not it's name.  The term medusa refers to the adult stage of a jellyfish, or something like that.  Same goes for the moray, that's just a species name.  And I figured "eight arms" was just what they call octopi, the same way they call sharks "hungry ones" and dolphins "singers".And you forgot Kitnee.

tethys was actualy a greek god if i remember right and also the name of one of i think saturns moons but i might be wrong.Tethys is a titaness, that is a female titan.  She was married to the titan called Oceanus.  As I have mentioned more than once in the past.  And yes, it is also the name of one of Saturn's moons.  But I got the name from Greek mythology--I hadn't heard of anything else with the name at that time.Scientists are always naming stuff after Greek and Roman gods.  And some from other mythologies as well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I dunno, Medusa COULD be an adult stage of a jellyfish, but I think it means a giant jellyfish. Giant tentecles=Paralyzing ("Stone") Just my guess.

I didn't consider the globe holder to even be a living creature so I never would have thought of it as a character.  An interesting series of arguments you have here Teth, however if you look atthe globe holder, it does look rather organic, and the Vortex do mix organic matter with mechines, the prior more then the latter in most respects. :?

I dont belive in god so only the last two have any meaning to me.but i do belvie this: without time there would be nothing, because it was time that allowed everything to take form and exist. if god is to be anything god would be time cause creation didnt exist until time started moving.

http://www.arkonviox.com/arkonviox/MyPicts/Set102_01.jpgThats my new cat, he's missing an ear cause a dog attacked him, it also made him loose his voice so Mr. Pugglesworth is a mute, when he meows its just silence or maybe a wisper, which i wish all my cats had cause they can be fucking annoying. right now i only have two the other cat is crestoes.i named him mr pugglesworth but his real name is fluffy. anyways i was bored i thought id show of a picture of my new cat o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
that's sad about his ear, and that he lost his voice. I also have a cat, it likes to keep me up at night when i'm trying to go to bed and it will scrach my carpet. but he's a good cat.

<div id='container'>
3000?!?   Holy crap.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't know about that whole time thing.  Only living creatures experience time, and humans are the only ones that actually measure it.  But time doesn't have any meaning out in space, or anywhere where there isn't any life.  Of course I guess it depends on how exactly you define life.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Awwww! ^_^  He's so cute!  Looks like he's got a bit of attitude, though.  Heh.  A perfect fit for you, Arkon.  When you say his real name is Fluffy, do you mean that was his name before you got him?  DId you get him from the pound?I dunno what I'll do when my cats are gone.  My dad doesn't want any more cats after that.  So I won't be able to have another cat until I've moved out and made enough money to get one.  But I love cats so much.  I've had them my entire life.  I don't think I could live without a cat.  ;_;

I dunno, Medusa COULD be an adult stage of a jellyfish, but I think it means a giant jellyfish. Giant tentecles=Paralyzing ("Stone") Just my guess.Well I wasn't sure exactly.  I couldn't really remember, except that a medusa jellyfish has a certain shape to it.  I was thinking for some reason that it was the adult stage, btu i don't really remember.I didn't consider the globe holder to even be a living creature so I never would have thought of it as a character.  An interesting series of arguments you have here Teth, however if you look atthe globe holder, it does look rather organic, and the Vortex do mix organic matter with mechines, the prior more then the latter in most respects. :?Well it does look kinda organic, but I hadn't actually thought it was alive.  But, still, even if it's alive, that doesn't qualify it as a character.  Plants are alive, but you wouldn't consider a plant a character.  Even if it played a significant role.

She married her brother Oceanus and had over 3000 children by him, they were the springs, lakes, rivers of the world. Tethys was the god-mother of Rhea and raised her during the civil war between the Titans and the Olympians.See, I already knew all that.  Except for the part about her being godmother of Rhea.  I figured the titans were all siblings.  But she raised her during the war between the titans and the gods?  That doesn't really make sense considering Rhea is the mother of the Olympian gods.And 3000 children may -seem- like a lot, but you have to consider they were all the rivers and lakes in the world.  Or rather in the ancient Grecian world, which basically just consisted of Europe and part of the middle east.  Consider how few 3000 is, if their children had been ALL of the rivers and lakes in the ENTIRE world.And it wasn't uncommone for gods and titans to marry their sisters, either.  But I figure that's because there wasn't anyone else.  Especially early on, when there weren't any humans or semi-devine beings or even any gods besides the original six.  And what god is gonna marry a mortal anyway.

Ha ha, I was just thinking about that earlier. Time is relative. At least the way it's measured. I mean, a year here is only a year here...go to some other planet and a year there is totally different. Time exists, but not in hours and minutes the way we measure it. Days here are as long as they are because that's how long it takes for the Earth to rotate 360 degrees. A day on Venus, for example, is over 200 Earth days.... And like Thethys said, time in the depths of space is totally different. There's nothing really to measure it by.When we say 'the solar system formed 4 billion years ago' that's four billion of our years. Sure it's the same amount of time however you measure it, but 'year' 'minute' and 'hour' exist for our convenience.Gwa. Time theories...they make the brain hurt.

My friend is working on making a game, or at least gathering  people to help him.  And he needs someone to create monster designs.  He just said to make them scary and gruesome.  Well, I'm not very good at designing creatures without some sort of guideline, and I don't do gruesome.  Couldn't even if I tried.  Otherwise I'd do it.So I wondered if anyone here would be willing to help out.  I immediately thought of Atolm and Crestoe, but I don't know how busy you guys are.So if anyone at all is interested let me know.

i tryed to do scary and grosesome..but they monster looked more cute and pathidic.I've discoverd from watching Sorcerous Stabber Orphen (in in there is a dragon called "bloody August") that if you want grusome and scary give you monster extra joints. in the case of this monster, her arms at one point gain an extra bone.

You're right! I remember in one Zelda game, The Orcarina of Time I believe, at the very beginning somewhat you have to go in a giant talking tree or something and retireve something from inside from a monster. Then the tree dies afterwards or something like that. Is that the right one? It is a faint memory, cause I only saw it once. But I know that game exists, and I am sure it is related to Zelda.

Well it does look kinda organic, but I hadn't actually thought it was alive.  But, still, even if it's alive, that doesn't qualify it as a character.  Plants are alive, but you wouldn't consider a plant a character.  Even if it played a significant role. Listen up brothers and sisters! Come here my desperate tale, I speak of our friends of nature trapped in the dirt like a jail. Vegetables live in oppression, served on out tables each night, this killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight! Salads are only for murderers! Coalslaw's a facioust rajime! Dont think that thay dont have feelings just cuz a radish cant scream. Ive heard the screams of the vegetables, watching their skins being peeled. Grated and steamed with no mercy, how do YOu think that feels?  Carrot jouice constatutes murder, greenhouses prisons for slaves, its time to stop all this gardening, lets call a spade a spade! How low-ass people, do we dare to stoop, making young brocolies bleed in the soup? Untie our beans, uncage our tomatoes, let potted plants free, dont mash that potato! Spare the spud!

After defeating the boss within him, however, he dies because it was already too late.Funnily enough I was playing that last night, I decided to play out the master's quest on the bonus cd that came with The Wind Waker.

I commented on everyone's pets collectively.Eao's cat looks about the same size as my cats are.  And they're pretty big.  But not as big as my aunt and uncle's cat, which I'm certain must be at least part Maine Coon.I thought a Rex was a cat with curly hair, too.  Yeah, a Cornish Rex has curly hair, like a poodle.  I'm pretty sure.Arkon, I'm glad you renamed him.  And I'm sure he's glad too.  Who wants to go through life with a name like Fluffy.  Not to mention about half the cats on the planet are named Fluffy.Scanning pictures right now.  They're kinda old, but the animals don't look much different now.  Except they're fatter.  Especially the cats.

the only problem with having a cat like this is there eyes get this crap in them alot, anyhow too lazy to clean them today o.ooh yeah and the pains of having a fluffy cat not to mention two of them, how there fur gets all natted up and causes these hard to get out hairballs.

your welcome thats one of my favorite sites.I go ther epretty much when im working on character designs.for example, if arkonviox were to die somehow, he would have to reincarnate, for some reason arkonviox must reincarnate into a god of death, because alot of the gods of death have regeneration abilities.St Gabriel who arkonviox decended from was an arc angel of death, rebirth, and some other junk i cant remember. brb with a link and more info.

GabrielIn Judeo-Christian belief, the archangel of Annunciation, Resurrection, Mercy, Revelation and Death. Also known in Hebrew orthography as Gabri-el. The angel who gave the Annunciation of Christ's birth to the Virgin Mary, and also the angel responsible for blowing the Trump on Judgment Day.In Islamic belief, the angel who dictated the Q'uran to Muhammad, and the angel of Truth.Some theological thought holds that Gabriel is (as much as angels can be) female, the only one among a male or androgynous Host. The name is derived from the Sumerian root GBR, governor. mainly arkons traits are he can regenerate, and he is a see'er when st gabriel was destroyed he was reborn as arkon's there are seven all together.for some reason Arkonviox is the one destined to collect the powers of the others. he is both good and evil, and even as a badguy somehow fate plays under his rules. A simplier way to say it is and i do mean simple, is he doesnt always get punished for being evil. its like fate itself, fate isnt always good or bad, fate can be both and yet fate gets away with it and never gets punished. somehow arkon is linked to fate.

oh yeah and the pains of having a fluffy cat not to mention two of them, how there fur gets all natted up and causes these hard to get out hairballs.Ah yes I know ALL about those.  My cat Lisa gets those all the time.  And she hates it when you try to comb them out.  Usually it takes several attempts, cuz she'll either run away after a while or not let you near her without getting your fingers bit off.

I was gonna say how ironic, but then I remembered that resurrection is different from reincarnation. e.e;;;Anyway, shouldn't this be in a separate topic?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You're right! I remember in one Zelda game, The Orcarina of Time I believe, at the very beginning somewhat you have to go in a giant talking tree or something and retireve something from inside from a monster. Then the tree dies afterwards or something like that. Is that the right one? It is a faint memory, cause I only saw it once. But I know that game exists, and I am sure it is related to Zelda.Okay, well a TALKING tree is different.  Kinda like those tree spirits in Golden Sun.

actualy arkonviox can regenerate too, and no i didnt get that idea from hellsing ive said about a million times arkonviox was immortal. in fact in the battle with ecco vs arkonviox ecco wins by choping off arkonviox'es head. arkonviox isnt the only one who's immortal though the other arkons are too. i probably mentioned that a million times.as for reincarnation they reincarnated from gabriel. usualy when you reincarnate you become someone knew with the traits of your former self but your someone intirly new but with an old soul.arkonviox was recarnated from someone else and can also regenerate since he's immortal.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
if arkonviox is like anyone hes more like cell from dbz which i probably based his regeneration off of, the only way he can be killed is if every part of him was destroyed.
</div>

wow you got alot of cats, i like the dog with snow on his nose ha ha.i might as well show you my other cats.this is nermal she lvies with me too right now http//www.arkonviox.com/arkonviox/8-01-2001/5.jpgoliver (my other cat who doesnt live with me)http//www.arkonviox.com/arkonviox/8-01-2001/7.jpg

As you can see this avatar is of Alucard from Hellsing, of course theres more of a story to it then just that but anyhow just thuoght id say i finaly got to see what this series was all about and have to say it wasn't too bad. my only complaint was this girl in it who Alucard refers to as police girl, she just seems like such a weakling.As for Alucard he seems like an Arkon like guy just more calmer, although I still kinda like castlevanias Alucard better but if Alucard from castlevanaia got into a fight with the alucard from Hellsing i relly couldnt say who would win.Also is it just me or do you just wish that Alucard would just give Integra the bitch slap she deserves.ha ha anyhow i should make a rant of this when i have some free time.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey there! Nice to see someone who has an interest in the games still.Ask any veteran from this community and they'll tell you that Ecco II: The Tides of Time is the best of the series. I was attracted to this site a few years ago by playing Defender of the Future on the Dreamcast, and I've been here ever since.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Welcome Silvatexx to Arkonviox.com. Hope to see you around.

Hello and welcome. Tides of Time was my first Ecco game...until I got a DC and DotF...and then I had to download the other Genisis games as roms because I just HAD to have the whole series.

This was just a light pencil drawing in my sketchbook that I never bothered to finish...well I wanted to do something with it so I scanned it and coloured it on the computer. Sadly I have no tablet so I had to do it all with the mouse...but I'm fairly pleased with the way it turned out. Could of done a bit more shading on the dragon though. And it got a little messed up when I converted it to jpeg, but not too badly.

i love the colors on this, like the sun background and the sea.

Once upon a time in ChinaSome believe around the year, one-double knot-three.Head priest of The White Lotus Clan Pai MeiWas walking down the roadContemplating whatever a man with Pai Mei's infinite power would contemplateWhich is another way of saying, who knows.When, a Shaolin monk appeared on the road traveling in the opposite direction.As the monk and the priest crossed paths...Pai Mei in a practically unfathomable display of generosityGave the monk the slightest of nods.The nod, was not returned.Now was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei ?Or, did he just fail to see the generous social gesture?The motives of the monk, remain unknown.What is known, were the consequences.The next morning Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,And demanded that the temple's head Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck to repay the insult.The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable.So began, the massacre of the Shaolin Temple,And all sixty of the monks inside,At the fists of the White Lotus.And so began, the legend of Pai Mei's Five-Point PalmExploding Heart Technique.I went and seen Kill Bill 2 a few weeks ago and ran into a guy in the movie called Pai Mei turns out he was the same actor playing the same character in another movie i seen a few years back called Fist of the White lotus.Well to make this story wierd and more interesting turns out Pai Mei actualy was a real historical figure who relly did have a five finger technqiue that killed people and relly did take over a temple.Anyhow i just thuoght id post this cause Pai Mei kicks ass.

They all are so adorable, especially the black and white ones.My three cats are all siblings.  There were six in the litter but three were given away.  We kept three, one each for me, my sister, and my brother. Furball (the gray one) is mine.  I'm a really big cat lover.  I love dogs, too, and a lot of other kinds of animals.  But I like cats the most.  I guess maybe it's just cuz I grew up with them.  My mom is a big cat lover too, so I could have gotten it from her, if that sort of thing is hereditary.I want to be a cat in my next life.  Than I could get away with being as lazy as I want, and sleeping all day long.
</div>

<div id='container'>
That's pretty awesome.  Love the way you did the colors.  Especially with the sky.Just so you know, it's technically a wyvern--a dragon with only two legs.

Hey, welcome to the forum! :D  Yeah it's been awhile since we had someone new, at least that actually posted.  Don't worry about missing DotF, as the original two games are definately the best ones.  I never even got very far in DotF myself.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Eh, I found it to be a bit dull actually. It isn't a series that I am too hyped up about.Although the Alucard form SOTN rocks.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i have to agree now that i think about it, i was watching alot of previews for it and it doesn't relly live up the hype. give me Alucard from SOTN anyday i never thuoght id ever like castlevania until i played that game.my only problem with hellsing is i think it just has to many vampire self references. like "mmm what a nice day for blood." then you go to a scene with two teenagers who are vampires making more references saying "ha ha ha its great to be a vampire, lets drink the blood from these weak humans to become stronger." then alucard comes in and says "mwa ha ha your to pethetic to be a vampire now i will shoot you with a gun filled with silver bullets"if alucard from SOTN was there he'd pull out the sword say nothing slcie there asses up, and say something cleaver like "it is done..."i love the art style of this series though and some of the violence....i cant wait till crestoe coems back from vacation then i can get his opinion. weve seen alot of cool stuff together....im kinda glad to hear someone sopinion about the series, i been around too many people who are big fans and i was wondering if i was wierd cause i didnt fully agree.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ive played to death all the ecco games that existed, the only thing your missing from defender of the future is the great graphics, most notably the hanging waters level which is like trellias bay level from ecco 2.but to be honest the best game out of the ecco series was ecco 2: tides of time. thats my all time favorite game.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heh...*high fives with fin*  8) TOT was awsome...actually, strange thing is I only really own that one. I emulated the first quite recently, but Ive owned TOT for a long time. Even if DOTF isnt that good, I still have to get it...Im even searching for emulators O_o Im that desperate XD
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, that's good Mutaclone. I like how the sunset colors go from 'hot' to 'cold' then to black with the moon. The blue dragon is good too.wow its about time eccocode has a real opinion about something, you earned a "cool point" from me for learning the ways of being an individual. you should be proud i hardly give them to anyone. hopefuly one day you'll work your way up to charisma points o.o
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i dont think they have emulators for ps2 and dreamcast that are functional right now. but im sure you can pick up a dreamcast for 20 bucks somewhere and ecco dof for dreamcast for 5. dont tell me thats impossible and im living in a dreamland cause i bet i could find it for that much if i wanted too.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well..yeah, Ive found a dreamcast emulator, but I dont have any ROM to test it out with. And I cant find a DOTF rom ANYWERE X_X;;;

I was watching this "Bermuda Triangle" special on Discovery channel when I saw this.A giant bubble (or possibly a cluster of large bubbles) about half a ship's length can take down the ship in about 10 seconds. Or at full length of a ship could sink it in three seconds. A test with a giant bubble hitting a large Naval Warship right in the middle exploded it in half like a torpedo.Wow, bubbles are evil.

It's a certain type of dragon. Mutaclone has done one before like that, if I can recall that memory correctly. Yes, beautifully done with the coloration blending, even if it is with a mouse. I love your style Mutaclone.

Sometime's it bothers me so much just standing next to them I want to smack thier lights out.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 my only problem with hellsing is i think it just has to many vampire self references. like "mmm what a nice day for blood." then you go to a scene with two teenagers who are vampires making more references saying "ha ha ha its great to be a vampire, lets drink the blood from these weak humans to become stronger." then alucard comes in and says "mwa ha ha your to pethetic to be a vampire now i will shoot you with a gun filled with silver bullets"if alucard from SOTN was there he'd pull out the sword say nothing slcie there asses up, and say something cleaver like "it is done..." My thoughts exactly, I am not really impressed by vulger acts that was done in the series. I mean, it could have been done better and maybe with more taste to it. I just think it was done more to impress people who just like it for the blood and violence.But Yeah, I think if the SOTN Alucard was there, he would not be babbling or anything like that. He will just do his job.Ya know, this makes me wantt to play the game.BTW Eao, I think I can take up on your offer, Mangas are easy for me to get. PM me with what titles you are looking for. =)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i like the vulger acts but without any cool enemies to get you pumped or cool heros to make you cheer its just nonsense killing. i can see that on tv or at http "I can feel your energy begining to swell, thats good now take your anger and feed off of it, use it to unleash your power, before its too late for your friends, just take a look out there no one but vegita and trunks can defend themselves not even your father he too will die." i remember watching that scene and had goose bumps cause that was relly fucked up, then Hercules throws the andriods head, the same andriod at the begining of the series who tried to kill gohan. and the andriod says:"gohan let it go, it is not a sin to fight for the right cause, there are those who words alone cannot reach, cell is such a being, i know how you feel you are gentle, i know cause i too have learned to share these feelings but it is because you cherish life you must protect it."then cell turns and looks and goes "ew" and walks towards him and says "this sentimental downpoor is killing me, its so nice of you to help but i prefer doing things my way."then the andriod continues"gohan drop your restraint protect the life i loved, you have the power my scanners sensed it just....let it go."then cell walks up the the andriod and steps on his head crushing it with blood coming out and chips. then you see his main processor fall and shuts down.then gohan looks and thinks "you cherished life, you did everything you could to protect it but...i let you die, i wont do this i wont watch anymore."then cell turns quickly and looks at him because gohan has become angry and the rage from watching another one die has given him the motivation he needs to whoops cells ass.now if you cant say that was good you never been in a helpless situation. but i have to say cell is my all time favorite enemy.i mean look at that cocky smile, it says i can kick your ass and say something cleaver about it too.

i might go straight for topics i posted, or head to where the interesting people are. like when someone cool posts like me, or like when someone who hasnt been here in a while posts.I love eao but i can confidently say when she posts in a topic thats when you know its gonna die. If its a post by eccocode i know the post will seem like it was posted by Ray Liotta when Hannibal opened his skull up revealing his brain and made him eat pieces from his brain. and when shadowdolphin posts i know im gonna have to replie saying something that makes him cry or getting replies  like "why you being so mean arkon" or the when your relly sad the good ol "=("whenever fishy1 posts it kinda reminds me of looking into a fish bowl, and seeing the litle gold fish who sits withen, you sit ther ehoping something cool will happen, like the little fish kicking some sort of ass but instead you find it sjust sitting there doing what a little fishy does. you know what this forum needs charismatic people like Pai Mei. if Pai Mei posted here he'd own everyone here, he'd say something cocky stroke his beard and leave you in bewilderment. and if you pissed him off he'd jump from his computer breaking through the roof of his house then bust through your roof and kick your ass. because pai mei is damned cool like that.

I started working on information on what Ecco 1 and 2 are about. Problem is im not a very good writer because my grammar is poor.So i just wanted to see if anyone wanted to help me patch this up some.If your gonna patch this up i need you to copy the intire thing and repost it with the changes. I dont want you to make changes and post only the changes i need the whole thing. So if your interested please help me with this.---------------------------------------------------------------About Ecco the DolphinEcco was a young dolphin, with five bright silvery marks on his head, which looked like stars forming constellation delphenuis. His family believed the marks on his head where a sign of his destiny. One day a great storm happened, which swallowed his family in a vortex of wind and water, they vanished into the sky. Ecco set off to find his family, meeting an orca who guided him along his journey to find Big Blue, a blue whale who is very old and very wise.Ecco meets Big Blue, who awaits his death in the cold Arctic sea. Ecco has fought off Arctic spiders to get to this point. Big Blue reveals that the storm, which has taken Ecco's family, is a rare one which occurs once every 500 years. All life vanishes at the eye of the storm, but it is unknown why this happens, but there is one older and wiser then Big Blue, called the Asterite. The Asterite is the oldest creature in the sea, and may have existed since before prehistoric times. Ecco sets off to find the Asterite, who lives within a deep chasm, inside a dark cave. Ecco lays his eyes on a creature of great mystical power and benevolence. It is made up of spheres or globes, each individually colored, moving in rythm with one another. The Asterite recognizes Ecco as if they met before, speaking only through thoughts. Ecco notices the Asterite has an empty spot in its rhythmically moving globes, one missing globe. The Asterite shows Ecco a city called Atlantis, a machine that can go back in time, and a place where the missing globe lies. If Ecco can retrieve this globe the Asterite can grant him incredible power. Ecco finds the gateway to Atlantis where he finds crystals called glyphs, which when sung to, sing a different tune back. He also finds rings, which when swam through, can take you to a place far off. The glyphs tell Ecco of great disaster which caused Atlantis to sink. A beam from space put everything into ruins. Survivors fled into the past using their technology. Ecco finds the time machine, a message reveals to him only recognized ones are allowed to travel in time. Ecco precedes with using the time machine, it recognized him, Ecco opens a doorway into the past.Ecco travels back 65 million years, he finds creatures different from his own era. He jumps into the sky for a breath of air, a Pteranadon grabs him. The Pteranadon drops him in a place where creatures communicate much like dolphins. Ecco sings to them, discovering the songs come from creatures on land. The land creatures must be ancestors to Ecco, to dolphin kind. They hear Ecco's song and plunge into the sea to investigate. Ecco dives, noticing he is near his objective. Deep in a dark cave Ecco finds a completely whole Asterite. Ecco attacks it as it attacks back with bolts of energy, Ecco manages to free a globe which triggers his return home, to the future, to the present.Ecco returns the globe to the Asterite who empowers Ecco. Ecco can heals himself, doesn't need to go to the surface for breaths, is stronger. Can create a pulse of sound that becomes an energy wave, is faster. Ecco is now ready to travel back to the moment of the storm and save his family.Upon returning to Atlantis Ecco finds a library of glyphs he did not notice before. The glyphs tell of a planet called Vortex in the star system Cassandra, located in the head of constellation Pegasus. Vortex is dying and can no longer produce food. Every 500 years when Earth and Vortex have a clear path, the Vortex feed upon the Earth. The Atlanteans inscribed messages into glyphs, created teleport rings to help a Dolphin of the future travel to Vortex. Ecco's destiny has just been revealed to him.Ecco finds the Atlantean time machine, he travels back to the moment of the storm. The storm begins and Ecco is pulled up with his family, into a tube, into a machine. Ecco fights his way through strange Vortex creatures, all the way up to their Queen. Ecco destroys the Queen and saves his family and returns to Earth. As Ecco and his family celebrate, one of his family member asks him "Do you think the Vortex are destroyed?". ---------------------------------------------------------------About the Tides of TimeWhen Ecco traveled to the Vortex world, the Queen realized the Asterite empowered him. As Ecco escaped with his family, the Queen followed him back to Earth. She quickly finds the Asterite and destroys it. Ecco loses his power in response, he is no longer safe as Vortex close in on him.Suddenly a doorway much like the one that allows Ecco to travel in time appears. A very unusual Dolphin appears with very long fins and dorsal. She calls herself Trellia, from a possible future opposite to a dark future created by Vortex. She wants Ecco to travel forward with her, an old friend wishes to speak to him. Ecco touches her, allowing him to follow her.Trellia shows Ecco her world, water tubes which can be swam through, islands which float on air. Ecco finds pockets of air which when exposed to sound can launch him high into the sky. After millions of years great eruptions occurred and the ocean became conscious. It created water tubes connecting all the seas of Earth. Dolphins realized the eruptions created a lot of helium. Much of the rocks of the floating islands can hold helium. The Dolphins learned to carry helium allowing them to float. After ten thousand years they learned to fly.Trellia takes Ecco to the water tubes where he can find his friend. She tells him how a giant Medusa which resembles a jellyfish lurks the tubes. The tubes have currents, have holes, have whirlpools many traits that can be found in the sea. Ecco keeps his focus, knowing one wrong move will cause him to fall thousands of feet to his death. As Ecco became more comfortable with his new environment the Medusa lurked towards him, reaching out with her tentacles to grab whatever she reaches to throw out of her aqua nest. Ecco knew the only way to get passed her was to be quick, because fighting her pose an extreme risk, she can float, Ecco cannot. Ecco discovers metaspheres left by the Asterite to allow Ecco to morph into different life forms. Ecco uses the metaspheres to transform into a bird, then a shark, and a jellyfish, until he reaches his destination. Trellia brought Ecco into the future so the Asterite could speak to him. The Asterite is much evolved now, with silvery globes. The Asterite tells Ecco how the Vortex queen tried to destroy it. Ecco must return to his own time to collect the globes to restore it back to life. The Asterite tells Ecco he is the stone which splits the stream into two, that theres two possible futures for Earth and only he can prevent the dark vortex future. The asterite gives Ecco a metasphere which sends Ecco back to his own time.Ecco returns to the present where he eventually meets Blackfin of the four islands. Blackfin takes Ecco to Tara who knows the way to the sea of darkness where he can find the first pair of the many Asterite globes. It's in the sea of darkness Ecco learns Vortex from the dark future have come and stolen the final pair, but the first pair is under the possession of the Moray deep in the abyss. Deep in the abyss the shelled Moray becomes a keeper. Ecco defeats the Moray gaining the first two of many globes. The first pair tells him to go out and seek more of them. Ecco travels back and forth with the aid of teleport rings collecting the missing globes. Ecco collects them all realizing theres a final pair that cannot be retrieved. The Asterite tells Ecco how the Vortex Queen has gained knowledge of the time machine. Vortex from the dark future used this knowledge to steal the final pair of globes, but the time machine cannot travel into the future, it can only go up the stream of time into the past. Ecco searches for another way to retrieve the final pair, he discovers the Queen has spawned a new race of Vortex that dies when exposed to light. He also notices how the regular Vortexes have changed blue from being on Earth. Then out of the darkness Ecco is grabbed by two strange creatures. They open a doorway in time and take Ecco into the future, the dark future.When Ecco arrives into the dark future his two captors burst into pieces. The sky is a red and orange color, Ecco appears to be in some sort of machine. Strange round squishy creatures called Amoebas start noticing there new visitor. Ecco also realizes this machine he's in can defies gravity. There is not a lot of creatures guarding this machine, but the machine has a lot of traps. Ecco searches for the final two globes. As he searches, he wonders, where are all the Dolphins? Then the answer comes to him, a metal creature awakens. It looks like a metal shark, then a sharp spike emerges from its face.Something begins to emerge from this creature's backside, a rocket ready to propel this creature full speed into Ecco. Ecco realizes this creature is a Dolphin. The creature attacks with its beak and charges into its enemies, sharks charge into their enemies and bite. Dolphins are no longer a living organism but soulless machines. Ecco easily defeats this strange Dolphin and seeks out the globe holder. The globe holder is round and sphere like, inside the globes fight trying to trust their way free. The globe holder is attached to the walls by two gooey arms. Ecco attacks the arms bursting the sphere free. The globes fight inside as Ecco fights the outside, the giant sphere tries to smash Ecco by thrusting itself into the walls. Eventually the sphere breaks and the globes are freed. Ecco swims to the globes as a portal suddenly opens returning the globes and Ecco back to the present.Ecco returns the globes to the Asterite and revitalizes with power and restores Ecco his. The Asterite summons fellow singers to help Ecco defeat the Vortex, and Ecco travels to the Queens new earth hive where the final battle will begin. Ecco travels into the machine and emerges into the Queens chambers. The queen reaches for Ecco with her long tongue but Ecco dodges and rips her tongue off. Ecco attacks the Queen with his newly restored power and after a few hits, the queen starts to dissolve and a small Vortex larvae emerges.Ecco returns home to celebrate then seeks out the Asterite who summons him one last time. The Asterite congratulates Ecco on defeating the Vortex Queen. He tells Ecco how when he sent Ecco into the past originally that caused the stream of time to split into two, that is why he is the stone. To prevent this from happening again Ecco must destroy the Atlantean time machine, peace cannot exist unless Ecco does this last task. Ecco returns to Atlantis, he finds the time machine and strange Vortex larvae swimming amongst it, Ecco decides not to destroy it.When Ecco defeated the vortex queen she made her way to Atlantis as a Vortex larvae. She used the time machine and escaped into the Earth's past. When the Queen arrived into the prehistoric era she encounters creatures she cannot rule, she has no choice but to live within the life cycles of the Earth. Through the eons the Vortex kind integrate with life on Earth.Ecco finds the time machine, instead of destroying it he uses it and disappears into the tides of time.---------------------------------------------------------------

Heh, yeah....UFOs do seem a popular theary about the Bermuda Triangle....and everything else....everyone wants to blame things on aliens.I saw that was on, but I didn't watch it either. Probably for the same reason....Was too busy watching Mythbusters before that, hehheh. Remote control taxis and blowing stuff up....Also they did something about sinking ships and bubbles, and it seemed to prove the same thing, that too many bubbles=sinking ship.

Well because I have a severe abundance of free time, I shall help you out. I RP all the time, my grammer's pretty good....About Ecco the Dolphin Ecco was a young dolphin with five bright silvery marks on his head that looked like stars forming constellation Delphenuis. His family believed the marks on his head were a sign of his destiny. One day a great storm occured, which swallowed his family in a vortex of wind and water; they vanished into the sky. Ecco set off to find his family, meeting an orca who guided him along his journey to find Big Blue, a blue whale who is very old and very wise. Ecco meets Big Blue, who awaits his death in the cold Arctic sea. Ecco has fought off many Arctic spiders and other threats to get to this point. Big Blue reveals that the storm, which has taken Ecco's family, is a rare one which occurs once every 500 years. All life vanishes at the eye of the storm, but it is unknown why this happens He tells Ecco that there is one older and wiser than himself, a being called the Asterite. The Asterite is the oldest creature in the sea, and may have existed since before prehistoric times. Ecco sets off to find the Asterite, who lives within a deep chasm, inside a dark cave. Ecco lays his eyes on a creature of great mystical power and benevolence. It is made up of spheres or globes, each individually colored, moving in rythm with one another. The Asterite recognizes Ecco as if they met before, speaking only through thoughts. Ecco notices the Asterite has an empty spot in its rhythmically moving globes, one missing globe. The Asterite shows Ecco a city called Atlantis, a machine that can go back in time, and a place where the missing globe lies. If Ecco can retrieve this globe the Asterite can grant him incredible power. Ecco finds the gateway to Atlantis where he finds crystals called glyphs. When sung to, glyphs sing a different tune back. He also finds rings, which when swum through, can take you to a place far off. The glyphs tell Ecco of great disaster which caused Atlantis to sink. A beam from space put everything into ruins. Survivors fled into the past using their technology. Ecco finds the time machine, and a message reveals to him only recognized ones are allowed to travel in time. The time machine recognises him, and Ecco opens a doorway into the past.When Ecco travels back 65 million years, he finds creatures different from his own era. As he jumps into the sky for a breath of air, a Pteranadon grabs him. The Pteranadon drops him in a place where creatures communicate much like dolphins. Ecco sings to them, discovering the songs come from creatures on land. The land creatures must be ancestors to Ecco, to dolphin kind. They hear Ecco's song and plunge into the sea to investigate. Ecco dives, noticing he is near his objective. Deep in a dark cave Ecco finds a completely whole Asterite. Ecco attacks it and it attacks back with bolts of energy, butEcco manages to free a globe which triggers his return home to the future, to the present. Ecco returns the globe to the Asterite who then empowers Ecco. Ecco can heal himself, doesn't need to go to the surface for breaths, and is stronger. He can create a pulse of sound that becomes an energy wave, and he is faster. Ecco is now ready to travel back to the moment of the storm and save his family. Upon returning to Atlantis Ecco finds a library of glyphs he did not notice before. The glyphs tell of a planet called Vortex in the star system Cassandra, located in the head of constellation Pegasus. Vortex is dying and can no longer produce food. Every 500 years when Earth and Vortex have a clear path, the Vortex feed upon the Earth. The Atlanteans inscribed messages into glyphs and created teleport rings to help a Dolphin of the future travel to Vortex. Ecco's destiny has just been revealed to him. Ecco finds the Atlantean time machine and he travels back to the moment of the storm. The storm begins and Ecco is pulled up with his family, into a tube, into a machine. Ecco fights his way through strange Vortex creatures, all the way up to their Queen. Ecco destroys the Queen, saves his family, and returns to Earth. As Ecco and his family celebrate, one of his family member asks him "Do you think the Vortex are destroyed?". --------------------------------------------------------------- About the Tides of Time When Ecco traveled to the Vortex world, the Queen realized the Asterite empowered him. As Ecco escaped with his family, the Queen followed him back to Earth. She quickly finds the Asterite and destroys it. Ecco loses his power in response, and he is no longer safe as Vortex close in on him. Suddenly a doorway much like the one that allows Ecco to travel in time appears. A very unusual Dolphin appears with very long fins and dorsal. She calls herself Trellia, from a possible future opposite to a dark future created by Vortex. She wants Ecco to travel forward with her, an old friend wishes to speak to him. Ecco touches her, allowing him to follow her. Trellia shows Ecco her world, water tubes which can be swum through, islands which float on air. Ecco finds pockets of air which when exposed to sound can launch him high into the sky. After millions of years great eruptions occurred and the ocean became conscious. It created water tubes connecting all the seas of Earth. Dolphins realized the eruptions created a lot of helium and much of the rocks of the floating islands can hold helium. The Dolphins learned to carry helium, allowing them to float. After ten thousand years they learned to fly. Trellia takes Ecco to the water tubes where he can find his friend. She tells him how a giant Medusa which resembles a jellyfish lurks the tubes. The tubes have currents, holes, and whirlpools; many traits that can be found in the sea. Ecco keeps his focus, knowing one wrong move will cause him to fall thousands of feet to his death. As Ecco became more comfortable with his new environment the Medusa lurked towards him, reaching out with her tentacles to grab whatever she reaches and throw it out of her aqua nest. Ecco knew the only way to get passed her was to be quick, because fighting her poses an extreme risk--she can float, Ecco cannot. Ecco discovers metaspheres left by the Asterite allow Ecco to morph into different life forms. Ecco uses the metaspheres to transform into a bird, then a shark, and a jellyfish, until he reaches his destination. Trellia brought Ecco into the future so the Asterite could speak to him. The Asterite is much more evolved now, with silvery globes. The Asterite tells Ecco how the Vortex queen tried to destroy it.

Well there ya go, I fixed what seemed to need fixed, changed a few words here and there...hopefully that'll do.

I think that how the sky merges is done quite well. Mouse art is a pain to do and a much need of patience.Anything that bothers me would be the thickness of the tail in certain areas and the wings dont exactly connected to the body, despite two colors being used.But other than that it is a nice job. ^^

Well I like Dragon Ball,  I use to watch it all the time until they decided to move it on cable. Hell I remmeber the Dragon ball when Goku was just a kid.Yes the villians were cool, although sadly I never saw the shows with Cell in it.

Hmmm perhaps a seperate thread or section to show off Avatars? Perhaps even discuss the reasoning behind it or why vetain aspects are as they are. :?  A thought.

Beautifully done Teth, what did you use for it?
</div>
<br />

My personal oppinion is that making an avatar yourself adds a little bit of yourself to it. ^^ You get to make it the way YOU want it to be or represent what you wish to. Keep this one Teth, and if you get tired, make another.

http mainly europe is the only place that has been through as a country what we have. the middle east, well where over there fucknig with them, so they have every reason to hate the US. but brazil who we probably help out alot, and we do, i say the united states needs to pull the plug on countries like these and let them fend for themselves.i dont hate brazil but i mean after reading this article you cant help but think. they talk so much shit in there papers of how the US is an imperialistic threat to the world, they talk the most shit about the united states president, and whenever we put them in the spotlight and say one small thing about there president they get all pissed off and go as far as banning the newes paper the article is in. when im sure we allow all there shit about how the united states is satan go into our country.you'll be surprised how much ive learned about this country, its not a bad place, but there politics seem to just bite there own asses. Back in 1985 they used to be under a military dictatorship. The united states isnt so special i know that, as a country its degrading because of failed leadership, our new elections isnt even bringing anyone good to the office: john kerry. puh john kerry is a pussy, and bush, well i hate him alot and think he's a dumb ass but you cant help but say he has got alot accomplished while in office, i just think its sad we had to loose all our allies with his idiocy of running things. Anyways i thuoght i'd vent that out.

Ecco must return to his own time to collect the globes to restore it back to life. The Asterite says Ecco is the stone which splits the stream into two; there are two possible futures for Earth and only he can prevent the dark vortex future. The Asterite gives Ecco a metasphere which sends him back to his own time.Ecco returns to the present where he eventually meets Blackfin of the four islands. Blackfin takes Ecco to Tara who knows the way to the sea of darkness, where he can find the first pair of the many Asterite globes. It's in the sea of darkness Ecco learns Vortex from the dark future have stolen the Asterite's final pair of globes.The first pair is under the possession of the Moray. Deep in the abyss, the shelled Moray becomes a keeper. Ecco defeats the Moray gaining the first two of many globes. The first pair tells him to go seek more of them.Ecco travels back and forth with the aid of teleport rings collecting the missing globes. As Ecco collects them, he realizes the final pair cannot be retrieved. The Asterite tells Ecco how the Vortex Queen gained knowledge of the time machine. Vortex from the dark future used this knowledge to steal the final pair of globes, but the time machine cannot travel into the future, it can only go up the stream of time into the past. As Ecco searches for another way to retrieve the final pair, he discovers the Queen has spawned a new race of Vortex that dies when exposed to light. He also notices how the regular Vortexes have changed blue from being on Earth. Then out of the darkness Ecco is grabbed by two strange creatures. They open a doorway in time and take Ecco into the future, the dark future.When Ecco arrives into the dark future his two captors burst into pieces. The sky is a red and orange color, Ecco appears to be in some sort of machine. Strange round squishy creatures called Amoebas start noticing there new visitor. Ecco realizes this machine he's in can defy gravity. There is not many creatures guarding this machine, but the machine has lots of traps. Ecco searches for the final two globes. As he searches, he wonders--where are all the Dolphins? Then the answer comes to him when a metal creature awakens. It looks like a metal shark, but then a sharp spike emerges from its face .Something begins to emerge from this creature's backside--a rocket ready to propel this creature full speed into Ecco. Ecco realizes this creature is a Dolphin. The creature attacks with its beak and charges into its enemies, sharks charge into their enemies and bite. Dolphins are no longer living organisms but soulless machines. Ecco easily defeats this strange Dolphin and seeks out the globe holder.The globe holder is round and sphere like; inside the globes fight trying to trust their way free. The globe holder is attached to the walls by two gooey arms. Ecco attacks the arms bursting the sphere free. The globes fight inside as Ecco fights the outside, and the giant sphere tries to smash Ecco by thrusting itself into the walls. Eventually the sphere breaks and the globes are freed. Ecco swims to the globes and a portal suddenly opens returning the globes and Ecco back to the present.Ecco returns the globes to the Asterite, which revitalizes with power and restores Ecco his. The Asterite summons fellow singers to help Ecco defeat the Vortex, and Ecco travels to the Queen's new earth hive where the final battle will begin. Ecco travels into the machine and emerges into the Queens chambers. The Queen reaches for Ecco with her long tongue but Ecco dodges and rips her tongue off. Ecco attacks the Queen with his newly restored power and after a few hits, the Queen starts to dissolve and a small Vortex larvae emerges.Ecco returns home to celebrate, then seeks out the Asterite who summons him one last time. The Asterite congratulates Ecco on defeating the Vortex Queen. He tells Ecco how, when he sent Ecco into the past originally, that caused the stream of time to split into two, that is why he is the stone. To prevent this from happening again Ecco must destroy the Atlantean time machine; peace cannot exist unless Ecco does this last task.Ecco returns to Atlantis. He finds the time machine and strange Vortex larvae swimming amongst it, but Ecco decides not to destroy it.When Ecco defeated the vortex queen she made her way to Atlantis as a Vortex larvae. She used the time machine and escaped into the Earth's past. When the Queen arrived into the prehistoric era she encounters creatures she cannot rule, and she has no choice but to live within the life cycles of the Earth. Through the eons the Vortex kind integrate with life on Earth.Ecco finds the time machine, and instead of destroying it he uses it and disappears into the tides of time.

http NautikaNautika is the Arkon of water, when the 7 incarnations were born she was captured and sent into the far future so her power could never reuinite with the other Arkons. In the future she was injured, injured to a point where her immortality couldnt recover her. It is said she died, until the Lemurians (an advanced culture of the future) descovered her and upgraded her Wings of burden making her the strongest of all the Arkons. Her only weakness is the one thing a creature of water cannot defeat: lightening. Nautika is sent into the past to aid Ecco in preventing the dark future. When Nautika arrives she descovers a traitorous Arkonviox has also joined Ecco. Nautika knows of Arkonviox's dark plans but relizes she must not intervene with the past too much. During her whole quest she tries to put up with Arkonviox's childish behavior, Arkonviox is able to read her thoughts and tries to provoke her into battling with him. She is able to endure Arkonviox long enough and even manages to sacrfice herself to save Ecco and Crestoe from a swarm of Vortex. After her death Arkonviox goes off and kills 5 Arkons on a quest for power. Arkonviox returns to the very place where Nautika sacrificed herself, finding shes still there and has been waiting for him all this time. She tells Arkonviox, just finish me and shut up. They have a final battle and Arkonviox kills her.

Hmmm perhaps a seperate thread or section to show off Avatars? Perhaps even discuss the reasoning behind it or why vetain aspects are as they are. :?  A thought.I was thinking something along the line of that. In fact I shall open a topic just like that!

lol. Anyways... I was just wondering, how did you people come up with your avas/characters?Shadow Dolphin was born from a story. (Hint, hint, fanfare.) He was designed by the Vortex. The Vortex stole a chunk of Ecco's DNA and incubated it. When it was born they tortured it for years. Until it escaped...

I was watching this "Bermuda Triangle" special on Discovery channel when I saw this.A giant bubble (or possibly a cluster of large bubbles) about half a ship's length can take down the ship in about 10 seconds. Or at full length of a ship could sink it in three seconds. A test with a giant bubble hitting a large Naval Warship right in the middle exploded it in half like a torpedo.Wow, bubbles are evil.Dude that's...weird. o.o  How can bubbles do that?  But I suppose it would explain it if that's really true.I didn't even know about the special.  I spend more time on the computer these days than watching TV.  Can't do both at the same time cuz the computer is in a separate room.

Well, according to the special:The bubbles cause the water to be less dense. The middle of the boat sinks in, as the ends if the boat float up from the dense water. Thus, this inbalance rips it in half.Very scary.

Tethys was originally a completely different character altogther.  Many years ago, I made up this species called Sanayas, which look like dolphins but they come in all colors of the rainbow and shine like polished gems.  They lived in like some kind of alternate universe or something.  So when I came to this site and saw everyone had they're own characters, I figured I should make one too.  I remembered the Sanayas, so I made that into my character, except I tweaked the design to make the species a bit more unique.  My character was originally purple and white (more white than she has now and no funky designs or anything), with blue eyes, and looked like a dolphin but with a shorter beak,  long fins that had little round thingies at the ends, and the same funky tail that she retains now. Then I named my character Tethys, which I got from Greek mythology.  I kept trying to come up with different names, but Tethys kept popping into my mind, so I decided that was destined to be her name.Oh, I should make it clear, that the picture I have right now for my avatar is not Tethys, but one of my other characaters.Anyway, later on I decided I wanted something a little different.  So I changed Tethys's design almost completely.  I based her new look off a plesiosaur.  But I made her face more dolphin-like.  And I kept the tail because I really liked it.  Now she has several shades of purple instead of just one, and less white.  Plus the markings.  When I changed Tethys's design, I also changed what she was and her entire story.  She became an Ocean Gaurdian.  And then I created three more, her sister and brothers, one gaurdian for each ocean.  And I never really did develop Tethys or the others very much after that.

A tree IS a plant ya know.Duh. e.eI mean a TALKING plant is different, cuz then it can have a personality and such.  It can be developed as a character, if it has the ability to talk.  But obviously a talking plant is no ordinary plant.  It has some sort of magical property, or else it is some kind of spirit, or an ent (like in LOTR).  Or something along those lines.  So that's different.  The way I see it, in order for something to qualify as a character, it has to be able to interact with other characters, and have the ability to show some growth and development (whether it actually does is another thing, but what counts is it -could- be developed if so chosen).Basically, a character's gotta have some sort of personality.  Otherwise, well there's gotta be some sort of word for it, but I can't think what it is.

Arkon, you have more problems besides grammar.Good thing I decided against being an English teacher.  I think I'd go insane.I was gonna say some things, but I forgot what, and I'm too tired now.Well one thing was the run-on sentances.  There's a ton of them.And I just have to say this: Don't you read much?About Ecco the Dolphin Ecco was a young dolphin with five bright silvery marks on his head.  These marks looked like stars forming constellation Delphinus. His family believed the marks on his head were a sign of his destiny. One day, a great storm swallowed his family in a vortex of wind and water, and they vanished into the sky. Ecco set off to find his family.  On the way, he met an orca who guided him along his journey to find the Big Blue, (I'm pretty sure it was "the" in the game) a blue whale who is very old and very wise. Ecco meets the Big Blue, who awaits his death in the cold arctic sea. Ecco has fought off arctic spiders to get to this point. Big Blue reveals that the storm, which took Ecco's family, is a rare one which occurs once every 500 years. All life vanishes at the eye of the storm, but it is unknown why this happens.  , there is one older and wiser then the Big Blue, called the Asterite. The Asterite is the oldest creature in the sea, and may have existed since before prehistoric times. Ecco sets off to find the Asterite, who lives within a deep chasm. Ecco lays his eyes on a creature of great mystical power and benevolence. It is made up of spheres or globes, each individually colored, moving in rythm with one another. The Asterite recognizes Ecco as if they met before, speaking only through thoughts. Ecco notices the Asterite has an empty spot in its rhythmically moving globes , one missing globe. The Asterite shows Ecco a city called Atlantis, a machine that can go back in time, and a place where the missing globe lies.. If Ecco can retrieve this globe, the Asterite will grant him incredible power. Ecco finds the gateway to Atlantis where he finds crystals called glyphs. When sung to, the glyphs sing a different tune back.  He also finds rings, which when swam through, can take you to a place far off. The glyphs tell Ecco of great disaster which caused Atlantis to sink. A beam from space put everything into ruins. Survivors fled into the past using their technology. Ecco finds the time machine, and a message reveals to him only recognized ones are allowed to travel in time. Ecco, recognized byt the time machine, precedes to use it, opening a doorway into the past. Ecco travels back 65 million years.  He finds creatures different from his own era. When he jumps into the sky for a breath of air, a Pteranadon grabs him. The Pteranadon drops him in a place where creatures communicate much like dolphins. Ecco sings to them, discovering the songs come from creatures on land. The land creatures must be ancestors to Ecco, to dolphin kind. They hear Ecco's song and plunge into the sea to investigate. Ecco dives, noticing he is near his objective. Deep in a dark cave Ecco finds a completely whole Asterite. Ecco attacks it as it attacks back with bolts of energy.  He finally manages to free a globe which triggers his return home--to the future, to the present. Ecco returns the globe to the Asterite who empowers Ecco. Now Ecco can heal himself, doesn't need to go to the surface for breaths, and is stronger.  He can create a pulse of sound that becomes an energy wave, and is faster. Ecco is now ready to travel back to the moment of the storm and save his family. Upon returning to Atlantis Ecco finds a library of glyphs he did not notice before. The glyphs tell of a planet called Vortex in the star system Cassandra, located in the head of the constellation Pegasus. Vortex is dying and can no longer produce food. Every 500 years when Earth and Vortex have a clear path, the Vortex feed upon the Earth. The Atlanteans inscribed messages into glyphs, created teleport rings to help a Dolphin of the future travel to Vortex. Ecco's destiny has just been revealed to him. Ecco finds the Atlantean time machine again and travels back to the moment of the storm. The storm begins and Ecco is pulled up with his family, into a tube leading to a giant machine. Ecco fights his way through strange Vortex creatures, all the way up to their Queen. Ecco destroys the Queen and saves his family and returns to Earth. As Ecco and his family celebrate, one of his family members asks him "Do you think the Vortex are destroyed?". --------------------------------------------------------------- About the Tides of Time When Ecco traveled to the Vortex world, the Queen realized that the Asterite had empowered him. As Ecco escaped with his family, the Queen followed him back to Earth. She quickly finds the Asterite and destroys it. Ecco loses his power in response.  He is no longer safe as Vortex close in on him. Suddenly a doorway much like the one that allows Ecco to travel in time appears. A very unusual dolphin with very long fins and dorsal appears. She calls herself Trellia, from a possible future opposite of a dark future created by the Vortex. She wants Ecco to travel forward with her--an old friend wishes to speak to him. Ecco touches her, allowing him to follow her. Trellia shows Ecco her world.  Water tubes which can be swam through.  Islands float in the air. Ecco finds pockets of air which when exposed to sound can launch him high into the sky.&lt;&lt;(There has GOT to be a better way to write that, if only I could think of one) After millions of years great eruptions occurred and the ocean became conscious. It created water tubes connecting all the seas of Earth. Dolphins realized the eruptions created a lot of helium. Much of the rocks of the floating islands can hold helium. The Dolphins learned to carry helium allowing them to float. After ten thousand years they learned to fly. Trellia takes Ecco to the water tubes where he can find his friend. She tells him how a giant Medusa which resembles a jellyfish lurks in the tubes.(a medusa is a KIND of jellyfish) The tubes have currents, holes, whirlpools, and many other traits that can be found in the sea. Ecco keeps his focus, knowing one wrong move will cause him to fall thousands of feet to his death. As Ecco became more comfortable with his new environment, the Medusa lurked towards him, reaching out with her tentacles to grab whatever she reaches to throw out of her aqua nest. Ecco knew the only way to get passed her was to be quick, because fighting her poses an extreme risk.  She can float, Ecco cannot. Ecco discovers metaspheres left by the Asterite to allow Ecco to morph into different life forms.(I thought the Atlanteans created them...But I could be wrong) Ecco uses the metaspheres to transform into a bird, then a shark, and a jellyfish, until he reaches his destination. Trellia brought Ecco into the future so the Asterite could speak to him. The Asterite is much evolved now, with silvery globes.(they looked gold to me) The Asterite tells Ecco how the Vortex queen tried to destroy it. Ecco must return to his own time to collect the globes to restore it back to life. The Asterite tells Ecco he is the stone which splits the stream (of time) in two, that there are two possible futures for Earth, and only he can prevent the dark Vortex future. The Asterite gives Ecco a metasphere which sends Ecco back to his own time. Ecco returns to the present where he eventually meets Blackfin of the four islands. Blackfin takes Ecco to Tara who knows the way to the sea of darkness where he can find the first pair of the many Asterite globes. It's in the sea of darkness Ecco learns Vortex from the dark future have come and stolen the final pair, but the first pair is under the possession of the Moray deep in the abyss. Deep in the abyss the shelled Moray becomes a keeper. Ecco defeats the Moray, gaining the first two of many globes. The first pair tells him to go out and seek more of them. Ecco travels back and forth with the aid of teleport rings, collecting the missing globes. He collects them all, realizing there is a final pair that cannot be retrieved. The Asterite tells Ecco how the Vortex Queen has gained knowledge of the time machine. Vortex from the dark future used this knowledge to steal the final pair of globes.  But the time machine cannot travel into the future, it can only go up the stream of time into the past. Ecco searches for another way to retrieve the final pair. He discovers the Queen has spawned a new race of Vortex that dies when exposed to light. He also notices how the regular Vortexes have changed to blue from being on Earth. Then out of the darkness, Ecco is grabbed by two strange creatures. They open a doorway in time and take Ecco into the future--the dark future.

Ecco swims to the globes as a portal suddenly opens, returning the globes and Ecco back to the present. Ecco returns the globes to the Asterite and revitalizes with power and restores Ecco his.&lt;&lt;(I think you need to rewrite that sentance because I don't quite understand it) The Asterite summons fellow singers to help Ecco defeat the Vortex, and Ecco travels to the Queen's new Earth hive where the final battle will begin. Ecco travels into the machine and emerges into the Queen's chambers. The Queen reaches for Ecco with her long tongue, but Ecco dodges and rips her tongue off. Ecco attacks the Queen with his newly restored power and, after a few hits, the queen starts to dissolve and a small Vortex larva emerges. (larvae is plural) Ecco returns home to celebrate.  Then he seeks out the Asterite, who summons him one last time. The Asterite congratulates Ecco on defeating the Vortex Queen. He tells Ecco how when he sent Ecco into the past originally, that caused the stream of time to split into two, and that is why he is the stone. To prevent this from happening again, Ecco must destroy the Atlantean time machine.  Peace cannot exist unless Ecco does this last task. Ecco returns to Atlantis, finding the time machine and strange Vortex larvae swimming amongst (around?) it.  Ecco decides not to destroy the time machine.When Ecco defeated the vortex queen she made her way to Atlantis as a Vortex larva. She used the time machine and escaped into the Earth's past. When the Queen arrived into the prehistoric era, she encounters creatures she cannot rule.  So she has no choice but to live within the life cycles of the Earth. Through the eons the Vortex kind integrate with life on Earth. Ecco finds the time machine, instead of destroying it he uses it and disappears into the tides of time.

We had to read other people's work in my Creative Writing class...and there was one story that looked like the person who wrote it had never even looked at a book in his entire life, or had never been made to write anything.

The design is cool, I like the antler-type things on her head, and really like the wings.  Nice story, too.  But no, I don't know where your inspiration came from.  Though I can't say it doesn't sound somewhat familiar.I think I was gonna say something else, but I forgot. o_o;Her name doesn't have "arkon" in it?Yeah i couldnt come up with a good female name that had Ark, Kra, or any of those Arkon like combinations. Mainly for two reasons: one she was based on a real person somewhat, which relly helps when trying to create a good real character. and two shes very different from the other arkons because of how her armor operates and how she uses her power.As for inspiration her name explains it all, just trie to guess think it to yourself and lets not talk about it, you'll touch a soft spot and make me crie and when arkon cries mr pugglesworth gets angry and when mr pugglkesworth gets angry people DIE!anyhow dispite who this character is based on and anything like that she came out an awesome character and im pretty happy with her story, i think alot of people will like her. as for arkonviox im not sure if your suppose to like him or hate him. i think in my story people just feel sorry for him, because hes too much of a jerk to like and has a good heart in him for you not to hate him. hes kinda based on me o.o
</div>

<div id='container'>
the thing is i never relly looked at exactly how people wrote stuff. i know what im doing wrong and when i write it it coems out all wrong, run on setences, or just to many comma's and 'and's' or the sentence just begins all wrong with something like 'But' or 'Ecco' or well you get the point.

Arkonviox.....i'll explain that story in a few days.Mr Prawn *points at discoulored cell avatar* Theres a history behind that. In the blundercaves episode i used to do Mr. Prawn was the arch villian. In the older days the blundercaves was forum based, it was me basicaly picking people form the forum and making fun of them. Mr. Prawn was basicaly my evil hacking alter ego. i used to be apart of an ecco website called the undercaves and we used to joke about what if someone hacked it. So we came up with Mr. PrawnI remember the lines from that blundercaves sketch. "I am Mr. Prawn, I am the perfect hacker, i go from website to website taking them over for spot, but unlike most hackers i dont hack into websites i simply take them over."well, seems i ended up becoming like this alter ego. I took over the undercaves, without hacking, and like mr prawn it was a dark time, and a hostile evil takeover that created other sites like cavernsofhope. i had a war with cavernsofhope where i attacked theremessage board, i got banned 20 times each time id come back withen 3 minutes under someone elses name, most of there members accounts i had access to because in those days i knew everyones passwords from my site, from looking at the member profiles (cant do that now) anyhow from that war silverfin psysonic and i became good friends. then i got access to a message board of someone who was attacking caverns ofhope. I learned there password and gained access to ther epersonal forum, from ther epersonal forum i was able to hack many of there other members personal forums. i destroyed 6 forums and turned the forum i was after into "the mr prawn forum". i also hacked a site that once existed called legend of zelda.com well i didnt hack it, but i flooded there forum through a flaw and caused the whole server to shut down, in responce i made them link to my website. anyways theres more then that, its not something to be proud of but lets just say when you fuck me over i never forget and im very powerful as an ememy but luckly no one here has to worry about that, i do like everyone here, there are some people who occasionaly annoy me but they cant do alot to piss me off. but lets say its because of that temper i dont have a girlfriend (id rather not hurt anyone, i have alot of guil from the past i have to live with.)

To be honest, this was the Arkon I was most intrested in seeing, becuase she was the water elemental. The first thing i was the suit thing on her back and she looks sortta like a machine to me with all the divices on her fins and back. Her tail also looks machine like.
</div>

don't forget I designed her Chara..orginaly suppose to be called "moon tail.its a tuna and dolphin tailed cetaten.wow...*squees* you are so nice Arkon....*sniffles* i'm loved.maybe I'm like the grim reaper of forums....guess i shuld make an avatar based on that.

heh...a drunk leader hates the U.S huh? and he's not runing his country well.I'd say this problems are all his own, maybe, but if you can't run it right and it faulters then why blame it on somone else? more so when you don't accept had outs "oh we're poor I blame you...don't give me money i hate you...."maybe they'd like it more if we lied and said "Brazil is a sweltering land of riches and a strong leaded leader"insted of telling it as it is.

names are either Noriko or Nikitta.diddo on the machernery.......the wings do look mechnical.i just don't quite understand the antlers for many reasons1) she s a girl, most deer thinkgys, only the boys have them2) she's water elemental so I don't see where the antlers fit, if she were a "wood' type I could see, wood-trees-leaves-bark-forest deer.I always pictured her has a long necked animal...like the day when you had the Earth clan give ideas for the two She-arkons.

Eao was created after I finished the TOT (in 199?).......she was orginaly a fan caracter, eccos decendent that was a normal dolphin with a big white star on her head.Her purpose was to rescue ecco (hence "my ecco 3") by rescuing him...because hes cool and she liked listning to the tales about her ancestor (who knows 4th generation down)but x-ammount of years ago I changed eao and hope to write about her, in her own story without any Ecco refferance...save for "my time machine" which is constructed from the many sunken citys of the world.theres said to be on in a deep lake in South America, Atlantis, One by India thats supposivly 9,000 years old.each part has somthing to do (i hope) with where it was found, it looks like a flower when completed.eao has a boss named "Lady leviathan" she became employed by a sick idea of karma, Eao is the anti dolphin...sence they are said to be nice, friendly animals...shes selfish and egotistical, to make up for "the sin of greed" (levithaen is said to be the demon of greed) but her task in the end is somthing unexpected.LL gives eao the power to morph, only because she needs it to do her bidding.eao must eat things to be able to morph.eao is near impossible to draw, because i was an ass and decided to color her a certain way.

Interesting most of the images that come up when searching for Fargal are broken links.Fargal Sharkey is the name of a band, or something, apparantly.  But I can't say I've ever heard of that before.And that makes me wonder, I know you said Fargal was the name of a character you made once, but where did you get the name from originally?http//images.google.com/images?q=tbnwww.arkonviox.com/albums/album03/tethys.jpghttp5pyBygSLoyQJ In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 5 already displayed.If you like, you can repeat the search with the omitted results included.And doing that got me some more sonar maps, an old avatar of Crestoe's, and an avatar of...ah...I think it might have been Phosis but I can't really remember.  I would have expected more, since it was showing stuff from the gallery.And a LOT of stuff searching for Tethys.Results 1 - 20 of about 3,280 for Tethys

Hmm, I remember when you were trying to figure out a name for this character.  At least I think it was this one.  I see the resemblance now.  Funny thing is, my first thought was it sounded kinda like me in some ways. o.o;But enough about that.Female caribou have antlers.  But I think there are some other types, too. And I don't see it as a big deal.  And I didn't know if they are in fact truly meant to be antlers.

Despite what they tell you in some English classes, especially earlier ones, there's nothing wrong with starting a sentance with "and" or "but" as long as you don't do it too often.  Plenty of professional writers do that, and I've even been told by college professors that it's okay.There are other things like that that teachers tell you not to do, that are actually okay to do so long as you don't do it too much.  Basically the "rules" for writing that you're taught in school are more like suggestions or guidelines.  Well, not all of them, but there are several.

its just a rule that the arkons have horns, theres only one exception to this rule but im not ready to unviel that arkon yet since there isnt much of a story to him. tethys: heh i can kinda see where you got that idea, i kinda changed things in a way about Nautika compared to the person shes based on, some of it come from a true story, but the thing about Nautika is shes a likable character, because Arkonviox isnt relly suppose to be that likable nor are you suppose to hate him, and what Nautika does for the others with sacrificing herself you start to like her more, but even then there will be things you dont like about her, for example shes got a certain fakeness to her, and a vunerability even thuogh shes the strongest of all the arkons, not just that but she could defeat arkonviox if she wanted too, but thats not what she wants to do, she is more focused on getting accepted, its arkon who exploits her insecurity and see's she relly wants to get accepted and breaks her down for it. ever knew someone who acted fake to make friends? what arkons doing is trying to make her be real, but at the same time he hasnt realized he's whipping a dead horse, plus i wanted to give people a reason to hate him and give him a reason to feel more guilt towards the end of the game. remember arkonviox wears the wings of burden, his purpose, his life, how atlantis was destroyed and how he didnt defeand it, how he allowed the thirians to die, those are alot of burdens that pile up on him in the end of the game, and it makes you relly think, and even feel sorry for this character but you also relize arkon deserves to die. as for nautika its her purpose in life to be destroyed, only one arkon is to remain in the end, there purpose in life is to kill each other, if one refuses to live by that purpose then there purpose is to die.

Hehheh.....I haven't taken any writing classes, mostly because they don't offer them to anyone at my school except seniors.....but I write like I talk, mostly.

i did a little bit of work on the story.About Ecco the DolphinEcco was a young dolphin with five bright silvery marks on his head that looked like stars forming constellation Delphenuis. His family believed the marks on his head were a sign of his destiny. One day a great storm occured, which swallowed his family in a vortex of wind and water; they vanished into the sky. Ecco set off to find his family, meeting an orca who guided him along his journey to find the Big Blue, a blue whale who is very old and very wise.Ecco meets the Big Blue, who awaits his death in the cold Arctic sea. Ecco has fought off many Arctic spiders and other threats to get to this point. Big Blue reveals that the storm, which has taken Ecco's family, is a rare one which occurs once every 500 years. All life vanishes at the eye of the storm, but it is unknown why this happens He tells Ecco that there is one older and wiser than himself, called the Asterite. The Asterite is the oldest creature in the sea, and may have existed since before prehistoric times.Ecco sets off to find the Asterite, who lives within a deep chasm, inside a dark cave. He lays his eyes on a creature of great mystical power and benevolence. It is made up of spheres or globes, each individually colored, moving in a harmony with one another. The Asterite recognizes him as if they met before, speaking only through thoughts. Ecco notices the Asterite has a missing globe. The Asterite showed Ecco an ancient city called Atlantis. It tells him of a time machine built by the Atlanteans, and instructs him to use this machine to go back in time and retreive the missing globe. If he can retrieve the globe, the Asterite can grant him incredible power.Ecco finds the gateway to Atlantis where he finds crystals called glyphs. When sung to, glyphs react in many different ways; they could echo messages back, release air for a dolphin to breathe, or open pathways. He also finds rings, which when swum through, can teleport a dolphin great distances. Ecco sings to the glyphs which echo back a message of a great disaster which caused Atlantis to sink. A beam from space put everything into ruins. Survivors fled into the past using their technology. Ecco sings to a glyph near the time machine. It responds: 'only recognized ones are allowed to travel in time'. Ecco reconized by the time machine, precedes to use it, opening a doorway into the past.When Ecco travels back 65 million years, he finds creatures different from his own era. As he jumps into the sky for a breath of air, a Pteranadon grabs him. The Pteranadon drops him in a place where creatures communicate much like dolphins. Ecco sings to them, discovering the songs come from creatures on land. The land creatures must be ancestors to Ecco, to dolphin kind. They hear Ecco's song and plunge into the sea to investigate. Ecco dives, noticing he is near his objective. Deep in a dark cave Ecco finds a completely whole Asterite. Ecco attacks it and it attacks back with bolts of energy, but Ecco manages to free a globe which triggers his return home to the future --to the present.Ecco returns the globe to the Asterite who in responce empowers him with great power. Now Ecco can heal himself, doesn't need to surface for breaths, and is stronger. He can create a pulse of sound that becomes an energy wave, he is faster. Ecco is now ready to travel back to the moment of the storm and save his family.Upon returning to Atlantis Ecco finds a library of glyphs he did not notice before. The glyphs tell of a planet called Vortex in the star system Cassandra, located in the head of constellation Pegasus. Vortex is dying and can no longer produce food. Every 500 years when Earth and Vortex have a clear path, the Vortex feed upon the Earth. The Atlanteans inscribed messages into glyphs and created teleport rings to help a Dolphin of the future travel to Vortex. Ecco's destiny has just been revealed to him.Ecco finds the Atlantean time machine and travels back to the moment of the storm. The storm begins and Ecco is pulled up with his family, into a tube, into a machine. Ecco fights his way through strange Vortex creatures, all the way up to their Queen. Ecco destroys the Queen, saves his family, and returns to Earth. As Ecco and his family celebrate, one of his family member asks him "Do you think the Vortex are destroyed?".---------------------------------------------------------------About the Tides of TimeWhen Ecco traveled to the Vortex world, the Queen realized the Asterite empowered him. As Ecco escaped with his family, the Queen followed him back to Earth. She quickly finds the Asterite and destroys it. Ecco loses his power in response, he is no longer safe as Vortex close in on him.Suddenly a doorway much like the one that allows Ecco to travel in time appears. A very unusual Dolphin appears with very long fins and dorsal. She calls herself Trellia, from a possible future opposite to a dark future created by Vortex. She wants Ecco to travel forward with her --an old friend wishes to speak to him. Ecco touches her, allowing him to follow her.Trellia shows Ecco her world. Water tubes which connect islands that float in the clouds. Ecco descovers air pockets in the sky that are sesitive to sound.When exposed to sound, the pockets can launch him, with bursts of wind, high into the sky. After millions of years great eruptions occurred, the ocean became conscious. It created water tubes connecting all the seas of Earth. Dolphins realized the eruptions created a lot of helium and much of the rocks of the floating islands can hold helium. The Dolphins learned to carry helium, allowing them to float. After ten thousand years they learned to fly.Trellia takes Ecco to the water tubes where he can find his friend. She tells him how a giant Medusa which guards the tubes. The tubes have currents, holes, and whirlpools; many traits that can be found in the sea. Ecco keeps his focus, knowing one wrong move will cause him to fall thousands of feet to his death. As Ecco became more comfortable with his new environment the Medusa lurked towards him, reaching out with her tentacles to grab whatever she reaches and throw it out of her aqua nest. Ecco knew the only way to get passed her was to be quick, because fighting her poses an extreme risk--she can float, Ecco cannot.Ecco discovers metaspheres, left by the Asterite, which allow him to morph into different life forms. He uses the metaspheres to transform into a bird, a shark, a jellyfish, and even a school of fish. He relizes Trellia brought him into the future to speak with the Asterite. The Asterite is much more evolved, with metallic-like globes. It tells Ecco how the Vortex Queen tried to destroy it. How Ecco must return to his own time to collect the globes to restore it back to life. It tells Ecco, he is the stone which splits the stream of time into two; there are two possible futures for Earth and only he can prevent the dark vortex future. The Asterite gives Ecco a metasphere which sends him back to his own time.Ecco returns to the present where he eventually meets Blackfin of the four islands. Blackfin takes Ecco to Tara who knows the way to the sea of darkness, where he can find the first pair of the many Asterite globes. It's in the sea of darkness Ecco learns Vortex from the dark future have stolen the Asterite's final pair of globes.The first pair is deep in the abyss, where the shelled Moray becomes its keeper. Ecco defeats the Moray gaining the first pair of many globes. The first pair tells him to go out and seek more globes.Ecco travels back and forth with the aid of teleport rings collecting the missing globes. As Ecco collects them, he realizes the final pair cannot be retrieved. The Asterite tells Ecco how the Vortex Queen gained knowledge of the time machine. Vortex from the dark future used this knowledge to steal the final pair of globes. But the time machine cannot travel into the future, it can only go up the stream of time into the past. As Ecco searches for another way to retrieve the final pair, he discovers the Queen has spawned a new race of Vortex that dies when exposed to light. He also notices how the regular Vortexes have changed blue from being on Earth. Then out of the darkness Ecco is grabbed by two strange creatures. They open a doorway in time and take Ecco into the future --the dark future.When Ecco arrives into the dark future his two captors burst into pieces. The sky is a red and orange color, Ecco appears to be in some sort of machine. Strange round squishy creatures called Amoebas start noticing their new visitor. Ecco realizes this machine he's in can defy gravity. There is not many creatures guarding this machine, but the machine has lots of traps. Ecco searches for the final two globes. As he searches, he wonders--where are all the Dolphins? Then the answer comes to him. A metal creature awakens resembling a shark. A sharp spike emerges from its face. Something else emerges from it's backside--a rocket ready to propel this creature full speed towards Ecco. This creature must be a dolphin; it charges using it's beak to pierce it's enemy. Sharks charge into their enemies and bite. Dolphins in this world are no longer living organisms but soulless machines. Ecco easily defeats this strange dolphin and seeks out the globe holder.The globe holder is round and sphere-like. Inside the globes fight, trying to trust their way free. The globe holder is attached to the walls by two gooey arms. Ecco attacks the arms bursting the sphere free. The globes fight inside as Ecco fights the outside, and the giant sphere tries to smash Ecco by thrusting itself into the walls. Eventually the sphere breaks and the globes are freed. Ecco swims to the globes and a portal suddenly opens returning the globes and Ecco back to the present.The globes are returned to the Asterite, who in responce grants Ecco the power needed to defeat the Vortex. It summons fellow singers to help Ecco with the many vortex drones. Ecco travels to the Queen's new Earth hive where the final battle will begin. He travels through the machine and arrives in the Queens chambers. The Queen reaches for Ecco with her long tongue but Ecco dodges and rips it off. He attacks the Queen with his newly restored power and after a few hits, the Queen starts to dissolve and a small Vortex larva emerges.Ecco returns home to celebrate. Then he seeks out the Asterite who summons him one last time. The Asterite congratulates him on defeating the Vortex Queen. He tells him how, when he sent Ecco into the past originally, that caused the stream of time to split into two, that is why he is the stone. To prevent this from happening again Ecco must destroy the Atlantean time machine; peace cannot exist unless Ecco does this last task.Ecco returns to Atlantis, finding the time machine and strange Vortex larvae swimming around it, but Ecco decides not to the time machine.When Ecco defeated the vortex queen she made her way to Atlantis as a Vortex larvae. She used the time machine and escaped into the Earth's past. When the Queen arrived into the prehistoric era she encounters creatures she cannot rule, and she has no choice but to live within the life cycles of the Earth. Through the eons the Vortex kind integrate with life on Earth.Ecco finds the time machine, and instead of destroying it he uses it and disappears into the tides of time.

I'm writing this in my story about my game, since my game isnt relly linear i have it split up into different parts explaining different characters and the events they bring forth.About the Stone in Time  The Tides of Time, The VoidThe Tides of Time is basicaly a purgatory, where alternate realities continue to exist even if they are no longer apart of the main time line. The dark vortex future was sent here since it is no longer apart of the main timeline. In Ecco the Dolphin time exists in two manners, you cant change your past but you can change your future. Even though Ecco can travel into the past whatever he does to alter it has already happened in his present, anything he does to destroy it is impossible since existing in the past, his fate has been determined. The future on the otherhand cannot be controled by fate, it has not been written. Ecco causes time to split into two streams because of his journeys into the past. Now that the dark future has been prevented, it continues to exist but outside the main timeline. It has to exist cause Ecco traveled there, which means somehow it exists parrallel, but even as it exists in parrallel it remains to be a dead future. The reason why it was sent is the same reason a body might reject a virus. In Ecco's case he had to go on his own free will otherwise time would continue to suffer.this is my explaination of why Ecco vanishes into the tides of time. I can't think of a better way so i thuoght id share it and see if anyone thinks they can break my point with a better point.anyways have fun n.n

So without further adu here it is with almost everything i could think of explained.-------------------------------------------------About the Stone in Time500 years after the disapperence of Ecco the Dolphin, a forgotten threat reveals itself again, it's the Vortex. Ecco defeated their Queen, destroyed an intire hive of on Earth, but failed to defeat the hive on there home planet. It is belvied without a Queen the hive dies, although most of the Vortex have died others have keapt alive searching for a new hive. The mindless drones fall in disarray, but a very old, powerful, bull drone brought order to chaos, which has come by the name, The Vortex King. It is unknown the full intention of the Vortex King, where it came from, how it assumed control. What is known is they want to keep the pathway between Earth and Vortex open, with a new machine that connects Earth and Vortex called Why Ecco vanishes into the Tide of TimeEcco is able to stop the Vortex future from existing by defeating the Vortex Queen, her hive and restoring the Asterite. These are all key elements that lead up to the reason why the Vortex Future came into being in the first place. But Ecco relizes it's not over yet, that his existence is the reason time split to begin with, that without him, the Vortex Queen would of never came to Earth in the first place. He relizes if he destroys the time machine it would cause more damage to time then fix. If the time machine's destroyed the Vortex from the dark future would never be able to steal the final globes, and Ecco's journey into the future to retreive them would never have happened, it was too much of a risk to take. It also seemed time itself was calling for Ecco, like the future he removed from the time axis, for time to continue Ecco also had to vanish at his own free will. He uses the time machine, completing the final task, and time is allowed to flow smoothly once again.About the Stone in Time The Seven Dark WhalesThe Seven Dark Whales are a clan of Orcas who came into existence when the stream of time split into two. Their purpose is to prevent the natural future from happening. In the far end of the Dark Future a revolution will occur, an Orca will stand up to the Vortex threat using a special Atlantean armor that has been keapt away by an extinct Dolphin race called the Thirians. In the Dark Future, Dolphins decide not to revolt, hoping to find a better way to stop the Vortex without sacrificing more lives. Orcas on the other hand want no part of the Dolphin's weakness and steal the holy Atlantean Dolphin armor causing a revolution. The one to wear this Armor is an Orca named Clondike, who will rise up and become known as Apacalypes. When the revolution ends the world will be ruled by Orca kind and Apacalypes reign will last for an eternity. The Armor which Apacalype wears is called the Wings of Burden, which once belonged to a Dolphin Atlantean named Arkonviox. About the Stone in Time  MonArkWhen the 7 incarnations of Gabriel awoken they were sent into different parts of time by the Atlanteans so there power could never reunite. MonArk the Arkon of fire, was taken into the far past by Apollo. MonArk is belived by Dolphin legend to be the Dolphin God of war. About the Stone in Time  NautikaNautika is the Arkon of water, when the 7 incarnations were born she was captured and sent into the far future so her power could never reuinite with the other Arkons. In the future she was injured, injured to a point where her immortality couldnt recover her. It is said she died, until the Lemurians (an advanced culture of the future) descovered her and upgraded her Wings of burden making her the strongest of all the Arkons. Using her water elemental ability she can morph into anything she so desires. Her only weakness is the one thing a creature of water cannot defeat The ThiriansThe Thirians are actualy decendants of old world atlantean dolphins. They are also known by the name new world atlantean dolphins. They live in the city of Thira, a city that once was apart of Poseid, home of Atlantis. Thira now lies in ruins deep under the ocean. Thirians are different from normal dolphins, they resemble eels, have gills but can also breathe air. The city of Thira is ruled by Trident, they also have an army of warriors lead by Crestoe. The Thirians have been at war with the 7 Dark Whale Clan ever since Ecco brought the Vortex Queen to Earth. The 7 Dark whales want to kill off the Thirians and recover an ancient dolphin armor of immense power. The Thirians have tales about an ancient armor that was created in Atlantis and worn by Arkonviox. They worship Arkonviox like a god and belive in the far future Arkonviox will rise up and become the savior of Dolphin kind. The Thirians know Arkonviox lives in the city of Tantalus, a holy city that no being has ever returned back from.About the Stone in Time  VernineusVernineus manefested itself from Ecco's worse fears and is in a way his opposite. Vernineus is a creature of pure energy, probably another creature who was trapped in time for the same reasons Ecco was. When the time portal opened allowing Ecco to return Vernineus followed him out. It sought great power so it could exist in this world and eventualy become a physical being. Only one power was great enough for it to feed upon, the Asterite. It finds the Asterite and hides the globes in a place far off and unknown, perhalps even out of time itself. Vernineus eventualy creates a physical form for itself resembling somewhat of a Vortex but very different, drawing energy from a globe it keeps in its chest. When the globe is drained of all its power it turns into stone becoming innert. As Vernineus draws energy from a globe he slowly starts developing flesh and bone over his energy projected body structure. Vernineus wants to kill Ecco, as well as work on another agenda which remains unknown.About the Stone in Time  The Tower of MU and the Time MachinesThe Seven Dark Whales are the first to relize Atlantis had many time machines which once belonged to MU, as well as an Atlantean built time machine. There are five time machines altogether, two which can travel into the past, two which can travel to the future, and one which can open black portals. The time machines were once all keapt in the tower of MU where they were connected. In order for the time machine that opens black portals to work the other time machines power had to be unlocked. Unlocking them were the only way to make the black portal time machine work. When Ecco returns, this somehow triggers the black portal time machine to awaken. Its this same black portal that caused MU to vanish along with all its people.About the Stone in Time St. Gabriel and the MaskWhen Atlantis was devided by the Gods, St. Gabriel became Posiedens messanger. Gabriel was corrupt as he learned he could change his messages to things for his own desires. When Posieden learned of Gabriels treachory he turned Gabriel into a dolphin as punishment. Gabriel ashamed of his new form started wearing a mask with a human face to cover his shame. Gabriel eventualy wanted revenge against the gods and sought to destroy Atlantis. It was during this time the Atlanteans were ready to break from God rule which Gabriel got in the way. The Atlanteans eventualy kill Gabriel, wher ehis immortality cant bring him back to life. But Gabriels burden of hate and sadness lived on to eventualy become reborn as seven Arkons.About the Stone in Time  AtlaAtla was one of the Levians who helped found Atlantis, he was also the creator of the Mu time machines. The Levians ruled Atlantis until the people sought to over thow there godlike rulers, Atla joined this revolt and became an Atlantean hero as well as the guru of sciences and technology. When Princess Cassandra predicted the destruction of Atlantis, Atla propose they create tools for him so he could travel to Vortex and defeat this menace. The tools would have to be usable by a dolphin, for Atla was a dolphin, the time machine would have to be set so it could reconize him. Atla promised sometime in the future he would find these tools and use them to avenge Atlantis. But Atla had to leave, in a far off future Sitna will awaken and seek to kill him. Atla wanted to keep his promise to Cassandra but at the same time Atla also wanted to gather knowlege and hide in a place where sitna could never find him. Atla decided to split himself into two, one part would be sent into the future, the other would be sent protected by an Arkon into the far far past. The plan was set, Atla could now avenge Atlantis and destroy Sitna.About the Stone in Time : The Marks upon his HeadA baby dolphin appeared out of nowhere, this dolphin had five bright silvery marks upon his head. This baby was eventualy adaopted by a pod of dolphins who found him abandoned. He grew up to be Ecco the Dolphin, one day a violent storm occured which swallowed his family and he descovered it was created by an alien race called the Vortex. Ecco avenged his family and saved them by defeating the Vortex. Time split into two because of Ecco's use of the Atlantean time machine, and eventualy Ecco found he had to vanish in time in order to save it. But certain events would occur for time to split again and Ecco was set free, he went off to defeat the Vortex once again to stop a dark future from being reborn. When his quest was over a clan of dark whales sought to re-awaken the dead dark future by summoning Apacalypes from it. Ecco had no knowlege of this, as he traveled into the past to save the Asterite and destroy Vernineus. So it was up to Arkonviox to destroy Apacalypes for him in a future that was destroyed and about to wreak vengence amoungst the intire cosmos. As both Arkonviox and Ecco returned to the present they came back to a world in ruines ruled by the Earth Clan, and led by a powerful magian dolphin named Sitna. Sitna's presence awakens Apollo the dolphin god and MonArk the dolphin god of war. Apollo has waited since the begining of time to face Sitna, but Apollo relizes only Atla can defeat him. When Ecco appears the marks on his head become evident, Apollo was looking for a dolphin with marks upon his head that represent Apollos rise from the sea. There was a meaning after all, the marks represent Apollo, if Apollo merged with Ecco they would become Atla once again. So Ecco's destiny was revealed.-------------------------------------------------

didnt you bring eccocode to this site? i cant remember.and eccocode: why? If Moonfin brought Eccocode to this site, I think ill just have to go over there and smack her. oh,  and thats beautiful tethys, love the colors. how long did it take you?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Here's the end to it (I was busy!).Anyways, the magnetic field is said to create storms easily. Large ones that could take down planes. Another thing is that it is said that when the "bubbles" (if made of hydrogen or something like that) reach the surface, the energy released is so fast, that it catches on fire. (Meaning, fireballs shooting up from the water!!!)Not sure if any of it is true, such as that no one has been there and come back to tell about it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*bland* Hi!lol. Anyways, good to see life returning to this place.Random!A great place of death, may be revived if flesh returns to it.

<br />
<div id='container'>
D: looks like some1 on drugs gaping.I always use -_- a lot.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The title is incorrect, Arkonviox.com is now #6!!!Also, I don't know why, but even with people here, Arkonviox.com moved down to #10, bottom of the first page. And that's BAD.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
the thing is i never relly looked at exactly how people wrote stuff. i know what im doing wrong and when i write it it coems out all wrong, run on setences, or just to many comma's and 'and's' or the sentence just begins all wrong with something like 'But' or 'Ecco' or well you get the point.U don't need to write good, that what forums r 4! lol.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
If I could make sense of that, it would be cool.Definately interesting, but confusing.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Very long story=Cool story.That's all I can say.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
This is probably the longest topic here, besides "Welcome!".Teth)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, that's what I've heard.  But it sounded like you were saying that the bubbles caused it.  Guess I misunderstood.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't know who you are. x_o;  But, hi.  N' stuff.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I don't remember now. ._.A couple weeks I think.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You are crazy, Arkon, and that's why we love you.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually I think Arkonviox sounds like the bad guy that you can't help but like even though he's evil and does bad things.  Especially if you're a villain fan.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Teth: lol, growth! Plants GROW too, just not that way. Don't be a moron. e.eOh....wait.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
U don't need to write good, that what forums r 4! lol.Speak for yourself.  God, I can't stand it when people type like that.And you DO need to write WELL (not "good") when it's something where writing well counts.  I mean no one cares in a forum or chatroom.  But there are things where it does matter.I'll come back to this later to read the updated versian.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hiya, so you're from the Undercaves....I used to go there, at least in the chat.....my name familiar? lol
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's definately better now, just a few little mistakes that you should be able to find if you read it over again.  Like I think you missed a couple of capitals and a period at one point.  Nothing big.It's just about right for a summary I think.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
How do they make those ratings anyway? How do they figure out which ones should be near the top?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'm not exactly sure how it explains why exactly Ecco went into the tides of time.  Hmm...I thought I had it, but I wouldn't be able to put it into words. So I'm not sure...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wait a second....How come Ecco just appeared out of nowhere?  Why couldn't he just be born like normal, but born with the markings?  In any case, a long read, but very interesting.  It looks as if some stuff from different mythologies is mixed in there. But I can also tell you got ideas from that one site.BTW, it's spelled Poseidon.Unless you spelled it different on purpose...Anyway, sounds great.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
actualy ecco is relly atla, you see atla actualy split himself into two forms in order to complete two goals, remember he promised cassandra he'd avenge atlantis, but at the same time he needed to gather knowlege and skill to defeat sitna. so he split into two forms, one of the two traveled into the far past, while the other traveled to the future. Ecco is one half of atla sent the the future to stop the vortex. when atla splits one half on him is relly old (apollo) the other one is relly young and in fact an infant (ecco) ecco sppears and a family adopt him apollo vanishes into the past awaiting the day sitna awakens, the stars on ecco's head represent apollo's awakening his rise from the sea into the heavens. apollo will rise when sitna awakens, and ecco and apollo must merge to become Atla once again, and it will be at this point Atla will be ready to face sitna. Remember the atlanteans had it planned all along for ecco to defeat the vortex, they planned for a dolphin to do it, but why? well in my story its because the atlantean who planned it (atla) was also the dolphin who would defeat the vortex (ecco). atla is actualy a dolphin, so thats why the glyphs and time machine and everything reconized ecco, cause ecco is actualy atla.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Attually, noone brought me to this site. When i went to gamefaqs.com and when i desited to make my Ecco the Dolphin: DotF walkthrough, BMtaylor told me about Caverns of Hope and i joined that site. Then when i looked at Arkon's site, i though it was cool and i joined.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yup! One of the few survivors from the Undercaves. Good to see you again Fargal. Nice avatar too.Ah, Dreadlord! Nice to see new old faces. :DAgain, ho.

I'd just like to pop in and say I might not be as prevelent around her due to a um..."short of forced job"I'm working with my Mom in the green house she works at (they raise snapdragons and calilillies).I'ts normaly 8-4 or 7-3, but "luckyly" sence its the summer and it could get over 100 degrees in the greenhouse we could go home earlyier like at 2 pm.so otherwise I might not be here unless I don't feel dead. so toodles "for now"
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Would you ever consider working on a page with me? Because coming her you have your Crono and Ecco metaphysics theroies, and at the Suikoden places I used to visit there would also be profound topics on certain subjects.I'm thinking of a game-page with games that consern deep issues, like "existance" "fate" ,Voids. stotic empty worlds. after life issues and Time travel and such. profound in dept studies of the messages these games send, like freeky "existance" theroies curtisy Final Fantasy,  like ideals preached by Sephiroth, Kefka Kuja and friends.also some games speek of "voides" (which If i start writing I'll incorperate also"voids and alter worlds, like the Far Plain in FF 10, the Zero world of FF 9 "the void" from FF5 Tides of Time from ecco, and In Suikoden 3, the antaginost shows your hero the future world, one reality out of millions of possible worlds. a perfect world because it is void of movemnet and life and color.reading your Tesseract ideas and the ToT-oligy made me think of this, these suckers in games make you think deep scary thoughts, those beyond normal comprehesion and study.keep it up, you are an insperation. Next teach me how to take over teh interweb

NOOOOOOO!Oh well.

What a fascinating storyline.

I found this place when I was surfing bored for various Ecco DotF walkthroughs. I don't remember which site I was on, but I remember seeing a link that said something around Hopefully this will bring more people in. I clicked the link and it brought me here, and that's how I started. Arkon, would you perchance remember putting something like that somewhere? Just curious. I wish I could remember the website I was at. Oh........whats the use? My memory lacks space. Sometimes I feel like a worn down computer with too many games put on it. Ugh.

An Undercaves member? Wow, nice to meet you Dreadlord.

 a perfect world because it is void of movemnet and life and color.Reminds me of The Giver.  Which, btw, is a really great book, even though it's meant for 12-year-olds it can be enjoyed by anyone older than that. Really makes you think.But don't go starting talking about books because I said that. ._.;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, okay, that's what I thought at first, but then you didn't mention that Ecco was actually the other half, so that confused me.  The whole story has kind of a mythical quality, especially with the dolphin splitting into two somehow.So, what it sounds like, is the humans and dolphins were co-existing on/around Atlantis?  They could communicate with each other?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well experience is a good thing either way, it'll help you to get a job in the future.  I myself wouldn't mind volunteering at a greenhouse.  It doesn't sound too hard, and I like plants and flowers.Have fun.

Thought I'd share these with the people here.These are in my scraps on deviant, so if you have an account there, please go and comment on them there!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
basicaly atla is both ecco and apollo. he split into ecco to save atlantis to fulfill his promise to cassandra, and became apollo so he could watch over sitna. ecco is basicaly atlas power and strength while apollo retains all his knowlege, apollo is the only one who knows who ecco relly is, who he himself relly is and everything atla used to know. also apollo is relly old while ecco is relly young.and to answer your question about atlantis, yes in my story atlantis was a dolphin human uptopia, there was a race of dolphins more intelegent then bottlenosed dolphins known as the atlantean dolphin race. but it was the gods who founded atlantis and the "gods" werent human or dolphin or relly anything, but from what you can probably figure out the "GODS" who founded atlantis were people of MU or people of the MU Levian society. And MU is actualy people who survived atlantis destruciton and traveled into the past becoming more advanced.basicaly the atlanteans are responcible for there own creation. which is another loop in the timeline, much like ecco and the asterite globe loophole.if you want to know what the "GODS" were they were originaly humans or dolphins. In Atlantean society technology rules and dolphins learned ways to overcome there limitations as dolphins so they could do things like humans could, atla for example had metal arms on his armor, small machinical grabblers which he uses like hands to build stuff.please if anyones got questions please ask them cause i dont even know if i got everything in my summery there.

And now for some info.These creatures reside on my made up fantasy world called Eutheria.Hawthry Also known as the Pocket Dragon, because it resembles a small dragon.  But it is in fact a mammal, and is about 2 1/2 feet long (not including the tail).  Very docile creatures that can be found all over Eutheria in large colonies.  They are a common site.  They are also very intelligent, and while do not have the ability to speak themselves, can understand human speech.  They have retractable claws.Pokaydra come in any colors that you would find on cats, dogs, or horses.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what are scraps anyways?I won't get a chance to comment mainly cause i'm still kinda avioding deviant, everytime i look at it i kinda get a bitter anger that wont go away. i like your creations though, my best way of creating monsters is to combine traits and features of other ones to create something new.i didnt create this character but for exmaple....the Arkon who's a stingray, he wears armor thats of a bat, stingrays cant communicate with dolphins but since he's got armor thats of a bat and since bats use sonar that gives him new abilities. which is just wierd but interesting.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Scraps are a new feature that they added to seperate your sketches and unfinished work and other things from the stuff you really wanna showcase.  Now even if you submit something as a deviation, if you put it as "doodles and sketches" it will automatically make it a scrap instead.  So it's basically sketches and stuff, but they are seperate from your gallery.  And since they're separate they get less veiws and comments. ;_;  Especially since I think some people still haven't figured out how to 'watch" them.Anyway, that does sound kinda weird.. Bats can communicate with dolphins then?  Why not dolphin armor?Well, thanks.The Pokaydra is basically like a little furry dragon, but it's kind of a cross between a cat and dog in some respects.  And this particular drawing looked like a horse at first, before I changed some things, and still does a little bit.  I mader it up originally for a story that I never got far with (the pocket dragon in that story could talk, but it ended up being too much like Nall from Lunar).The Hawthry is basically like a wyrm, but much smaller than how you would normally think of a dragon.  And I don't think wyrms usually have wings, though there's no rule that says they can't.  But the Hawthry is kind of like a hawk and an owl.  I think the idea came from a dream, or something.  I had never thought of a legless dragon before then--had never heard of wyrms or wyverns at the time.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I started to type something, but then I went back to read a bit.  So, Mu was started by the Atlanteans.  And in turn, the "gods" who created Atlantis were really from Mu.  Making it a kind of weird cycle.  At least that's the idea I'm getting.  But then how come Atlantis wasn't more advanced?  But then....hmmm....So this Poseidon was really from Mu? (What do you call a person from Mu anyway?) And then when they discovered their gods were really not gods at all, they wanted to destroy Mu because of that?  Why would they want to destroy that which gave them life?I just keep making myself the more confused the more I think about it...

yeah the Hawthry is cool, when the time comes for me to design monsters for my game i got to keep it under consideration, since my game deals with being in the sea alot it probably would end up looking like a sea horse.as for bats, bats use sonar like dolphins do to see in the dark and pretty much the same way a dolphin does, and to communicate, but theya rent intelegent to actualy communicate like a dolphin and human does, meaning talk to each other.as for the armors all the arkons wear an armor of some sort of beast, the arkon thats a stingray wears an armor that resembles a bat rather then like arkons which is more like an atelope (mainly in the mask) but nautika for example has two forms the one you seen in the art forum is her true form (well were still worknig that out) but we were gonna give her another form where she wears a "dolphin armor" but dont know yet whats gonna happen. crestoes the creative mind behind all this. i just picth alot of ideas in.

basicaly the people of MU are way more advanced then the atlanteans. why?when atlantis was destroyed by the vortex the atlanteans used there technology to escape the disaster traveling into the past. when they arrived it was tens of thousands of years before atlantis ever existed. they created the city of MU (MU means 'nothing', named that because the city the people started with nothing.) they used knowlege they had from atlantis and advanced it making them become experts on time itself.eventualy mu was devided into two societies who used levian technology to produce a special natural energy or magic. the levians started atlantis when they started not being able to get along with the magians, a negotiation began....the world was devided amoung the two groups. posiden was given an island which he would have his son Atlas rule. the people of this island where given knowlege and technology in return that they would obey the rule of the gods. not all the "gods" were bad and the only reason they were referred to as gods is because remember the people of MU are immortal. Anyways atlantis wanted to be independant and self ruling, but there were those who didnt want that, so a war broke out between mu and atlantis, and was won because mu one day vanished, destroyed by its own technology. atlantis and mu in real tales were said to be two conflicting islands, cant relly back that up but they are linked.anyways i guess people of mu are alled muvians but i havent been able to get comfortable with that, so i refer to them as people of mu even though they werent people.if you want an idea of what a person of mu looks like you have to imagine it from this. arc angels (warriors and protectors of mu) basicaly look like floating human armor, but thats it, they dont have a body, there more like beings of light. they used to be humans and dolphins but they became so advanced that a physical body was no longer needed thanks to sciences.  thats there secret to immortality basicaly.

I found this place when I was surfing bored for various Ecco DotF walkthroughs. I don't remember which site I was on, but I remember seeing a link that said something around Hopefully this will bring more people in. I clicked the link and it brought me here, and that's how I started. Arkon, would you perchance remember putting something like that somewhere? Just curious. I wish I could remember the website I was at. Oh........whats the use? My memory lacks space. Sometimes I feel like a worn down computer with too many games put on it. Ugh.I've been reading your posts and you're the most mature, polite little girl ever. I don't know anyone your age who writes like that.You've earned a flug point (I haven't dished any of those out in a while).  Wow, I got a point from Fargal? Thanks!

Hi everyone! I've loved Ecco The Dolphin since I played Ecco 1 on PC. I have now progressed onto Ecco DoTF and it's driving me nuts!

I've read walk throughs but I still cannot work it out.

Hey there, welcome to the forums.Bye bye, originality.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks, Arkonviox. It's been a while since I've gotten into creating a new character, and when the idea for her popped up, and I found this site  (again, actually... -.-), I decided maybe I could join this place, write about her, and draw her... and all at the same time, this is an awesome Ecco the Dolphin site. What more could I want? ;) Heheheh.Yeah, I think it's dutch, Ocean-Sirius! n.n But I think it actually said it meant "pure" on the site where I found the name. )
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
due to the known lazyness around here i'll link them.http://www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Chronus&amp;file=clm&amp;func=library&amp;uid=300
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 All right. :) I was thinking about doing that but didn't because of...dundunDUN! Laziness. XD Uh. Heheh. &lt;.&lt;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
anyhow im surprised at seeing any new people here, especialy you and Ocean-Sirius you both kinda came about the same time, especialy when we been in need of members, the sites been kinda dying off but i plan a big update hopefully sometime soon: i been rebuilding the intire website, ive noticed you have a deviantart account, mainly my sites gonna be somewhat like deviantart but better and mainly for ecco stuff.i also have a relly big surprise for everyone that will come along with enigma....so if you stick around maybe you'll get a piec ein this surprise.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
So far enigma can load blocks (things like the side menus which are actualy devices) and modules (kinda like the forum for example.) what i need to work on is improving it so its bug free and stable then create the profile manager and my own custom forum.I put it off for a long time (about 3 weeks) mainly cause i damaged enigma when i tried to "hack" a certain individual, using enigma tech. *cough cough*anyhow i plan to work on it some when i get my next day off.i also recently came up with a relly great idea thats a little different from enigma and i think everyone will like. those of you who remember when i  introduced the first enigma might rememebr i intrduced a little treat with it. well i plan to introduce a treat with this enigma, which will involve everyone here, crestoe and i are gonna work on it, so if people stick around maybe you'll get a good part in this project. but its gonna be a surprise from anyone and has nothing to do with enigma. its just a nice treat o.oanyways i thuoght id inform everyone about this and give you an update.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's sad to hear that. But, maybe I can find a place to link to it. Maybe on my deviantart account or through my one on fa.lk.org. n.nThat might get some people to come here. And a nice-sized update will probably help a lot too! :)That'll be great if you make this place like deviantart... in any way; I think that'd be real cool too! And, btw, how do I put up my art here? I was going to put up my larger version of my Ava (since it's all I've got worth crud of dolphin art ATM...), but I can't figure out how or where I can go to submit it. -.-
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
you just have to ask and i'll make the gallery for you to upload too//www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.php&amp;set_albumName=album78just note i only allow ecco/dolphin/ocean related artwork.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Don't worry; I'll keep all my ocean/fish/dolphin/ecco work to this place. n.n I have plenty of other places where I can post artwork that's not even related to the ocean, so no problem. &gt;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
no problem.its gonna be a while before i have any of the big updates i was talking about, to make my site better then deviant it could take serveral months.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks SO much, Arkonviox-I did it! :) You've saved me hours of screaming at my screen! ;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Btw, will most of the stuff of the forums/galleries transfer over to Enigma? Or do we have to do everthing over again?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think in summer (for me atleast) this place will revive as much as possible.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, cool!!!!!!!!!!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I would have thought the forums would be cleared, along with the galleries, seeing as the new enigma will use it's own in-built gallery system...as far as I know.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*grin* Actually, I was pondering for a while making her a Clan dolphin. But in the end, I decided an alien was a little more interesting. But, yeah. I guess since I had wanted to make her a Clan dolphin at one point, she still has some of those features... (For example, I about gave her spikes... but chose against it. So she ended up with just the rdges on her pectoral fins that might be the beginnings of them?)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
alien eh? wow, she looks so normal.there are some peoples characters here that look outer worldy Like Atlom and Crestoe...me? I "keep changing" but basicly looks like a basilisaurs (long prehistoric whale) and a bottle nosed dolphin with macral stripes and fins decoraded like the veins in a cicada wing.and "gothic markings" (unrelated)jus look in the gallery...alien...gmmmmm I drew a vortex-dolphin hybreed once.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
A vortex-dolphin hybrid? That sounds kinda cool, actually. XD Before she morphs herself into a dolphin, she actually resembles a sort of mix between a whale and a dragon; I have yet to draw her, though. I only have two pictures of her, and in both of them are of her as a dolphin.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes, it was Eao who brought me back. I didn't really have any way of hearing for myself.   I will keep posting my work here as long as I have work to post. I have a large comic run planned out for the near/near-ish future, and with any luck, I will finish Otherworld someday.

I think what I disliked mostly in the Ecco games was the fact that most of the enemies followed Ecco in a way that terribly got on my nerves. I'm talking about any kind of spiders, crabs and of course trilobites. This mostly happened in Ecco 1 and improved in ToT but there we had this stupid floating medusa and the eel thingeys.

That sounds very cool and good luck with all the work that stands behind it. Even if I don't know anything about programming I can easily imagine how many free time it costs. I think I basically understood what you meant with that and it's really impressive.

i havent got much work done cause i been needing to clean my workspace a.k.a my room.but seems with coh's latest update and moduvator doing his own update im gonna have to top them, but with the project im doing topping them will take a while. but once new enigmas done i will pretty much own the ecco community once again.

That's true. This place just suddenly burst with life and action within a matter days, possibly to a few weeks, when it first came back on it was on a crawl. Now look at it! And more and more newer people are coming as well. An omen? Maybe.

it just means people like you need to stick around and stop going to caverns of hope just because this places is dead. i hate hearing that bullshit from people when they say they dont come here because its not as active as coh, next person to say that will get beaten the crap out of. i mean i got nothing against coh but just cause this place isnt active doesnt mean you have to leave and come when its convient, we got to work together and bring this place to life, then maybe i can start doing real updates again. you can go to both sites and not go to one cause its better, whatever coh has to crank out i can top, just have faith, im the reason ecco websites still exist.

I really enjoy visiting both sites now. It never was a reason for me not to come here, because COH was more lively. I just told myself that I don't have enough time for two forums at a time and I was so wrong. That was a crappy view and I am happy to go here and there and will post frequently in both forums. No matter which place is dead, I like both of them and hope that all people will finally recognize that the old battle doesn't exist anymore. That's why it's very good to spend your time at both places. Anyway, I left all other boring forums I once attented to stay at COH and this site and I think that was a good decision. Both are unique and awsome and I'm really curious about your new projects, Arkon. It's great that the community still exists because of people like you, Psy and Silverfin and we, the members, are those who will keep it up.

Awww, thanks for all the nice welcome posts!!! I'm feeling home yet and no, I'm not really the newest to Ecco-stuff, lol.Btw, Arkon and all the others, you are surely allowed to call me Asti like everyone else does in chatrooms and in the web. It doesn't matter if you call me Asti's Worshipper, Soleila, Asti, Solly or whatever (okay, don't take this 'whatever' too seriously now). I will understand who you mean.

Yeah, it was FargalEx who totally catched my personality and designed that wondeful avatar for me.Sorry but I ignored the fact that most or nearly all of you didn't know me from COH because they simply don't go there.   I have this avatar because I am definitely the Asterite's biggest fan in the world. No one (except Arkon) knows or better said 'believes to know' more about him and I adore this guy for over 10 years now.I'm writing a fanfic-like book about Asterite that I previewed and introduced in COH and I also wrote lots of pages (70!!!) with my theories about him. Sadly I'm not a native English speaker and so my theory looks a bit strange and VERY shortened (five poor pages *sigh*) in English. If you guys are interested in this lousy old topic that had been discussed here for several times I think, I would copy my stuff here too. But be warned, I'm really obsessed.Maybe now you understand my avatar-purposes and hugging him is cuuuuute.

Basically I like the idea of thinking up suitable lyrics for the Ecco musics. I also remind the song AileronNoir mentioned but I never listened to it. The lyrics were pretty nice. Wasn't it Gabriel's Mask? A friend of mine thought up own lyrics for some music pieces of Ecco 1 and I hope she will send them to me soon. Of course, they don't belong to the game and would ruin its atmosphere but the idea is funny.Do you want to make any for all the games or do you have some certain ideas, Eao?

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow, that was a long story but it was worth the time to read it. The story is really great and creative and things flow smoothly so i understanded it well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Now I read the ENTIRE thing and I realized something.That makes sense a lot. I mean, you can erase something or scratch it out, but it is still there, even if very faintly.Good storyline there Ark.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
basicaly the way im gonna work on this is, if i change an idea i will make a slash through the old idea. and add the new one there. in some parts they are just temporary place holders to tie the story together.

<div id='container'>
I wouldn't mind seeing it, I never really thought  too much about where the Asterite came from.....I thought he was cool though. Sort of like a big DNA strand, I guess....hm....that kinda gets me thinking....O_oI don't go to CoH, frankly, because I don't really know how it works. I went to the site once and was totally lost as to where everything was.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'd definately be interested in hearing your theories about the Asterite.  I've always wondered about it.  What is the Asterite exactly and other similar questions.  And I'm also kinda curious to know where the idea came from anyway.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, I really like that. Very creative. One of those stories where everything just falls together beautifully.And now from reading all that the bright-white-text-on-black-background is seared into my retinas....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, technically 'digital painting' is pretty much just what it is. It's got some pretty nice effects for not being a super-special program or anything. Amphiptere = am-fi-teer, I believe.

Soleila are you really a realtor? And if you are, what kind?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I even don't know if this word is correct but looking into my dictionary I found 'realtor' next to my German occupation which is 'Immobilienmakler'. That means that I'm working on the property market but I am employed in a company that sells houses and flats. Luckily I don't have an own company yet. That's too stressy for me and I think I'm too young and need more experiences. My task is to find suitable flats and houses for people and so I think that I could call myself an (employed) realtor. I also offer financial advice and maybe one day I will have my own company but before, I want to study much more. It is a high risk.Man, it's so hard to describe jobs in English. Sigh.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Okay, I noticed in the other thread that there really is interest in my theory about the Asterite and so I could not resist and want to share it with all the people who do not know it yet.I also improved and updated my old post because in the meantime I discussed the topic very often and came to new conclusions that made more sense to me. So it is also interesting to read for those who already know it. Secondly I have to tell that this text has been taken from the original 70 pages long German theory text that I created to start writing my fan-book Stella Mea. Because I only translated few facts that might be interesting and proved enough to publish, it looks pretty unsorted and my language is not the best. I hope that you will understand everything I wanted to tell. It's also important for me to let you know that this is just my personal opinion and theory. Nothing has been confirmed which is sad but I just want others to read it too. Have fun and enjoy this confusing and mysterious topic.

<div id='container'>
My findings and theories about the Asterite1. General description(at first I just want to describe his lifeform)In ToT the Asterite consists of 24 pairs of globes, in Ecco 1 he has only 20 pairs. I think that this is inexplicable but my first thought was that he regained huge amounts of energy when Ecco brought him the long-time missed globe back. This new kind of completeness has probably led him to grow but Id rather call this artistic license to make the ToT levels, where Ecco had to rebuild him, harder. All the ideas that he usually grows on his own dont make sense at all because in the far away bright future he still has 24 pairs and so, an energy thrust might be the only possible explanation for the four new pairs. Each pair is revolving around an invisible center and never changes the distance from this core. He is moving in a double-helix-shape which is not so easily to recognise in the 2D-graphics of the games but easier to see in the downloadable 3D-videos. The double helix exists because every single pair is revolving, led by the force field in the center. Many people believe that the globes are connected to each other but my opinion is that only the cores gravitation field leads them and fixes the being as a whole. Maybe this core is his soul or source of life. I don't know but it is a fact that it only exists when a minimum of two globes has found each other. By 'finding each other' I mean that a new core comes to be which is only possible when you put two globes together (level Moray Abyss). Only in this case it is possible to attach the other pairs/globes. It is also interesting to see that the birth of such a new core only happens one time! When Ecco collected the other globes in levels like The Eye we can see that putting two of them together doesn't lead to the existance of a 'second Asterite' at a different place. Maybe the reason is that only one creature could exist at a time instead of more single ones. Every single globe, either connected to the main creature or not, has the desire to revolve around an energetic field and thats why they followed Ecco on their own. The disconnected globes are not able to swim without such a leading energy, they just float, pulsate and move when they are affected by a force. So he cannot put himself together on his own but looking at the level Dark Water where Ecco took one globe from him and where Asterite fell on the ground unconciously, we can see that he later must have rebuilt himself. This had happened because the disconnected globes were close enough to each other and thats why the Queen wanted to shatter him all over the oceans in ToT to prevent the possibility for him to rebuild himself. According to this, we can assume that he can rebuild his core when he is able to create a new one which only happens when two globes are close enough to each other. If not, another force (in this case it was Ecco) has to bring them at the right place to make him live again. Another point about this topic is that he only has his full power when all the 48 globes are together and when the creature is complete. When he is lacking of some of them, his 'main-part' isn't able to gather them on its own. The other connected globes always create a vacuum (these bubbles) and I suppose that this is to keep the balance. As you can see, he lives in a state of everlasting balance, he never changes and so I guess that these empty places are made for this purpose. Some people thought that he consists of single creatures but I dislike this aspect because he is talking in the I-perspective and he never uses the word 'we'. Maybe the globes are single creatures but they share one mind and act as a unit. Thats why they dont certainly act when they float around. Asterite cannot reproduce them like cells. If one is lacking, he needs this certain one back and this also supports my theory that they are not single independent creatures.There are four different colours the globes have - green, blue, red and brown - and my opinion is that they have different tasks. I really dont know which tasks this may be but in a fanfic a person thought that it could be defence (we can see that he is able to defend himself in Dark Water), control (I believe that this has to be a task because he moves himself, maybe he is even able to move from one point to another and he traveled through space somehow), memory (he saves a lot of knowledge) and sense (he can talk via telepathy, he can see and understand). This idea is funny but I like it. Who knows? He has twelve of every kind and the lack of one could mean that he is no longer able to fulfill a certain task perfectly. There also is a pattern, a certain order of the globes you can find out easily but Im too lazy to describe this now.What else can be told about his species is that he is definitely immortal. Even if he can die when he looses all of his globes, it is always possible to rebuild him. As mentioned before, all you have to do for this is putting two globes together and he starts to live again. Finding the whole rest will rebuild the same creature he had been before he died, and he seems not to loose his memory because of this. Another point is that the single globes are indestructable. A proof for that is the level Globe Holder where one of his pairs is locked up for several million years. It did not starve and I believe that the Queen had tried to destroy it but she wasn't successful. He still lives at the end and in the far away bright future and after Ecco completed him, he had his whole power back (a proof for him becoming very old or just for truly being immortal). I also believe that the globes don't need water to survive. I tried to push one out of the water in the level Ridge Water and it pulsated without returning from the surface. When I suppose that he came from the stars, it might be true that he doesn't need to breathe or even to eat. Another weird thing I once tried was leading a trilobite into his cave when I played the level Dark Water. Of course, he did not attack or eat this nasty creature, lol. I thought that he was eating because the globes are pulsating when they are disconnected from the main-creature but that has to be wrong when I suppose that he traveled through space for millions of years and looking at Globe Holder, we can find another proof that he doesn't need to eat. Or do you think that the Queen fed him? So it can be said that he is truly not a usual living animal - maybe he is a lifeform that contains the purest kind of life in itsself.The last question in this descriptive part of my text is his inexplicable change in the bright future. The globes seem no longer living, soft and pulsating. They seem to consist of crystal structures and I have no idea why. I believe that he just got older or evolved. Maybe the globes don't have different tasks in the far future or they gained new abilities. There is another VERY weird theory that came to my mind looking at the level Asterites Cave in the bright future: Any kind of creature except Asterite swims in pods and I think there is only one further exception - this strange worm thingy in the same level! I thought that this creature which is completely different from all the other creatures in this world, could be an Asterite larva. Maybe the Asterite has changed so much because he finally was able to reproduce himself after a long time and maybe he planed to become something totally new or more powerful. Of course, the worm doesnt remind to Asterite but larvas always look different. What if his globes only changed because he has some sort of a child? Lol, that goes too far but it is a new and interesting thought I think. Another change in this timeline is that Ecco cannot swim closer to him. The reason could be a water current that exists because the globes are solid or it is a further defence mechanism he invented after all his bad experiences in the present (look at the crystal in front of his cave to prevent others from entering, only those who are allowed may pass and only he allows them to escape from his cave).________________________________________________That was my general description. It's sad that we won't understand everything but that was all I found out about his species. Additionally, I left the Ecco Comics out. They contain lots of interesting stuff about his lifeform/civilisation but they are not official even if I also wrote a theory about the comics which I wont publish.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
2. History/Characterization(a try to characterize him by looking at his possible history)My views about his history are much more speculative. Describing a creature is easier than imagining where it came from and how it developed or better said, how its character had been formed. I will try to explain my points as well as possible 'It will not sing to us'). After further years of watching the developement he sensed the attacks of the Vortex and felt that life was in danger, but missing a globe and being uncomplete forced him to wait. He was not able to act on his own because he was lacking of his full power or maybe he just didn't care about Earth and the Vortex. He still waited, maybe he wanted to be whole again and so he decided to communicate one day, when Ecco would appear in his cave. Because of studying Atlantean time travel he finally knew that the unknown dolphin who attacked him in the past came from the future and so he waited for the day to talk to him. Finally the moment came and present-Ecco visited him in his cave asking for help. I think it was the first Earth-conversation in his whole life and he offered his help if Ecco would help him at first. (Maybe he had the will to protect Earth from the beginning on. Look at the conversation in Deep Water. He hesitated and offered his help before he told what Ecco would have to do. Another fact is that he knew that Earth was in danger and maybe he had changed his views long time ago and wanted to protect this world) The rest of the story is well-known. Ecco traveled back and the same stuff I mentioned before happened to Asterite. His present avatar regained his full strength and helped Ecco. I think that they became friends after that and maybe they learned alot from each other in the short time when they were together. All I can say is that Asterite's behaviour changed. He no longer waited passively in the darkness. Maybe he started to communicate with other animals, mistrusting them was over, and he begann to become a leader or a guardian. It is often said that he didn't leave because he was uncomplete but even after being complete he decided to stay on Earth forever. He probably did that because of his tasks or maybe because he felt responsible for others as he never did before. The rest of the story is also well-known. After helping Ecco, he had been killed by the Vortex Queen (She found out why she had been beaten and how to kill him, which means that she probably had killed more of them in the universe. It is also a further proof for him being not the only one of his kind). It looked strange to me that he didn't defend himself but I guess the reason is that he is not a warrior or a fighter who is able to act in such an active way (he always needs others to act for him). In Dark Water we can see that he was able to fight in a close combat but not from the distance. Maybe the Queen even knew this and so she attacked from distant above to destroy the gravitation field that holds his body together. She also knew that taking away a pair or just one globe would prevent him from helping Ecco once more and so she decided to take one to the dark future. She also knew that he is immortal and easily to rebuild and so she invented a machine, the Globeholder, to make it harder to set him free. Because of this pretty high knowledge about Asterite's species, I suppose that she and her race had fought more of his kind which leads me back to the view that he is not the only one. Without his completeness, Earth cannot be saved too and that's the only reason why she did that.All in all his death was felt by other singers which may mean that they had a connection to him. This totally disproves my first theory that he hasn't communicated to singers before he met Ecco. My idea is that he started to communicate to all creatures of the sea, or maybe just to the familiar dolphins he liked so much, because of the friendship with Ecco that existed during the short time between the first and the second game. Who knows, but this could explain a lot. During this period the dolphinkind found out that he probably wants to guide them and I guess that the encounter with Ecco finally led him to accept this new role. Well, I just suppose that something like this might have happened and so there was a strong relationship between Asterite, who had been silent before and who finally felt responsible, and the other sea animals. The result of his death was that Ecco lost his powers and had to breathe air from this moment on. I think that Asterite had projected a part of himself, maybe something he gained from his unknown everlasting source of life energy, into Ecco in the first game and the loss of his life ended Ecco's abilities. The strangest part of all was the intervention of Asterite from the future who sent Trellia to Ecco's home bay to bring him there. I think that Asterite's knowledge about time travel made this possibe but I will explain my time travel theories later. Trellia traveled to the present and brought Ecco into her timeline. The ability to take Ecco with her was certainly given by Asterite who probably had evolved in a way that made even something like this possible. When Ecco met the a little bit strangely-looking Asterite in the far away bright future, he had been warned by his old friend. So Asterite had knowledge about the split of the time flow and showing the memories of his own death was a way for him to explain Ecco what he had to do. I think only the split of time caused this chance and because the bright and true version of the world coexisted with the dark Vortex furture, the Asterite, who lived on in the correct timeline, was able to act instead of just being dead in the present (a strange way but it must have been like that). However, after the conversation in Asterite's Cave, Ecco used a metasphere to return to the present. Asterite had made these thingies - maybe another ability he learned because of his own evolution - to change a creature into another form and to travel back in time like Trellia did before. Ecco arrived in the present where he rebuilt Asterite, it happened in the way I described above and the more globes he had the better he felt. Still uncomplete Ecco finally had to travel to the dark future that still existed because it hasn't been avoided yet. He succeeded and the rest of the story is not a secret. The completely rebuilt Asterite gave him the same powers back and the Vortex were defeated (or not?). The last thing the Asterite tried to do was convincing Ecco to destroy the time machine. For some reasons (maybe the escape of the Queen-larva) Ecco ignored this and the story was over. I did not want to repeat the whole story, I wanted to explain Asterite's deep change of mind and the developement of his character. I think that Asterite totally accepted his new guardian-role and protected the ocean creatures from the very moment on when Ecco helped him first. The events in the second game, where Ecco helped him once more, even improved the connection between him and the other sea animals. I suppose that he finally became their protector and leader and this hasn't changed after Ecco's disappearance. Sadly all we know from his further history is the bright future where he acts like the everlasting calm and gentle father. The moment when he communicated with Ecco in the future was very touching and you can also see that he changed his way to talk. In the first game he gave instructions and talked in a pretty objective and direct way. In the second game his behaviour changed and I think his friendship to Ecco was the reason. As I told above, he began to guide the sea animals, sang a song to gather them and looking at his words you can see a certain difference. In the bright future he calls Ecco 'his little singer', in the present he showed a deep responsibilty and did not give up after all his bad experiences. Regarding the whole developement I think that he needed million years to build up such a connection to this world and he finally cared for Earth and the sea creatures. I also believe that he is able to move from one place to another and it could have been his own decision to leave the dark abyss where he had been rebuilt by Ecco to stay closer to the others (his new cave is near the surface in the future) but I think it is not neccessary because he has other ways to act and to communicate. Sadly I don't know if he is able to move or to look for another home cave but I'm feeling quite sure about this. It is not so important at all, the main fact is that he began to protect the world and I suppose, looking at the conversation with Big Blue, that he didn't want to do this before. He still protects the world in the bright future where he seems to live forever and he still communicates with dolphins and maybe with others. Probably he even tought them how to communicate via telepathy and how to fly through the air. I don't know but I think that the slow change of his behaviour and his personality are interesting. Going this way must have been his destiny from the beginning on but he had to learn alot and finding himself wasn't easy. I hope that his story will continue one day in the third game but looking at his long history and at his life in the bright future I think that he will not change back to someone who doesn't care for this world.____________________________________________That's all! With this part of my theory I tried to explain the developement of his behaviour and the discovery of the role I suppose he fulfills now. It was damn long and not more than a retelling of the game but I had no other way to show my views about this. He wasn't always the same and I hope my little story brings us closer to the truth!

3. Meaning/Tasks(my last post tries to conclude about his tasks on Earth with reference to the above)I think that this is a point discussed very often but I will try to post my views about this once more. I still believe that finding out his tasks on Earth is easy when you look at the design the game creators chose for him. For me he still is supposed to look like a DNA strand. That doesn't mean that he is one because a DNA cannot act, think or talk by itsself but the design seems to be a symbol. Maybe the four globe colours should symbolize the four different proteines but I'm absolutley not sure about this. Some would disagree about that point of view but for me it has to symbolize something. A DNA has two main tasks The first time was in Dark Water when Ecco had beaten him, the second time was after the conversation in the bright future by creating a metasphere that had been used by Trellia too. Because of this it seems to me that he controls time somehow but I'm not so sure. The first time could just have been some sort of an accident because Ecco had come from the present and changed something in natural history as he also did in the Level Globeholder where Asterite's globes worked like a time machine once more. Only Ecco's intervention had made the present/future possible and this action could possibly have caused the time warp. About the second time I have talked above yet. I don't think that he is able to travel in time. If he would know how to do that, he would probably have changed a lot. I am very sure that he knows how time works (maybe from the Atlanteans) which could mean that he protects the flow of time. He knows how to control the time machine ('Use this song to travel back...')/create a suitable metasphere and he knows when an accident in time happens and what to do about it. All in all this might also be one of his tasks but I don't know. The main developement and his final decision to fight for Earth caused an important meaning for all sea creatures. I suppose that he is not only their guardian or leader, I also think that he helps them with his knowledge and watchs the world to protect it and to be present forever. His other tasks, bringing life to Earth, causing evolution or guarding the flow of time are pure speculation and I don't want to think about them for longer. I'd rather keep it that way and hope that some questions are answered now. ____________________________________________That's all to say about his possible tasks on Earth and I guess, even if many people disagree, that the game creators had not chosen his certain design because it just looks cool. Regarding this, we can find out who he is, and that has to mean something. It's hard to think about it all but I hope that I did not confuse you even more with the stuff I wrote and I also hope that you enjoyed the results of my difficult work.

Yeah, that is basically a realtor, I guess...Good luck with that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, my eyes hurt from reading all that.I've got my own therioes too:The Asterite (which you said could be a creature of pure energy) could have been created by MU (Ark told us that they were beings of pure energy). Or that he was created by the Vortex (that would explain why the Vortex can "kill" him, and that he comes from "a far away world"). Maybe the Atlanteans were afraid of him (he was quite powerful) and they locked him in the cave. But, he could have become so powerful he could open and close the "cave" at any time he wants. Also, about him attacking Ecco, he could have been evil for a while (the Atlanteans would be afraid of that and locked him away). The Asterite could have been part of a alien race (like the Vortex). They wanted to come here and destroy Earth. Since the Asterite can't "move" he has others do his bidding (similar to the Vortex Queen). And since the Vortex don't want any competition, they wanted to kill him. And Ecco's friendship with the Asterite could be the same (have someone else do his bidding to kill the Vortex). Then, once they trust him, he can strike and kill them all, and rule Earth.But who knows?It's just my theories...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well Mu was actuyaly not apart of the real ecco storyline, but whats funny is i thuoght of that for my story saying perhalps the asterite was created by them, or go even as far to say the vortex themselves where created by the people of mu.but i had other ideas of the asterite being born from space in a galaxy where other asterites are created. i strongly belive the asterite was sent to earth in its early years to gather as much knowlege of earht until it dies off and the asterite has to travel to another planet for new info. i also belive there is one asterite older then the others that is the main main asterite.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I never believed that Asterite is evil and wants to rule Earth. He stays here for a very long time and protects the planet. His whole behaviour showed that he is a good guy. There is no reason for him to lie at other beings or to rule a world. He just wants to live at a calm place to control the situation. I support Arkon's theory of his creation by a main Asterite too. It sounds very senseful to me.I also think that the Atlanteans visited Earth when Asterite was already here. If there would have been a contact between them, the Atlanteans would have mention him in their library. There was no connection I think.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You never know... lol.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
there is no connection between the atlanteans and the asterite. the asterite is older then the atlanteans spanning back to prehistoric times before humans existed, which means he would even span back way before mu existed too.so ther eisnt a connection.
</div>

i had to comment on some things that are some misconceptions between programming and fact about your asterite thoery.1. General Description I tried to push one out of the water in the level Ridge Water and it pulsated without returning from the surface.that cant support your thoery there, mainly cause in a program such as ecco 2, they could have left out such detail for many reasons. one: because of the time and urgancy of how soon the game was to be released. ed annunziatta had left alot of things out of ecco 1 that he wanted to put in for exmaple the ancient dolphin ancestors that speak to ecco at origin beach. but you well supported the fact that the asterite doesnt breath because it came from space. support for this thoery is the name itself "aster-rite"Another weird thing I once tried was leading a trilobite into his cave when I played the level Dark Water. Of course, he did not attack or eat this nasty creature, lol.this is another thing that cant prove the asterite eats, two reasons one they could have left out a detail because of how fast they had to make the games completion deadline and two they had no reason to show such a detail in the first place. for example the other creatures dont eat ethier even the dolphins arent shown eating relly but if all the other creatures were eating then this thoery would be valid. but you did prove this thoery right by saying how would the globes have survived in the globe holder? that proved it more.Any kind of creature except Asterite swims in pods and I think there is only one further exception - this strange worm thingy in the same level! I thought that this creature which is completely different from all the other creatures in this world, could be an Asterite larva. Maybe the Asterite has changed so much because he finally was able to reproduce himself after a long time and maybe he planed to become something totally new or more powerful.theres a reason that worm creature looks the way it does, the same reason the moray have globes making them up, basicaly in a 16 biut game there isnt a way to make them look like snakelike creatures or in this worms case worm like creatures so they use cheap tricks like using balls to simulate the worm botty movement cause the processors arent powerful enough to actualy make a realistic worm body. so i seriously doubt this worm larva has any relation to the asterite.but besides that i cant prove anything wrong everything there is well thought out the only thing that wouldnt work is the worm thoery, that the worm was a child of the asterite, also using the games dynamics to prove points doesnt work, mainly cause if you loom carefuly enough you'll notice certain program flaws do not tie in the story at all. program flaws like the asterite eating (that was left out because the story showed no reason tro show it and the other creatures besides dolphins didnt eat anyways.) and...the globes breathing out of water (theres no reason to show that detail ethier, usualy detials like that are put when you have a game filled with detail and reaslism which ecco lacks or if you have some sort of objective. same goes with the asterites feeding, it ethier has to do something with the story, like the vortex queen feeding, or its put in to make the game detailed (which this game doesnt have that kind of detail to begin with.) just read me out im not trying to prove you wrong cause i like this thoery sounds like something id come up with, but with my knowlege of programming and how programs work i can tell you there are details you will want to ignore that dont tie into the character of the asterite and are more programming flaws.as for the globes changing from 20 pairs to 24 pairs cant explain that you seem to used program design logic there that they might of added it as an objective or...by mistake.you should check out the game gear ecco also, the globe amount might be different there too. also i can say the game gear ecco the dolphin and sega cd version seem like the most complete ecco games made, ecco for genesis is incomplete missing stuff. but the game gear ecco the dolphin is pretty much perfect storywise . ecco 2 for game gear was heavily rushed and not relly completed.anyhow im reading through this please understand besides you im the only other person who has relly examined this game, and almost every detail. your thoery is actualy near perfect, the only reason why it isnt perfect is only one man knows more about the asterite then all of us...sad to say he wont replie damn him.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
2. History/Characterizationi hated your thoery about how he might have created life on earth but when i read this:This is fuzzy logic but maybe he brought life to Earth by bringing bacteria with him. i relly like that thoery and think that makes very very good sense, please dont take this critique the wrong way your thoery is relly relly impressive, the only other person who could come up with a thoery like this is me, i wish i would have put mor ethought of detial into the asterite, i might consider it mainly for my own storypurposes but i relly like this. i could belvie that the asterite has burrowed deep under ground and has been controlling the evolution of life, but i dont want to belvie he created life, but that thoery about bringing bacteria that is very very good stuff...anyhow this is alot to read but wow so far so good. maybe you can talk with me about some of these things i posted before i add more. alot to read and take in and im kinda excitied tot alk to you about this stuff, if i add it all at once and read it all it will be hard to describe what im talknig about here. i dont want to offend you cause your thoery is very very good.

Hello, all. I just dropped in and joined after a friend introduced me to your site and the Ecco games. The art is absolutely amazing. o__o' Well, anyways, that's all I had to say. I look forward to getting to know you all ... Orca
</div>
<br />

wow i can tell your an artist but i'll ask anyways did you draw your avatar?its great to have new people come, please dont do what normal new comers do and come and vanish, we need more people here gives me more of a reason to work on my greatest project. o.o but id do it anytways even if nobody was here, but more inpiration the more sooner it will come.

Thanks for all the nice comments, Arkon. Finally I have found a person who understands what I want to say and it's so good to discuss it. As I told you before, together we could be able to finalize an ultimate theory that could be 99,9% of the truth. It's absolutely great and we should try to conclude about our different thoughts and merge the theories into a special one for which  the community was waiting in ages. Ed will never reply or confirm my stuff which is very sad but I think if we only use our analytic abilities we could find everything out. 1. As I told above I fully agree with your theory about the birth of the Asterite. An universal Asterite that lives in space could be a very good explanation and it doesn't contradict my own views. Somewhere the Asterite had to come from and I also think that it is the best possibility to create an Elder Asterite for that purpose. How old and big might this be? Wow!2. There is no connection between Atlantis and the Asterite because he is much older. When do you think did the Atlanteans come to Earth to defend against the Vortex? I think it happened later than 55 million years ago. Referring to Shadow Dolphin's idea I disagree. I don't think that the prehistoric glyphs have anything to do with the Atlanteans. They were not used by them to imprison the Asterite. I'd rather think that Asterite is able to create key crystals. A support for this thought is the crystal in the entrance of his cave in the bright future. I guess Asterite had made it as a door and he created it on his own. There are no Atlanteans in the bright future and that's why his crystal cannot be Altantean. So the crystal in front of his prehistoric chamber could be self-made too. Arkon, you also mentioned that Asterite could be older than the Mu. I think I have to read your stuff about Mu once again and I suppose that the asterites are the oldest civilisation in universe.3. About the following things If disconnected globes eat by pulsating and if they 'breathe' plancton, they would need it to survive and the level Globeholder doesn't allow such a nutrition neither would they be able to eat in outer space. The second thing is that he lives in caves that are very deep down. Plancton exists close to the sunny surface and if he would need it, he would probably swim closer to the suface. Enough babbeling, regarding these issues I can easily say that the Asterite doesn't need to breathe or to eat which makes him nearly immortal or truly immortal if you regard immortality as his strange abiility to live again and again!4.

Good luck with that.Thanks so much. I think I will really need it but currently I'm still very confused about what I truly want.

Welcome from another newbie. One thing I can tell you is that I came in and got addicted to this site. You will like it here, I promise.So you don't know the games yet? Wow, I'm jealous. I also want them to be new for me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I'm here again. Thanks to Arkon, he's the coolest!  :D So, this is my "new introduction"
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hi, welcome back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey there, welcome to arkonviox.com...who introduced you to the site and the games?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Firstly greetins folks    DOTF' on PS2... Had it when I hadda 'DreamCast'  so have already played and completed... But re-buyed it cos it's a nice game :)  Now I been tryin to get cheats for it to work but none work... They all say hold r1 r2 l1 l2 at same time whilst  pressin buttons.... Tryed all codes dozens of times... None work... Every site gives the same codes and sum folks even suggest that every code for this game could be false.... So wots the truth? and if they aint false then how do *I* make em work?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*pats fargal on the back* hey fargal crestoe loved the flash movie by the way.welcome  jade i'm glad you and i can finaly be on good terms, plus i was kinda hoping you'd come back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
*posts*I must start to post here again.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
They're all false. I think there was a real code too, but I can't remember it right now.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
im gonna make a short replie since i dont have alot of time. i'll give you a bigger replie when i get home from boring work.but atlantis began somewhere in 20,000 bc mu came into existence in 70,000 bc, the asterite as we know existed millions of years before this.as for the glyphs in the prehistoric past i do not belive at all they were created by the asterite cause the glyphs were specific that they were created by the atlanteans to help a dolphin of the future. the atlanteans had time travel technology so they could send the glyphs into the past and left them so they could exist in the future too.

huh? I tought you were always at COH? You came here also?man where has my brain been

yeah she used to be a member here a long time ago. alot of crazy stuff happened then.

i wasnt saying you had to hate coh or stop visiting it, i was just angry with people who leave here and neve rpost here because this place isnt as busy as coh.

as for the glyphs in the prehistoric past i do not belive at all they were created by the asterite cause the glyphs were specific that they were created by the atlanteans to help a dolphin of the future. the atlanteans had time travel technology so they could send the glyphs into the past and left them so they could exist in the future too.That makes a lot of sense. Sorry, I did not think about the time travel aspect. So the Atlanteans sent them back in time. Sure. Maybe Asterite just used one to block his cave and to hid from disturbing influences.

History/Characterization(a try to characterize him by looking at his possible history)I thought id continue my analyzation of this. i promise i'll write my own thoery when i get a chance, it will include ideas from yours and some of my ideas we can debate the ideas to create the final completed thoery which i will add to my site. basicaly you have the right stuff i just need to talk to you more about things.anyhow i read the whole history through. i can say we have no proof the atlanteans knew about the asterite but we know the asterite knew about the atlanteans, i belive the asterite might possibly have a psycic link with every living thing on the planet including the vortex who invaded it. big blue knew about this, "we feel great energy of thought from the asterite but it will not sing to us." i think he was telling ecco basicaly the asterite doesnt sing to communicate.as for the asterite of the future there are some things i know you kind amissed in your thoery and you will find this a little overwhelming. but the asterite of the future actualy lives in a cave on a floating island high in the sky. proof of this, ecco had to travel from the ocean on earth to floating island to floating island until he reached the great sea of the sky. the asterite probably lives on a giant floating island very high up. now as for the asterite moving, i belvie the asterite could move if it wanted too but i dont belive the asterite has left his spot since he first arrived on earth. i belvie he has been in the same spot since he first touched earth. i think it was the process of time that changed his enviorment.the only time the asterite was moved from one place to another was when ecco rescued it from the moray. i think after that the asterite has remained in that abysss for millions of years. great eruptions occured creating the floating islands. this probably occured around the asterite, a great castrohp event.the glyphs that guard his cave in the future i wouldnt take as a serious sign of the asterite trying to block acess to its cave although we can kinda understand why, perhalps he doesnt want feeding invaders and predators. but then again those glyphs were probably put there without thinking for game objective reasons, havent decided if that should remain in the thoery, but i cant think of a reason to take it out, cause we dont know if that was done to make the game challenging or the people who decided to place it there (the programmers) wanted to enclose the asterite in a safe little home and wanted to make an objective too.you had one interesting point i'll get into it in a second...basicaly when ecco first met the asterite it's first responce was "I remember you..." i felt a little agression from the asterite when he said that too, and then surprise "of course it was you! and it was i who sent you..."i dont think the asterite relly chose to become a protector, i think it was the asterites job to begin with to be a protector to begin with, but since it was missing its globe it was weak. now what would the asterite do if it was complete ecco was able to keep his powers as when he traveled back to save his pod, meaning the asterite was able to project powers to ecco from the future into the past so ecco could travel back to fight the vortex. cause the moment eccos family was taken by the storm the asterite in that time was missing a globe still while another ecco only began his quest.so if the asterite could channel power to ecco in the past, this might possibly mean the asterite exists in two spots, on earth, and in a sort of time warp, if it channels power to ecco so ecco can use in the past then just maybe it channels all its power including the power it generates to live in a sort of time warp. meaning its physical body exists here and its power exists in all times! and when it was destroyed its power was destroyed in all times. what does this mean? it means the asterite sphysical body exists here and its energy exists in a time warp whats a time warp? well now for the dark secret, the asterite hannels its energy from....the tesseract....or quite simply the tides of time. sounds insane but i cant find another way for it to allow ecco to keep its power in the past while it's complet ein the future. it emans its power exists in all times as long as its complete.i like that thoery about how the asterite may have influenced the evolution of dolphin kind, that probably would explain why they are telepathic and why the asterite seems more involved with them and how they have powers of there own. somehow they must of learned to create there own powers like what ecco had and the asterite might possibly helped them with this.oh yeah one fianl thing, the asterite of the future gives ecco a metasphere to send him back. now how is that possible? well i belvie the metasphere creates maniature black holes combine with ecco's thuoghs of where he wants to travel he was able to travel back. in the game chrono trigger there is such a thing called a time egg which can do this, combine with the dreamstone it could send you into a different part of time, or you could use it to manipulate time, like destroy a timeline at your own will, but the metasphere combine with ecco isnt enough power to change the timeline but perhalps the asterite could have such a power if it were to manipulate time, but im sure it knows of these consiquences. im also sure the asterite knows alot about time and even about the tesseract itself who knows perhalps its origins or the origin of life exists in this very place. and that the asterite is the oldest life form in the universe.anyhow i got more to analyze later i cant do it tonight since i need a break and am very tired.

for some reason I'm feeling crazy enough I'd want to try a crack at commssions, I "need" a new scanner, my second (yes H.P. gave use a replacement *angrey growl*) scanner....scaner yes "private use" scanners die quicky it seems that they only have two thousand uses.problem is, my art teacher suggested to ditch the crap and get a real one.problem -is- a real scanner I'm guessing is in the thousands. This be a professional grade scanner.thus I need people to give me a boost, working where I am won't give me a quick cash fix so i need a boost.I just fear with my lack of "quality" I'd need to work on quantidy rather than well...that realistic flavor they all crave.problem is I need the "time" Owking 7-3 or 7-4 or 8-4 or somtimes 8-3 I'd want to spend my nights with vidio games.I can't show you much now, because I don't have much examples.so, again, somthing differnt and orginal because I lack the professionalism with realism.  1)this one is is a combo of nonsenceacal "modren" art with normal art, backgrounds can exist, not exist or consist of maze-like swirly lines.  these lines can or cannot be filled with pointalism. I use Bristol, prismacolor markers, pencials and sharpies (but sharpies are made by the same people!) This one was done on the computerhttp//img62.photobucket.com/albums/v190/Eaoraptor/banderwith/dreamsteal.jpg3) "digital" I dont have it yet, but I'm going to pick up canvas that goes into the printer, a drawing will be done in photoshop or painter 8.This is a home made print (for those who don't ever here of professional printing?) you'll want and can and be happy to pay 30 dollars for (*sigh* the little I know of printing and graphic art is enough to know some get jipped)i'm not sure how to price these things, but i am gaining some acclaim but "not where it matters" (IE the interweb) don't ask for to many colors in markers, I have few, if my crayolas are still working then I'll have more.No porn or illcit activities (well priate ship pirats are ok i guess) no fan art, i'm selling this work and if they fnd me the'll sue, also i won't do the characters any justice anyway.I also do painting, oil and watercolor and can design staind glass patterns.

After our last conversation and after reading your points I think we fixed much more stuff. I will sumarize it once more to make it easier to find and my own theory has grown again. The way we work together is very good and finally we will have it. Here are the new conclusions and points I think we proved that the Atlanteans were the first Earth creatures who know about the Asterite. Maybe they even gave him the name. Asterite was born in space and I agree about the main asterite too. He traveled to Earth and the Atlanteans either sensed him or their profets found out everything about him regarding Earth history. Thus they created all the glyphs and those that are from the past or in the far future have been sent through time by the Atlanteans. I like your way to describe it by using the quote You disproved my theory and I agree with you know. The Asterite never moved from one point to another on Earth and it happened accidentally. But we have to admit that he can move because he came from space. Maybe his existance is somewhat static that he doesn't want to move. In future he lives on an island in the sky, that was true and I disregarded that. The other moments when he moved were accidents too. First, from Dark Water to Deep Water, the change of his caves came to be because he fell down unconciously after Ecco attacked him. The second change, from Deep Water to Morray Abyss, came to be because he was rebuild there. So it's ok to say that he didn't move in the game but I still believe that he could do it.3. Asterite's sensing abilities We agreed that he has emotions because of the way he talks. He doesn't sound like a machine when he says 'hello my little singer', 'you amaze me again little one' and another thing are some small points like this one here I am not sure about this. It was the result of a developement I guess and he is connected to other beings which wasn't like that in the past when he was agressive. I think we could use this part of my theory because it livens his character up and doesn't disproves other parts. It also makes sense and is interesting to see. I believe that he continued helping with his knowledge and other sea creatures often asked for his advice I guess. There is no proof against but I also agree with you that protecting Earth was not his basic destination. We have to find that out when you analysed my last part.6. The Tesseract It's for sure that Asterite might have tought the future beings. Why not. Creating a metasphere could also be an ability which he can do by using the power of the Tesseract. It's a certain fact that he knows about time and creating metaspheres is a possibility he archieved later in life. We could think about it for longer but I guess it would work in a way like that. Thanks for your Tesseract anyways - it has filled the spaces in my head!8. rebuilding/soul: We disagreed about the way to rebuild him. I still think that rebuilding him works like I described above. Put two globes together, let them rotate and attach the others. I think we should use this point and disregard the possibility of building up more of these beginnings because it's easier for the creature as a whole. We could let it like that but about the soul I think you could be more right than I. The soul is in his globes, only connected globes can act and the others just survive being unconscious. My core-theory also is not bad but we will find a way to conclude about that too. It's much more important that we agreed about the rebuilding. There is only this one choice because it makes more sense. The Asterite needs to be complete to have power and to rebuild his connection to the full power of the Tesseract. Remember, he cannot give Ecco new powers being incomplete and the globes do only change their colour from dead to living after they are reconnected with the main creature. This main creature is not the brain, the brain is the sum of all connected globes, but I'd like to call it 'the beginning of his new life'.That was all about our last points and only his true tasks still have to be regarded. If we let the character developement like it is, it will work easily and the last part is not more than a conclusion about the facts we gathered above.As I told before, the creation of our theory works pretty well like that. You come up with your points, we talk in the chat, I post my reply and here is the place to collect our knowledge and our latest agreements and conclusion. Later the stuff can be merged and partially copied I think. It's very interesting though and I simply love it.Anyway, I hope you don't mind that I repeated some stuff in my posts but I wanted to summarize which is easier than reading chatlogs that are longer than books now.

I've been playing too much Legacy of Kain the past few weeks...that, coupled with staying up till four AM listening to a bad rock group, produced this....don't ask, I just felt the need to share it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wish i could help but i dont know what your stories about.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i'm just writing a short replie for now, since im relly tired from staying up last night, i still got to anazlye part 3 of your thoery and even add some things. but i thuoght id explain the tesseract since my thoery about it has evolved.basicaly for my story "the tesseract" was named after how the atlanteans percevied it as, they used a four demensional hypercube to represent it, now you might ask why not a hypersphere? space is probably more like a sphere, well a cube shape is simple easy to measure and easyier to track as a forth demensional object, thats probably why they named a hypercube a tesseract and havent named a hyper sphere since a hypercube is widly used.anyways the tesseract is that place in ecco we know as the tides of time. its basicaly neutral time and space, a place that exists in all times in all places, to end up there is to end up everywhere....to manipulate this place is to manipulate existence itself, and from this place the effects of traveling through time are greatly felt. when the dark future was prevented it was purged somewhere in this place, it basicaly is a brocken puzzle piece that can always be put back.manipulation over time: imagine a god is controlling time, it has a giant puzzle in front of it the pieces that are connected represent the past, the pieces that have yet to be added are the future. now lets say we removed a piece from the stack of unadded pieces, the god who lays out the pieces would have to improvise creating its own piece which it belvies was suppose to go there.so in essense time is like a giant puzzle, whenever you destroy a future a new future is born created by improvisation. a way to explain this is imagine if you were doing a puzzle the the next piece that was handed to you was lost. what would you to do complete the puzzle? youd probably create your own piece and design it to somehow match the rest of the puzzle. those lost pieces still exist but are lost...this is how time works, and the tesseract provided with the right manipulation you can do many wonderful things, like make anything possible from a story. you can remove pieces add new pieces or even combine two pieces together to get a new piece. story wise i can create any character i want and not have to relly explain them, since they could of came form parralel futures that were suppose to exist. anyhow sorry to get off topic i thuoght id help you understand this tesseract better,

I do only know a very tiny bit about your story and read parts of your preview. I think I won't be able to help and you have to reveal more of your plans and details.

Well, I was trying to be vague, to save the details for the story so people will read it ;)The Caste storyline is ~3 years after Ecco's quest for the traits. Pilot has become the Prime Mover of his pod. The dolphins, with their new found abilites, have formed a loose alliance to survive and have started to explore their dying world. The soon discover that their mining station was one of several, and begin to look for survivors in the other stations, some better, some worse than the one they started in.In the beginning of the story, Pilot is exploring a station with Icarus, another mover, who is equipped with a labor harness. From there, I'm entirely sure what they're doing.

Firstly greetins folks    DOTF' on PS2... Had it when I hadda 'DreamCast'  so have already played and completed... But re-buyed it cos it's a nice game :)  Now I been tryin to get cheats for it to work but none work... They all say hold r1 r2 l1 l2 at same time whilst  pressin buttons.... Tryed all codes dozens of times... None work... Every site gives the same codes and sum folks even suggest that every code for this game could be false.... So wots the truth? and if they aint false then how do *I* make em work?You like using ... as much as me...

No, actually that results from playing too much Legacy of Kain.....the  bad rock music at 4am just helped along a bit....lol I knew you'd like it Soleila

Now that was fascinating.I always had my own theories about the Asterite, and basically everything I thought fits right in with what you guys said here.  I always thought it came from space because it was too unlike any other creature on Earth, not to mention the powers and lifespan.  And I kinda automatically figured it had some kind of link with all the creatures on Earth.   And I realized there must have been a resign it was designed as a double helix, like a DNA strand.  I thought it could have been like the core of life on Earth, like the nucleus.If the Asterite inadvertantly started life on Earth by bringing bacteria, then it's important that it lives in the ocean.  Life started in the ocean.  And the reason is because the surface was pretty much ininhabitable.  For one thing, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere.  Any oxygen that was on the planet reacted with the stone.  The first lifeforms exhaled oxygen, and that's how it eventually got into the atmosphere.  Besides that, the conditions were extremely harsh.  The winds were a lot higher than anyone has ever experienced here.  And, I think there were a lot of meteroites and volcanoes, if I remember correctly.  Basically, the surface was very chaotic.  It may not have been impossible for life to evolve on the surface, but it would have been very difficult.  And life would be very different now.  The Asterite would have had to live underwater, because even if it doesn't need to breathe air, the conditions on the surface would have made a difficult life.  Besides that, the planet is mostly water, so it only seems logical anyway for something that was able to choose to choose to live in the water.Arkon....have you ever read A Wrinkle in Time?  The tesseract is important in that story.  But they said it was the fifth dimension.  The fourth dimension is supoosedly time.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks for the ideas, Thetys. We still have to go through this whole DNA and tasks on Earth stuff but your post helped me a lot. You are right, maybe the Asterite even chose to live underwater or it happened by random. As I told, Arkon and I still need to conclude about whether the Asterite brought life here accidentally or because he had to do it but I think we will find out everything soon. Then we will have the ultimate theory for all of you. We're working on it. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, anyway, the more the merrier.Wow, this place is really lively now. So many newbies in one week. That's great!

<div id='container'>
I have to agree. Whenever I search for a new nice desktop image, I use Google image search and whenever I like a picture there, it cannot be found.It's sad that there never was a PC version of DotF to take some screenshots but isn't it possible to emulate DC games? I really want to know even if I think that the answer is 'no'.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ack you'd need a 10ghz or so pc to emulate a dreamcast, perhaps in a year or two but not right now.  Only way you'd be able to get screenshots from dof would be a console plugged into a pc with a video capture card.
</div>

I'd like to read a stroy about Pilot! That's really good idea!Good luck  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I couldnt relly give any tips on what would happen next, after ecco left that world seems all they could do is search for other survivors, and start trying to rebuilt there world on there own, they would have to find ways to adapt too so they can repaire there world.there was a war between humans the the foe which means the foe could have left technology behind, we know the foe could travel in time, and if thats true maybe pilot could use time travel to fix his world, or something else.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just giving it some serious thought now seems to help a little. I may just use it as a filler for the holes greated by the other timelines...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what holes?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Holes in my story. The driving force behind the other two timelines, for example.

the driving force between the other two storylines is there.one was the world became ruled by the foe, the other was a world where dolphins became agreesive.

There has been something thats puzzled me about ecco: the tides of time for a long time.  After ecco rebuilds the asterite using all the globes he can find in the present the asterite tells him that the final two globes have been taken to the dark future and that he has no idea how ecco can get there since ecco can't go forward in time using the atlantian time machine.  So ecco swims off to Lunar Bay and at the end of the level two vortex drones grab him and take him to the dark future...  Um but why?  If those vortex drones hadn't taken him ecco never would have been able to get there, so hence never been able to get the last globes and never beat the vortex queen.  That entire bit makes no sense to me, why would the vortex take ecco to the dark future?  Can anybody explain it to me?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Maybe a mistake?From what I hear, ToT was rushed.Maybe they added it but forgot to take it away. (Maybe Ecco was supposed to be a prisoner there.)

You know, I found that a bit odd as well, but never really thought about it. He had to get there some way, didn't he?One thing I did think about though....if you use your sonar map right before you swim up to where they grab you, you see a glyph below them. Any way to reach that that anyone knows of? Or is it just...there? I tried several different things but none of them worked, the drones just grab you.

AileronNoir, to be honest, for me it's one of the biggest Ecco mystery. But... maybe in truth the vortex - at least some of them - don't need all what happens and want it to be over? Yes, i know it contradicts with the whole Ecco storyline!  Just one more head-breaking idea of mine. Who knows...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think I was actually gonna say more but I forgot a lot of it.  But you mentioned the purpose, and that reminded me of one thing.  You asked why the Asterite stayed even when it could have left after it was complete.  Well, I think the change in character you talked about is the answer.  It seems that the Asterite, regardless of whatever reason it originally came to Earth, could have simply decided to stay because it decided that it liked the Earth or it felt it was needed there.  It made so many friends there that it couldn't bear to leave.  Or it started to feel more at home on Earth and had no real reason to leave.  Probably a combination of all of those things.  Basicallty it was the Asterite's own decision to remain.

Hello Delphina.  *waves*Great to have so many more people. :)And you know what?  That smiley sucks.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I dunno, I never even thought it was strange for some reason.  I guess I just always assumed they were capturing him.  But then there's the fact that they just let him go.  Well, maybe they assumed he wouldn't survive in the Vortex future.  Who knows.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Delphina? Hello and welcome too! :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That is very strange. I wonder what the creators were trying to set up when they were building it. There must be a reason, but what?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
First, thanx for posting that, Arkon. I've already read something like that somewhere, but then couldn't find it anywhere. BTW, the story about Solon was used by A. Almistov, who wrote a novel called "The black sun of Atlantis" or smth like that. I have never read it, only heard much.Second, greek gods really had many wives. And, what is the most strange, different sourses give different names of the official wifes. For example, according to different sourses, either Metis or Themis were the first Zeus wife before Hera. What about Posseidon, he had several wifes, but i don't remember whom.  I'll check it. And, thirdly, Tethys, that's a good idea about Avalon! Who knows, after so much time passed since then, and everything's mixed.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanx guys. Tethys, it really does  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
The answers are there, you just got to put things together.The vortex steal two globes; right after that trellia takes ecco into the future where the asterite tells ecco to rebuild it. when ecco came back thats exactly what he did, and the vortex didnt relly expect ecco to do this.qoute from the game "you must rebuild the asterite to save earths future"when the vortex from the dark future seen ecco rebuilding the asterite they relzied this would put there future in jeaporday, perhalps ecco would have found another way without there help so two drones where sent back to capture ecco and process him through the machine. who knows: had the vortex from the dark future not intervene ecco could have.1. found another way to the dark future.2. fought the vortex queen without restoring the asterite.both those were too risky, and the vortex from the future cant kill ecco alone, but a whole world of them can. so i think that proves it right there.

if your using internet explorer two things might help.first you could delete all your cookies and history letting you work from a clean start. to do that goto tools and internet options  and delete cookies and history.also you could go to privacy and set it to medium or all the way to the bottom to low, and that hsould get them working properly.make sure you goto apply and okay after that, if you cant do that then you'll never get it to work.

welcome dephina, maybe you can check out some of our atlantis and my story and other myths section and you can tell us a bit of what you know.

<div id='container'>
I think they should meet other dolphins, maybe hostile ones, and should try to convince them tp repair the damage. I also like the idea of time travel. It's always good in a game but I still don't know which timelines you want to include and how to connect them, Artreus.One question: After Ecco left, he made this future impossible, right? I'm confused about this 3-year-thingy.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
And Arkon's logical mind comes to the rescue.

Hello, old pal! It's wonderful to see you around at this place and you should really read the Atlantis theories here. This site has awsome stuff!Btw, Thetys: When I first came here, I fell in love with your avatar. It's somewhat cute and great. Where is it from?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I also wondered about that thing but at least I found out that the Vortex are either dumb or self-confident. I think these drones wanted to imprison Ecco because they wanted to prevent him from rebuilding the Asterite completely or just because they knew that he would find another way. There is another part that shows the Vortex' way to underestimate their enemies Maybe they catched Ecco for food as they catched other creature too and maybe only the Queen herself has the ability to recognise Ecco as the prime enemy and the others don't know about this. Makes sense.

you cant assume this about the vortex, the vortex are more like ants and bee's in fact thats exactly how they are, and they function exactly the same way.theres a hive anbd drones if they function anyway its not out of any intelegence thats just how they work, they follow commands of the queen more.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, I always have the stupid habit to compare every behavior which human characteristics. We don't know what they think and how they exactly thought when they captured Ecco.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thats obvious they didnt think anything, they were performing a function without a choice, there function was to protect the hive, but knowing that they couldnt defeat ecco alone they brought him to the hive, they were probably trying to capture him like a spider would and cacon him like they did with the globes but they knew two of them couldnt do it alone.also they probably underestimated even if ecco got the globes he'd be able to return back.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
One question: After Ecco left, he made this future impossible, right? I'm confused about this 3-year-thingy.The story is based on the timelines assuming they do exist after Ecco leaves them. The Clan storyline begins with the void of power created by Mutaclone's death, and the 'normal,' storyline begins with the Guardian loosing its power.In contrast, there is no plot to the Caste version. Sure, I can go on about how bad things are, but that only gets me about halfway to where I want to be.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
it seems like after ecco left all those worlds nothing else happened. but in eccos normal world i assume they still got the foe to worry about, i mean they never relly destroyed all the foe right?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
This is a site my sister stumbled across somehow...anyway thought I'd tack it up here, considering all the other odd sites there have been here.....http://www.go-quiz.com/warning-label/warning-label.phpAnd I couldn't get it to post mine here.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You know, I found that a bit odd as well, but never really thought about it. He had to get there some way, didn't he?One thing I did think about though....if you use your sonar map right before you swim up to where they grab you, you see a glyph below them. Any way to reach that that anyone knows of? Or is it just...there? I tried several different things but none of them worked, the drones just grab you.Maybe a mistake?From what I hear, ToT was rushed.Maybe they added it but forgot to take it away. (Maybe Ecco was supposed to be a prisoner there.) There again. If it really was rushed then it could have been a feature uncompleted.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's right. Ecco only destroyed one ship, so whatever happened to the rest of the fleet? It must still be out there, but what's it doin'?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
How did she find it? It is very...interesting. According to this, it is advisable to keep me away from fire and flames for safety purposes. Kind of neat. I wonder what gave the website creator the idea.

So basically I was right.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I was thinking about the name Asterite.asterix, astonomy, astrology, astronaut, asteroid....But stellar also refers to stars.  And what does an asteroid have to do with stars?  I can't remember if it's asterois, meteors, or comets that come from supernova explosions...Anyway, it's interesting that asterite is so similar to asteroid.  It's like metoer, meteroid, and meteorite.  asteroid--&gt;asteriteBut then, that probably has nothing to do with anything.

<div id='container'>
To Arkon) Of course i will! I like it here wery much, really! And, if i'll have to add something about Atlantis after reading, i will. Thank you!To Soleila)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow! It'll take me ALOT of time to read all this discussion (to find out what Soleila added to her theory). And now  i have a small contribution to yr "Description" item. This idea came to me yesterday, and i decided to carry it out - these are the Asterite's physical characteristics. As we don't know what substance he consists of, and also what Ecco's length is (i took it as a mesure unity), these results may be incorrect. In brackets i give the formulars for this case; if you disagree with the meanings i took, you can put there yr own and count by yrself. So, let's take that Ecco's length (L) is 2 meters. Then the distance between the two globes - or diameter of the circle each globe strikes - is about 3 meters (1.5*L). The mass of each globe is 0.56*p*L, where p stands for the density of substance the Asterite consists of. "p" is surely less than 1 kilo per cubed meter. When i was working upon this i thought it was about 1/2, but i think it's even less. Ok, let's take it 1/2. Then the mass of a single globe is about 4.71 kilos. Each globe makes 19 turns in a minute, or nearly 0.32 turns in a second. The power, which holds each globe on its orbite, is about 28.6 newtons (or 1.7*(L^3)*p). The power of attraction between the globes in a pair is about 98.6*10^(-11) newtons, and power of repulsive is -98.6*10^(-11) newtons (ideal case).  Each globe moves has speed nearly 3.02 meters per second (or 1.51*L). While moving, each globe posesses kinetic energy which is nearly 2.56 (or 0.64*(L^3)p) joules.  The power of attraction between the two nearest  globes in a chain  is  nearly 370*10^(-11) newtons (or 2.8*Lp*10^(-11)).  Let's take that the distance between the nearest globes in a chain is l and is nearly L/3, or 2/3.  Then the length of a single Asterite's chain is about 39 meters, the length of the whole Asterite is 28 meters. That is. I hope that'll be somehow helpful.   :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OMG!That's very cool, Delphi! I also calculated the Asterite's length but I supposed Ecco to have a length of 3 meters. He is a male bottlenose dolphin and that's an average size. Thus I came to a height of 42 meters and a globe size of 1 meter. That's funny. Lol. But wow, all the others things you added are just extra-cool. I like that and I did not know that you are good at physics, the strangest subject at all. Lol. Thanks again!About the name, we translated the suffix and the prefix, so aster-ite, and it looks familiar to us that this name should mean that he came from the stars. He is a living, thinking and feeling animal, the game creators chose a DNA-symbol for his design which is a main part of the upcoming theory we are working on, and we don't think that the name should lead to the association 'asteriod' or 'meteroid' to let him be a mineral from space.

Jeeze. x.o  That musta taken a lot of work to calculate that stuff.  How many feet is 28 meters? ._.Anyway, I was just making abstract observations.  I didn't think it meant anything, but it was just something I thought of.  Although it did make me wonder what exactly does the prefix -ite mean.  I think it means of or from, but what is a meteorite "from"?  And I don't know that aster really refers to stars.  It might refer to space.  Because stellar refers to stars.  But that doesn't mean they can't both mean the same thing.  Anyway, aster is the same as astro.  Astronomy, the study of the stars, or of space.  Astronaut, one who travels into space.  But then there's asterix * so maybe it is a star...Nevermind me, I'm just babbling.

I never believed that Asterite is evil and wants to rule Earth. He stays here for a very long time and protects the planet. His whole behaviour showed that he is a good guy. There is no reason for him to lie at other beings or to rule a world. He just wants to live at a calm place to control the situation. I support Arkon's theory of his creation by a main Asterite too. It sounds very senseful to me.I also think that the Atlanteans visited Earth when Asterite was already here. If there would have been a contact between them, the Atlanteans would have mention him in their library. There was no connection I think.Another tie-in for the "Ecoo meets Chrono trigger" hmm Arkon? If this theory about the Asterite is true, it would make it no diferent from Lavos ne?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wait, I tried to prove that the Asterite is a good guy, a protector of Earth, after several circumstances forced him to change his mind. Lavos is a bad guy as far as I know so there IS a difference.

In truth there is enough evidence to theorize on who this came to be but not enough for anything BUT theory. For all we know they could have intended for the globe holder to assimilate Ecco with the globes, 2 flies with one swat sort of thing. Maybe they used the holder and the near lack of defence leading to it to trick Ecco into thinking he had won, found his proze and could escape so he would let his guard down and get caught or killed, not counting on him avtually defeating the holder.  All we really can do is guess as the evidence leads up to a certain point and no farther, leaving us to guess at the rest. Most of the abovementioned theories are sound in their own way, who knows, maybe they are all right? :?

Simmer down Tethys. So what if someone doesnt always spell right, no need to make a big deal over it. Over specialize and you breed in weakness. Itsslow death.You misunderstand me.  I don't care if someone makes an honest mistake, just that it's important to correct your mistakes if your going to publish something--you want it to look professional.  But what does irritate me is when people type like shadow_dolphin did a few posts above (though he was doing it that way on purpose apparantly).  You know, when people shorten "you" to "u" or "for" to "4" cuz they're too lazy to write any words that have more than two letters.  Go ahead, I don't mind if you make an error in spelling, but if you're obviously spelling something wrong like that on PURPOSE, that just annoys the hell out of me.  There's no reason to do it besides laziness and all it does is make you look like a moron.Oh, and Soleila, you're English is great.  I didn't even realize it wasn't your native language!

I've told this story enough times, copy and paste from my DA page...I shall tell you the story of how "boh" originated.One day I was having an audio conversation with my good friend via the interweb. Suddenly, his pc froze on something I was saying, and his pc kept repeating "boh" every 5 seconds. He thought I was mucking around and kept telling me to stop. Eventually he rang me up to tell me to stop...I could hear myself saying "boh" in the background.Since then I've stuck "boh" in various places, especially in my drawings.

Hello everyone.In the Soundtrax you may have seen my original Medusa Mix.Well that song was done in 2002 and I DO believe it is time for some new material here. Me and another person had planned on remixin the whole soundtrack for this game (6 songs?). Well that didnt get any further than a couple of Demos. Well its just me now and someone has to do it...and since i want to do them all in my own style, I will be the one to remix them. If anyone heard the Maze of Stone demo i had here in these forums a looong time ago well....that song was garbage and is being rewritten. I am starting with Vents of Medusa and Maze of Stone on this new project. I may start on Sea of Darkness soon too as i have ideas for that song also (wow see thats half the songs right there heh).Well enough talk, here is a link to my new medusa mix that I am working on. http)(if there are typos....its late and im not checkin heh)

Oh, and Soleila, you're English is great.  I didn't even realize it wasn't your native language!That's really nice. I simply love the English language because of the reason that you are able to talk to nearly any person in the world. Message boards and chatrooms are a cool way to practise and I have to confess that my school English never helped me. I also didn't expect that people won't notice that I'm from Germany and that is a very nice compliment. Thanks.Btw (By the way) Fargal, I didn't understand a word but since I know your fargalish randomness(tm) I even don't try it.

Wow!!!I have heard a lot of Ecco remixes (not all of them, I know) but these were the best. You have a very good sense for music and I love your style. I hope that you will go on and remix all the well-known Ecco songs from the entire series because I think that sounds like something new. Very good, really, and if you tell that you needed only a couple of hours for that, I'm impressed. Esp. Maze of Stone was great. Good luck with the further ones.

I often wondered what we know about these things, how they work and where they came from. The metaspheres are a part of ToT and a glyph explained that the Asterite created them to change Ecco into other creatures but there are some things that confuse me about them.The first time in the game we see a metasphere is in the bright future where it changed Ecco into another lifeform. The primary purpose of them is to bring Ecco at other places. An example They only appear in the present when Asterite is nearly (???) complete and so I guessed that a complete Asterite is able to make them but they also appear in the dark future where we can just find two of Asterite's disconnected globes (is that right? are there metaspheres in the dark future?). I asked myself how this is possible, how to they work and why do they even allow time travel later? What do you think, does the Asterite have to be complete to make them? Is their time travel ability only possible after millions of years when Asterite has evolved? Are the Vortex who use them in their machine also able to make them or do I have to play the game again because I mixed everything?I think I should take a closer look at them. That's pretty interesting!

seee look all this positive feedback is good hehehei cleaned up the maze of stone demo a bit with new pads/bass/ snare that is there by accident and other stuff.that is NOT the ending lol just where i cut it off because what comes next is still not even close to written.thats about it, enjoy! i dunno how long this update everyday thing will last, but at least im getting a quick start hehThanks again for the kind words everyone //66.221.70.133/sadorf/Music/Maze_of_Stone2.mp3bye bye!

........?You know, I never really thought about that. I knew that the metaspheres around in the Present are there because of the one the Asterite sends back in time with Ecco after thier meeting in the future...I guess they multiplied and spread around?....But where were the ones in the Dark Future? (been awhile since I've played through the whole game, I'll have to do that again some time) As for the ones when Ecco gets grabbed by a drone and taken to that Machine-like place that turn him into drones....hm. Wonder where they came from, did the Vortex just abduct them?You know, I think I'm going to have to start giving deeper thought to some of these type of things....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I never thought of that myself.  I guess I just figured they were placed for conveniance, not necessarily tied to the story.  But then, it seems there was a great deal of thought put into every element of the game, even small ones.  So it makes sense to think there's a reason behind it.The only place I can think of where there are metaspheres in the dark future is when Ecco gets swallowed by the queen, or captured, and ends up in that place where he turns into a Vortex.....whatever those are.  There's a metasphere right at the top that changes him.But it's been a long time since I played it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I checked it more carefully and figured out that there are metaspheres in the bright future and in the present. The Vortex ship where Ecco finally fights the Queen is located in the present and NOT in the dark future. In the dark future are NO metaspheres and that shows a connection between Asterite and these things. If we can only find them in the present, where an unconcious Asterite still lives somehow, and in the bright future, where the evolved Asterite even uses them for time travel, we can assume that they can't be created in worlds where Asterite isn't present like in the dark future. That's all I think but I also like Mutaclone's idea that one was sent back in time and spread in the present where it found a way to connnect to the unconcious globes of Asterite. Whatever, this kind of connection is necessary.Hey, I love to think about every single pixel of that game and I'm doing that for years. Sorry but I can't help myself and have to analize everything like our admin does.

I am still putting random stuff together to create my character's story complete, but I plan to have it continue off a story I am currently working on. Bascially she is just a normal Spinner Dolphin, who is a mamber of the Eclipse Pod, given the name by passer-bys for their interest in the stars and the world beyond. Upon her dorsal fin is a blurred mark resembling a shooting star, (Which I created based from a story I read long ago.), but thinks nothing of it. However, this simple marking shows what her destiny truly is, and her secret lies in her song. A talent she keeps as a secret, not wanting others to find out for an unknown reason, is that her song can gain the trust of fish. Normally timid and frightened easily, fish will come bravely up and swim around playfully when she sings out to them. A gift she uses for fun, she soon finds out she is forced to re-awaken Ecco from some sort of abyss dungeon, and her song is the tool needed to save the many timelines branching off from the main timestream. A mess in the balance of energy has occurred, and if this is not corrected, the timestream itself will collapse and disappear into the abyss of nothingness. Time itself will come to an end. That is basically just a preview that I will need to work on, but I can't start on it until I complete my first story. I coudn't think of a name, so I just put some letters together and came up with Neria. (Near-ia) It stuck, so that's it. There's my story, and to Raeckon, now that you do have an avatar, will you be creating a story for it? Just curious.  :)
</div>

My avatar was an idea of FargalEx who designed it. The primary reason is my screenname on COH which is Asti's Worshipper but Soleila is also the main character of my book Stella Mea. She is a human woman and has a connection to the Asterite without noticing it. During the whole book, they fall in love with each other but before I write down the whole contents, I'll copy my old COH post He says what he wants, calls 7 creatures who were true during the failed gathering and reveils his secrets. He even tells them about a second gathering in which he plans to tell everyone who he is, to end all misunderstandings and to regain the connection between the ocean animals and their leader but before, he wants Soleila, the person who is responsible for his deep change, at his side and creates a way for her to live underwater. To make it shorter, Asterites group succeeds in bringing her to him, teaches the ignorant girl and shows her parts of her own fate which she doesnt accept from the beginning on. Meeting her, he finds out what love is and both are more than fascinated from each other. Soleila never knew love but the way their relationship developes is like higher justice. Sadly it doesnt help, her old personality wins, she lies at him, is too proud to love and so she hurts him badly. Later she even causes an event that endangers him and the whole world (his death would end the ocean's balance and finally kill it), betrays him and suffers from her own conflicts and from the huge conflict in the ocean where she is hated with few exceptions only. There even is an important conflict between Soleila and Asterite because she is his opposite. While he is emotional, gentle, loving, shy, peaceful and somewhat pure and perfect, she isnt able to live with his perfection and all the love he gives her which desires too much from a person like her. Soleila doesnt deserve someone like him and these deep conflicts have to be solved until we might see a happy ending. There is a lot everyone has to explore and to find and so the main intention of my book (you have to beat yourself and risk everything before you find your true way home) is shown in many cases. Both characters have to give up themselves completely for several times and their love is avoided by a battle in the foreground and by their inner problems in the background. I'll better end here before you know the whole book, lol.

John Lilly is probably the most famous Dolphin Researcher of all time; He being the fella that attempted to establish interspecies communication between Man and Dolphin, and it was also his work that discovered that the Dolphin's Brain was significantly more evolved than the Human Brain. He is also of the most significant philosophers to come out of the 1960s wave of Optimism. and oddly enough one of his major contributions to the world of Ideas was something he named Earth Coincidence Control Office. I quote from the man himself."In ones life there can be peculiarly appropriate chains of related events that lead to consequences that are strongly desired. After such experiences, one wonders how such a series of events developed; sometimes there is a strong feeling that some intelligence (greater than ours) directed the course along certain lines which It/He/She was/is programming. Several years ago, I enunsiated a format for such concatenations of events, somewhat "There exists a Cosmic Control Center (C.C.C.) with a Galactic substation called  Galactic Coincidence Control (G.C.C.). Within which is the Solar System Control Unit (S.S.C.U.), within which is the Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.). The assignments of responsiblities from the top to the bottom of this system of control is by a set of regulations, which translated by E.C.C.O. for humans is somewhat as follows1) You must know/assume/simulate our existence in ECCO 2) You must be willing to accept our responsibility for control of your coincidences. 3) You must exert your best capabilities for your susrvival programs and your own development as an advancing/advanced member of ECCO's earthside corps of controlled coincidence workers. You are expected to use your best intelligence in this service 4) You are expected to expect the unexpected every minute, every hour of every day and of every night. 5) You must be able to maintain conscious/thinking/ reasoning no matter what events we arrange to happen to you. Some of these events will seem catachlysmic/catastrophic/overwhelming there is no escape from it. We (not you ) control the long-term coincidences; you (not we) control the shorter-term coincidences by your own efforts. 7) Your major mission on earth is to discover/create that which we do to control the long-term coincidence patterns "Cosmic Love is absolutelely Ruthless and Highly Indifferent ECCO The Dolphin. Is the name on Purpose? or a "Coincidence"?Bobcheck outwww.johnclilly.comand/orwww.deoxy.org

Hm.....interesting. I heard a theory somewhere that Atlantis was actually Antartica, only it didn't sink into the sea it just drifted away...But if there's actual evidence its there, I do hope they excavate it...of course then it would no longer be a myth if that was found to really be Atlantis...

I can remember few things about the secuel game of Megadrive. The place where Ecco is teleported after complete the Asterite is located in the present, where is the ship and few dolphins fightning evolved drones (I think I must to create a topic about that thing cause that drones thrilling me somehow)Supossadly, that place is few days (months?) later after Ecco departed to the Bright Future with Trellia, time profited by the Vortex to construct their base, threath dolphins and "contaminate?" the seas with a tick layer of "mucus?" in the surface. So, is in the present and not in the Dark Future where appear that Metasphere inside the "belly" of the Vortex Daughter...Well, only a little nitpick   (and opportunity to practice my poor English   )

Yeah, I told that in my last post and my confusion is over. There were no metaspheres in the dark future. They were placed in present and bright future where Asterite lives to create or maintain them.Do you really think that a few months passed since Ecco returned from the future? Interesting. I often wondered about how many time passes during the levels.

That's very cool. I think noone was truly interested in them before and so, noone built up a true complete theory. Good luck for that. I'm curious to read it but I'll stay true to MY subject, lol. Anyway, I see some great discussions coming.

The only true reason behind that all is very easily to explain: The two games, I mean Ecco 1/ToT and DoF have nothing to do with each other. We could try to connect them speaking about parallel universes but I guess that we rather should say that David Brin, the creator of DoF, had 'no idea about what happened in the first to games' (quoted). And if we don't connect their timelines, we could just say that DoF is a game with a main character called Ecco that looked like the orginal Ecco but truly wasn't the same.*goes the lazy explanation way*

you cant come up with that thoery relly, theres nothing to back it up.we know there were vortex in atlantis, if in ecco one those creatures where there then your thoery would make more sense but they werent, meaning they are indeed vortex and not creation of the atlanteans, there was teleport rings in ecco one as well.mainly the only reason why those magic arms dont look to different in the dark future was the game developers didnt have time to finish the game, and add more enemies into it. they just reused what they could to make up for it but i belive they intended to have different bag guys there.

 we know there were vortex in atlantis,.When? In the game 1? (sorry if I'm bothering you a lot but I wanna know reasons)Vortex larvas in ToT doesn't count. Why Magic Arms are Vortex minions?

<div id='container'>
who said vortex was located light years away, qouting the game again."when the earth and vortex have a clear path the vortex feed upon the earth.""this occurs every 500 years"but its more possible that a blackhole opened the warped ecco from earth into the tube.but your thoery about a ship is completly wrong, especialy when we know the machine was located on vortex itself, so throw that part of the thoery away.Yez zir. And the game says something like "their planet is situated in Cassandra's constellation" and that are lightyears from the Earth. Maybe I must to release something about the star-lanes.  I deleted the post with the origins by the way   Recently I'm investigating more seriusly that now I have more info about it for play (years ago I haven't that info and actually my memory fades, and that's why I'm playing again ToT with the emulator; how nice program!

the way id like to see it, id like to imagine defender of the future was actualy a doppleganger timeline of the real ecco universe, meaning its a shadow timeline mimmiking the real one.and ecco in that is a doppleganger of the real ecco which explains why he seems to be different from the real ecco, and the foe are dopplegangers of the vortex. usualy a doppleganger is a shadow being that mimmicks a real one, has the same characteristics but is slightly different.One entry found for doppelgnger.Main Entry or doppelganger /'d-p&amp;l-"ga-&amp;r, -"ge-, "d-p&amp;l-'/Function German Doppelgnger, from doppel- double + -gnger goer1  DOUBLE 2a b  a person who has the same name as another

nice thoeries but thats not relly how it works.the vortex do have a home world, the planet vortex, if you seen the mega cd movies the tube and machine are on this homeworld. the vortex function much like a combination of bee's with a hive, ants and a hive and spiders. there made up of a queen, drones, and the hive is much like a bee hive with combs.we can say basicaly they are somewhat intelegent but there integence has nothing to do with there technology, they are like i said before like ants and bee's performing a function the intelegence they developed only comes to use when stalker there prey.somehow like humans the vortex evolved and became resource greety, everything around them became used up, so eventualy they had to adapt there survival by inding other planets to feed upon.i dont think it was there original intention to actualy take over earth and root upon it, the queen did that later when she was defeated by ecco and wanted revenge, ecco attacked her and she retaliated by attacking the asterite, instead of returning home to her planet she took root on earth and started a new machine.

i have only two explainations for the metaspheres, one they are made of a chemicle when a living thing is exposed causes a reaction or morph to occur, there is also the metasphere that creates time travel so its possible the cheimicles when in contact with a living being causes a blackhole to open.how the asterite created these? well they seem sorta like magic, and science, something created out of a dream of thought, and the only place that you can use to create things from a dream of thoughts are is the tesseract.

the way id like to see it, id like to imagine defender of the future was actualy a doppleganger timeline of the real ecco universe, meaning its a shadow timeline mimmiking the real one.and ecco in that is a doppleganger of the real ecco which explains why he seems to be different from the real ecco, and the foe are dopplegangers of the vortex. usualy a doppleganger is a shadow being that mimmicks a real one, has the same characteristics but is slightly different.One entry found for doppelgnger.Main Entry or doppelganger /'d-p&amp;l-"ga-&amp;r, -"ge-, "d-p&amp;l-'/Function German Doppelgnger, from doppel- double + -gnger goer1  DOUBLE 2a b  a person who has the same name as anotherOh, wow   Really interesting.

Nope, I didn't watched nor played the MegaCD game   but thanks by share that point about The Machine   But is extrange, how will arrive the resources gathered by the drainpipes if their homeworld are far away from the Earth? x_XAnd yep, the Hive and The Machine (with Stomach included) are not high technology. Is more like an organical intestine (seemengly The Machine is like a sponge lifeform) I think the Hive in the Earth recived a bit of help from the technology from the Dark Future   but I may include my version of the Queen's history in a while.If you have more data about it, I have wishes to hear it  :D (cause only I played EtD, ToT and DOF and that years and years ago, and I have slightly information saved in my memory)

Wow, that is some simply incredible work with MS Paint.  I never saw anyone do something that good and that detailed with it.  And I like the effect it gives.  Really neat.I like the stained glass one, too.  Very cool.

That's cool, Eao! I wish I could do something like that with MS Paint and you are right. It's unbelievable because my MS Paint works look like a bunch of dots and lines. Very well done.

<div id='container'>
Um...where did the pictures go?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's interesting. They look kinda liquid but are surrounded by some sort of a bubble and they definitely look similar to Asterite's globes. I never asked myself how they were made but you could be right. I agree about the theory that esp. the time travel metaspheres could be created by using a connection to the tesseract. It must be like that and we know the reasons from our very own theory I guess. About the morphing, I don't know. That's confusing because morphing is more unbelievable than time traveling for me and I even don't know why.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I believe that they are travelers but I also believe that they have one homeworld. Arkon is right, it was not their original plan to stay on Earth and regarding their 500 years circle, I would rather say that they have many food sources (other planets) and that they travel around to gather food with their machine. After that, they probably return to their homeworld but referring to this, I'm asking myself why their Queen travels with them. Wouldn't it make more sense if only the drones collect food on several planets and take it home in between? Do you think that they only have one Queen? Insect hives have one only, the hive dies if the queen dies but there are alway more than one independent hive.What do we know about their development? I never thought about the topic, my Asterite-obsession distracted me but it's cool to read your thoughts.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sorry for the double post but another question is coming to my mind:What do you think about the metasphere in the Vortex ship (present)? Did the Asterite create it to help Ecco, which would be pretty strange because I think that the drones would have tried to avoid that, or do you think that the Vortex have metaspheres too?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
First, what is the Tesseract?And answering to the last question:I think the Vortex cannot create metaspheres, because if they can, why to use the Time Machine? The metaesfera is in there to help Ecco, and I think Asterito (in spanish xD) can warp them wherever he want (undewater, in the sky, etc)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What do you think about what is it? A normal creature from the cool future? An Asterite's ally?  First Magic Arm is in the game for bless Ecco with the Song of the Hunter, but in the vortex Future, there are a mutated one who attacks Ecco with vicious purposes (and, if I remember well, there are another normal Magic Arm who attacks to Ecco too but I can't remember where exactly)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Asterito (in spanish xD)*melts* How cute!Yeah, I agree. Anything else doesn't make sense and Ecco had to morph into a drone to go further. I think the metasphere has been placed there temporarily and the drones didn't notice it because they absolutely don't know anything about metaspheres and about Asterite's ability to create them. Maybe he uses the tesseract to send them where ever he wants.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 informal release   Hive organizationI'm agree about the original plan of the Vortex Queen to not invade the Earth in the begining (but I'm still disagree with the weird version of the MegaCD game about The Machine placement) The Queen travels with the Harvest Hive (I'm retouching a bit my Vortex theorema xD) probably because:-She knows about the Asterite's new home and wanted to "visit him"-She is amused by the big quantity of food in the Earth and wants to taste it personally-She were weakened after a battle (who I will explain in a next post) and needed quick a source of food to prevent herself from a near death-She was bored of lay in the Main Hive and wanted to travel and secure the new source of food from the Earth

who said vortex was located light years away, qouting the game again."when the earth and vortex have a clear path the vortex feed upon the earth.""this occurs every 500 years"but its more possible that a blackhole opened the warped ecco from earth into the tube.but your thoery about a ship is completly wrong, especialy when we know the machine was located on vortex itself, so throw that part of the thoery away.

Oh, Raeckon, by all of this you make me publish my vortex-related theory... Not now, but i hope that tomorrow it'll be ready. The theory you posted really rox!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
More technical details!! Hm. I did wonder about those, too. I personally never liked the looks of them, they creeped me out...didn't think they were nice things in the first place. Guess the Vortex influence must have mutated them, or something.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually you can stop Ecco from becoming a drone when you get transported there. I got sick of being turned into a drone, you move so SLOW....the second the screen comes on hit the direction button hard in either direction and you should dodge the metasphere. As Ecco you can move alot faster and easier.....as a drone I typically got squished in the moving walls.

goddammit, i didnt even have to read the replies to figure out how you guys are in the wrong direction. the machine is located on the planet vortex itself not in space in a ship, the tube was originaly intended to be a giant water tube (which was created from the vortex) that lead to a tube on the planet withen the hive on vortex. the hive is on vortex, just belive me when i say this stuff i know what im talking about and i'll prove it to you.heres a qoute that explains more then enough:"When you traveled to the vortex world the queen followed you back to earth."that coems from the asterite where he pin points proof that the machine is located "in the vortex world"also the movie in the mega cd version shows the machine is in the "vortex world" ed annunziatta the stories creator had creative control over the movie.if your gonna come up with a thoery you need to research from what the game gives you, otherwise they are too random.but i like the fact you are trying this, but i belvie it needs some buffing up, before its ready to become a thoery people can relate any too.also just to make clear the vortex didnt evolve on earth, they were created by the queen and enchanced. woute from the booklet "the vortex queen is creating a new race of vortex"

the tesseract is my word for "the tides of time". it is a place where time and space are neutral; meaning to be in this place  is to be everywhere at everytime. i figure this place exists ethier in the fourth or fifth demension.my main belief is life and existence cannot exist without time, to go back or travel forward in time is to control life. so if someone where to be able to do such a thing they in essence become a sort of god over existence themselves. each choice you make brings fourth a different future, but at the same time exists a future that exists with the choices you didnt make. so the tesseract holds all possibilities, anything can be created from it and destroyed. so how does one control it? through the mind, it is controlled by dreams, why dreams? because our 3 demensional minds cant comprehend higher demensions like this so they come up with there own intepretation of it, through this anyone who ends up in the tesseract if well traiend enough in the mind can control it through thought.so the tesseract is in enssence the darkness of time and the beyond of the demensional distortions, its time itself.hope that explains it for you.

the magic arm is actualy a vortex creature. basicaly if you get all the bubbles it spews out or as many as you can and return back to the glyph that says "find the magic arm" it will then say "you now know the hunters song" which you use in the 3d levels to kill enemies with.

It's because I dunno if an evolved creature like this is a Vortex minion or not. Anyway, I need to play again ToT to see where are those creatures. The first is in the Gateway, in the present, a passively one. By the moment there are no evolved Vortex drones near, but the Sea of Darkness if filled with space ones. In Secret Cave (if I'm right) there are another Magic Arm, a passive one again. Black Clouds owns a Mutated Magic Arm, of course attacks like an another Vortex minion. GravitorBox owns another annoying mutated one, like another guardian of something.In Atlantis is where there are some extrange issues. There are a kind of Magic Arms attatched to columns wich attack to Ecco, some silver crabs and an army of normal Magic Arms who attacks ferociusly.My theory is this the Magic Arms owns a power wich only the dolphins can hold (teh Hunter Song  idearoll:

Before posting my vortex theory i want to say something which seems to be off-topic. This is mainly for Solly, Arkon and those, who read the stuff i posted in my "Life origin" thread at COH. You know, accidentally - this is the only word which can describe what happened - i became an owner of the book i was talking about - D. Melchizedek "The ancient secret of the Flower of Life". The first thing is that the information given by me originally is not exactly correct, but is a simple, very short and  not fortunate at all retelling of some chapters. Secondly, i was surprised to read much familiar stuff there - the same which was posted about Atlantis by Arkon after my first post. I guess, Arkon, that you followed the road of D. Melchizedek and achieved familiar results. Or have you read this book? (But as far as i understood you didn't). And, finally, after reading several chapters it seemed to me that Ed read this book before creating "Ecco". But it couldn't be, because it appeared  much later. It is based on the seminar, which took place in october 1993, but the book itself was published in several years. The phrase which caught my attention was "When the Earth passes through certain periods of history, other space civilizations try to take control upon the planet". Drunvalo doesn't give them any name, but calls them "the Grey ones". They were on the Earth when Atlantis sunk, and the last time when they were here is 1989. But there always was a person who was impowered to defend the planet from them - the only one who could do it. And he - or she - always managed his/her task. Sounds familiar, yes? This is just for yr information. If you have a chance to read this book, please do - it is great beyond words. I'll stop here, but there's some more stuff i'd like to tell you. Ok, later. Now back to topic._________________________________________________________________________________ What was left behind the game. Ok, we concluded that the vortex are parasites. Agree? Now i am going to prove that this is not exact, and originally the vortex were not harmful at all and didn't terrorize the  universe, though they act like parasites now.The first thing which made me think like this is their society organization - as it was noticed, it looks like a hive. According to the ecological laws (i guess they're quite the same everywhere), the purpose of parasites' existance is endless multiplying. The fact that  they have a single female organism is a fact which doesn't allow to provide this purpose. Then, the organisation looking like a hive (where each organism does his own job) is a high level of organization, which is not available to parasites. The vortex have a high level of technology either, and no parasite can create such. So, out of this we can conclude that from the very beginning they were not parasites - and were not going to become ones. Then, to create space technologies the vortex needed time. So, they should have developed in their own world and feed upon it. Out of this comes the fact that they couldn't destroy all the life on their planet (if they were not helped to do it, of course) - there would be a factor which prevent this from happening. (The law of "the back connection" - i don't know if i translate it right, sorry - it means that if one species comes close to destruction of another one, the one it feeds, there will be "the back connection", which will destroy a great amount of the first species' organisms). So, it turns out that they didn't need  to travel to other planets. Something else should have happened. So, out of this complicated stuff i figure out the following story. (Of course, i don't want to say that THIS IS how it exactly happened, it's just a theory. Only a single person knows what happened in truth - it's Ed.)  So, the vortex were the dominating lifeform on their planet. They passed through their unique evolution and achieved great results. I suppose they were not like the creatures we know now. They had a higher level of consciosness that times, and higher technologies also (later i'll explain why i think so).  If to consider their "adoration" to abyssal depths, maybe their world had a high pressure and a low temperature. They could be space travellers that times - they had a good knowledge of space, at least, and could communicate with other species. If Asterite's home world is constellation Delphineus, it explains why he had good knowledge about them - as well as they knew him. They could have communicate long time ago. But suddenly something happened. It can be generally described as an energetic crisis.Different reasons could cause it - Asterite should know why it happened.  After that regress followed - they lost some of their technologies. Remember, they had to wait for 500 years to travel to Earth "when there is a clear path", but not when they need it. (Idea copyright by D. Melchizedek - the story of Nibiru). Trying to find out what to do the vortex decided to take the needed energy from the other worlds. (I think that there are some more planets they feed upon - 500 years is a long period, the amount of energy they take on the Earth is obviously not enough for them). They chose the ones which had either a low technology level, or had none at all, and also a lower level of consciousness - maybe not to get powerful resistance.  The Earth was included.Well, this is enough! I will tell you more, and i also have some comments to Raeckon's  theory, but this is not for now. A day is obviously not enough to write this! And if to consider this is not my theme to speak on... Ok, i hope i'll manage to finish my theory by tomorrow - at least i'll do my best. Thanx.

raekon we still cant speculate that when vortex and earth are in contact vortex is light years from earth, firstly, ecco didnt have to swim lightyears to vortex and back yet he was in "the vortex world" two possiblities come from this//www.crystalinks.com/nibirureturn.jpghttp://www.crystalinks.com/nibiru.htmlalso id like to clear up the crap about the vortex and the asterite "knowing each other" thats completly untrue, originaly the vortex and the asterite had no connection at all.the reason why the vortex learned of the asterite is because long ago the vortex were at war with atlantis and possibly learned of the atlanteans and there descoveries. it was the atlanteans that learned of the asterite first, and the vortex probably gained there knowlege of the asterite from the atlanteans along with the time machine and many other things, there is no proof from the game showing the asterite had previous contact with the vortex kind, we know the asterite and atlanteans know of each other but the vortex and asterite originaly had no connection. so its better to conclude the vortex learned of the asterite through the atlanteans.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
because in ecco one there was no magic arms, which means they were introduced when the vortex came to earth, sorry but your thoery about them being atlantean creations has no backing, otherwise the magic arms would of existed in ecco 1, and they dont. its better to conclude they are vortex creations, especialy since they exist in the dark future.

woohoo, thatks.Asti, its not in my gallery anymore but I did a pic "based" on the undercaves level, i made 3 seperate BMP files for it too.but trust me, i'm just as amazed as you its been ages sence I last used MS paint and with a mouse no less If i'm desprate I do it where there is no wacom or photoshop...actually the sadest thing was I almost tryed to let go of the mouse and grab the pen (habituated aren't I?) :D As I said, I'm really impressed and can't imagine something like that for me. After I saw these pictures, I tried to draw a little and the results were terrible. Is there any cool and little programm where I can draw a few things to practise? I mean, a very easy one for people with absoultely no skills? Lol

I like it. Now I know the look of the character behind your cool story. It's well done.

<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, that's good to know, Delphi. And Tethys, his personality is the main part of all my studies. Ever read my book preview? I think you can figure out much about him and especially in the second game, he really has an interesting personality and it's lovely to analyze it. Btw, about Ecco's personality I never found anything out. It's sad that he had no dialogues and we all don't know how he really would act. Some game infos described him but it's very vague and thus I never got a deeper connection to him which is strange to say. All in all you can say that only Asterite reveils some parts of himself in that game. The others are more or less neutral.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I have a problem with finding out which worms truly are magic arms. There are many kinds of worm-like enemies in Ecco 2 and in Ecco 1 we can't find any. Look at the worms in Lunar Bay or at the one in Asterite's future. I guess that there are only two true magic arms in the game and that's when the glyphs mention them and say that you have to find them.Anyway, I would agree about the fact that they are Vortex creatures or creations and there is no proof for them being Atlantean. If the game creators wanted to tell us that they were Atlantean, they would have given us some hints for that. But I still believe that the other worms that you call magic arms, are not more than a way to have a bigger diversity of enemies/characters in the game.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
also id like to clear up the crap about the vortex and the asterite "knowing each other" thats completly untrue, originaly the vortex and the asterite had no connection at all.the reason why the vortex learned of the asterite is because long ago the vortex were at war with atlantis and possibly learned of the atlanteans and there descoveries. it was the atlanteans that learned of the asterite first, and the vortex probably gained there knowlege of the asterite from the atlanteans along with the time machine and many other things, there is no proof from the game showing the asterite had previous contact with the vortex kind, we know the asterite and atlanteans know of each other but the vortex and asterite originaly had no connection. so its better to conclude the vortex learned of the asterite through the atlanteans.My first idea about them knowing each other has been proved wrong and there was no connection between Asterite and the Vortex. I corrected my theory about that but it's still unfinished. The true reason why people believe that is that most don't know the game gear version of the game. This version seems to be the ONLY game that proves a certain connection between Asterite and the Atlanteans because a glyph (created by the Atlanteans only) refers to Asterite and this doesn't happen in other games. We believe that Asterite studied Atlantis and that Atlantis studied Asterite but since Asterite was such a passive and hostile guy in the past who didn't care, we guess that they NEVER communicated. But they learned from each other and that's why the Vortex, who know the Atlanteans - their enemies -very well, also know about Asterite later. They also did not pay attention to each other because they had no reason for it. Asterite spent his calm life as a student on Earth and the Vortex never payed attention to him because they had no trouble with him. It's also important to mention that the Atlanteans knew about past, present and future. That's how they placed their glyphs and how they knew about Asterite, Ecco and so on...About the tube and the blackhole, I'm not sure. I also thought they'd have a spaceship to travel and the word 'Vortex World' I never took too seriously.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Superb Eao! Absolutly superb! I adore the second one as well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I guess the best that we can do there is kind of give Ecco a personality we would think him as. I noticed that he never talked as well. Oh well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Finally I read your post, Delphina, and it's very interesting. I agree about the issue that the Vortex are no parasites. I guess they are a very old and highly-developed race that exploited their planet in a destructable way until it became I world full of technology but lacking of natural ressources and a living environment. That's just my personal imagination of them and not a theory. They got knowledge about Earth when they followed the Atlanteans who probably fought them and whose planet was dead too. The Atlanteans hid here and built up a base to defend against them and that's why the Vortex started to feed on Earth. They need this 'clear path' stuff to come here and that's why they only visit every 500 years. The game also says that their harvests increase and the reason for that may be that each race grows in their technology, their teritory and also in their needs. I also think they visit other worlds too. In the game, they show one of these feeding attacks but it doesn't affect Earth in a serious way I guess. The ocean is not empty after that, they just take a few creatures with them and the only point Earth has to worry about is that their hunger grows. Later in Ecco 2 the problem is another one, it's revenge and Earth has a true reason to worry about that.My opinion is that the possibility to make an acceptable theory about the topic, exists, but there still needs something to be done. Your ideas are cool, Delphina, and Raeckon's ideas are good too but we should try to merge the stuff together and look at all the delivered facts from the game as carefully as possible. It doesn't make sense to spectaculate wildly as I sometimes did in my old Asterite-theory. My personal view about that is that I'm not really interested in the Vortex and that's why I know nothing about them. For me they just symbolize a typical alien invader race we can find in lots of games and I feel no relation to them. But if people discuss that in a way we can see here, it's very nice to read it even if I don't know how to contribute.Another question: The book you mentioned, is that a true scientific theory or rather a finctionous story? I don't believe in alien invasions and chosen ones, lol, but it sounds interesting to read.

<div id='container'>
That's a very stupid thread, I know, but another topic inspired me too much to ignore it. We don't know anything about the personality of Ecco the Dolphin, our great hero, and no-one here could give a true or false reply but what do you think who he really is?And I don't want a reply like: He's an animal. Animals want to survive and have no personality.I just want to hear your personal imagination of him if we would give him human traits. What kind of guy is he, how old is he and do you have a connection to him after playing the game etc.

I know is science fiction, but, simply I can't imagine a world aproaching to the Earth every 500 yearsyeah but the problem is earth and vortex come into contact every 500 years, the game supports this thoery. the atlanteans we know learned of the vortex before hand more likely through there forseeing of the future.the atlanteans according to ecco 2 handbook were lead by cassandra who was there sort of leader. she predicted atlantises end. according to greek mythology cassandra was a prophet who made a great prediction but no one listened to her. i know ed annunziatta considered this for the game, plus he has a daughter named cassandra in real life ;)your thoeries seem okay you know alot of stuff but i cant stress enough you need to play the game and research more before writing your thoery you cant relie on me to correct your thoery. you can roll your eyes at me all you want but i know this game better then anyone and when you analyze something your pulling up evidence from what we know.we know the vortex hive is located on vortex ecco indeed traveled to the vortex world, we know earth and vortex have a clear path every 500 years, and possibly come into close contact every 500 years, cause how would ecco have traveled from earth to vortex so easily. then again there could have been a blackhole between the tube of vortex and earth.anyways i relly think the idea of the space ship needs to be trashed, and we need to come up with a plausable way for vortex and earth to come into contact, if you can find a better way then my thoery about the two planets comeing near each other then do it, but seriously i dont see any other way besides a blackhole created from the vortex "sucktion"

Well, always I saw him like a "teenage dolphin"  :D He is curious, he have a lot of ambition (he never stops from missions), he is not wise but is learning a lot from his friends thanks of course to his intelligence and smartness. He also have a kind heart, and a lot of patience (seeking baby orcas sucks me a lot x_X ) He is not coward but very impressionable. He isn't afraid from heights (but after skylands... ) And lastly, he is very very moaning (he always complains when is near to a little pebble)Yez, also he is very charismatic and have a mysterious army of fans xD

It's a really neat design.  Good linework, too.

Where were the glyphs that mentioned magic arms?  I only remember encountering one.  And I never knew what it was talking about, except it seemed to refer to that wormlike Vortex creature, but I never figured out (until now) what I was supposed to do with it.  And it didn't seem to be crucial to completing the game.Why is it called a "magic arm" anyway?  I've never seen anything that looked less like an arm.And I would imagine that if something looks different, it probably is different.  Unless there's more similarity than just a wormlike body.  Then it could be another variety or something.I guess I just figured that anything that didn't look like something from this planet and wasn't in Atlantis was some variety of Vortex.  I just figured that some Vortex looked like worms.  I mean I can't imagine a planet that only has one species that all look the same.

Well with the way dialouge was done, it would be hard to distinguish who was speaking if Ecco did talk.  Game characters never spoke much, even if other characters in the game did the main one usually didn't.  Except in RPG's.  Of course when the Dreamast came out speech became more common for characters.  But at the time it wasn't something you saw much.So it was hard to get a good idea of any character's personality, especially in Ecco's case since you don't have any expressions to go by, either.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I've always seen Ecco, for some reason, as having a gentle type of personality.  He seems to be pretty popular with the other pod members, but I think that's at least partly because his unusual markings make him stand out.  But I think he's also friendly, and he likes to help others whenever he can.  I think in the manual somewhere it says he's a young dolphin, so I figured he's not quite an adult yet, or maybe a young adult.  I always figured he was kind and caring, and generally quiet.  He also has a lot of inner strength, and a strong connection to his family and friends.  And he has strong determination, never gives up.I think that he was probably a reluctant hero type.  He wasn't looking to be a hero, he just kinda got dragged into it without any choice.  His family was taken away and he had to find them.  Along the way other events occured, and some of the things he did caused more things to happen that he had to take care of.  He was the only one who could do all of this.  And he ended up being the only one with the power to stop the Vortex.  I think he was perfectly happy to remain home where he was in normal daily life, but was sucked into all this and had no choice but to go through it all.  Well...he had a choice but the only other option would be to do nothing and let the world come to an end.  But he wouldn't allow that to happen.So I think he's also brave, and has a good heart.That was longer than I planned.
</div>

<div id='container'>
You people have way too much time on your hands to spend so much of it just sitting there thinking about this stuff.  But it is interesting to see other peoples' theories.I theought the Tube connected from the Earth's ocean to the Machine on Vortex.When Ecco went back to the time that the storm came and took his pod away, he was also taken along with the storm this time.  I kinda just figured that Ecco was borne away on this storm, and was taken to the Tube that way.  But...was there something between there?  I can't really remember.  I guess that idea doesn't work very well anyway.  But then, I never put much thought into it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I see him as a young energetic creature who has great curiousity, but as time goes on he gains experience and wisdom. Someone who looks for fun, but is serious and strong when needed. When he knows something must be done, he goes with it until the end.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Really cool, Raeckon. Your story sounds interesting. I'll be looking forward to reading it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Nice! I like it....it sort of resembles a river dolphin in the shape and the long beak.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wont go into a LOT of detail about this demo...lets just say...its demo 3 with a little new stuff and lots of NEW instruments that make it sound more uuh clean? heheh yeahhttp)thats all..thanks in advance..BYE BYE!  :D
</div>

<div id='container'>
For me there are two ways how I can see him. He's introduced in a relyable way both in the Ecco Comics and in the game videos. We all know that the Comics don't really count because they are fan-made and not official but I like to look at them because they give the characters of the game more personality. So I cannot completely avoid to see Ecco like he is there. In the comics he is like a wild, stubborn teenager, he doesn't trust others (like Asterite), wants to attack any lifeform that looks like an enemy, is determined to save his family and always seems to be a bit uncontrolled, heatened and uncareful. Of course, he has a good core and is the typical fighter for the rights of weaker creatures but I think that has to learn much in his life. He seems young, angry and judgeful, I guess that he could become a great and wise leader but I also think that he has to learn about devotion, mercy and humility.The second way to look at him is shown in the original game videos of the Sega CD version. We know that these videos count as official because Ed probably worked out or controlled the contents and so we could say that they show a character of Ecco, that can be used for an official interpretation. Of course, the dolphin doesn't talk there, it would sound ridiculous if he would talk but he has some cute facial expressions that touched me very much (even Asterite shows a strange kind of his own original 'facial expressions' by using light and movement) and I think that was a nice way to give him a personality. We can see him smiling, he seems to be friendly, curious and caring but he also sometimes looks angry, aggressive and determined. That supports other views of him and I'd like to agree with that. In the videos he symbolizes a very nice guy which contradicts the comics but both views are interesteing to regard.
</div>

<div id='container'>
I really feel the same, Tethys. I never knew about that and it wasn't necessary to complete the game.The name 'magic arm' confused me alot because I didn't search for a creature when I heard that word. I searched for...well...an arm.I'm not sure, it was just me who thought that there were two glyphs that referred to magic arms. Maybe I'm wrong.There were so many diferent worms in the game. Not all were Vortex creatures and not all were magic arms. I'm confused about what it truly is.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You people have way too much time on your hands to spend so much of it just sitting there thinking about this stuff.Believe me, Ecco is the only game where I have that problem. I'm hopeless but I have my reasons. And secondly, that's why we still exist. It's fun. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Very well done. I could tell that you added more instruments and it gave a different feel to the song than the other demos.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ah another "gothic dolphon" (gothic means ornaite and decorated, as in a gothic cathredial)I din't understand your story much, it sounded almost like a cross between Man's and Dolphin's nightmare.but its good to see other species out there insted of monsterized bottlenosed.i guess he's in photoshop hiuh?want a tip, if you do a pen and ink like drawing and scann it (what ever way possible) open up your drawing in Photoshop and make a new layer at 25 or 55 opasity, and use for color...it'll "look like comic book coloring"
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What you got from the video sounds closer to how I imagined him.  I haven't seen that myself because I never had a Sega CD.  And I haven't seen those comics either.  But that also sounds like a good, and reasonable, interpretation.  All the versians stated here sound pretty good. Of course, like Soleila said, there's no right or wrong answer since no one really knows for sure.  Just as long as it makes sense.  It's interesting to see what other people think.
</div>

<div id='container'>
The videos and comics are really sweet and you can get them somewhere here I think. If you didn't see them, you missed something beautiful and esp. the videos totally rock and are very cute and well-designed.To make it easy, we could also say that Ecco acts like the player because it's the player who decides if he acts aggressively or carefully but Ecco was not an rpg and we had no big influence on his developement and situation. If it would be a today's game, it would be different I think.

Now there's an idea.  An Ecco RPG.  That's be pretty sweet, actually.  You could have Trellia, Kitnee, and Tara as characters.  Or maybe even new characters.It would also be unique as far as RPG's.  Something that takes place underwater.

Hahaha, that's hilarious! In German the word exists too and it definitely is a word to describe someone's obsessions in a funny way. An example could be my Asterite-spleen. It had to mean something like this, I promise. We also call it 'tick' or 'schacke', lol.

Let's see if I can get my comedic engine kicked into motion.First must pick some kickass music...(ocremixes........mm mm good)Now must pick some kickass...meh the music was enough.Well a few days ago my illustrious aunt comes to me and starts talking about the behedings and crap in places like Iraq. She asks if I know how to use the web. (i spend all day sitting in front of my computer, what, you think I'm trying to learn dos through trial and error?) so I reply in the sweetest possible voice, yeeeeees.then I get the ever so famous, OH.you know this oh?I bet you do.it's the OH you get when you say something sarcastic and the authority figure you're talking to is trying to unhinge your sarcasm (in vain).Well can you show me this site to see these pics?this is where the error begins.1. I said yes.2. I said yes to go onto a computer, and log into the information superhighway with a 70 some year old woman who forgot the procedure for shutting down computers (ten times) telling me what to do.3. I said yes ma'am.there should've been lights.there should've been sirens.but nooooooo, not a single subconscious warning about the pile of shit I just logged myself into.So after seven misreadings of the exact web address and three unintentional porn popups I grab the paper and type in the address myself. It was the addy to some stupid california AM radio thing like knx 1070 or something really catchy like that, the kind of name they put in the annoying jingles that get stuck in your head driving down the coast highway in rush hour traffic while your dad's griping at life trying to see if there was a damned accident.So then she directs me to several links which she thinks are it. two were more porn popups and one of the annoying ones about how to stop popups...then we found the official speedvision homepage, you know that cool channel on the mose expensive cable packages that has only racing all day so you don't have to have commercials about golf during the indy500? yeah that one.So I get back to the site and find the link myself and boom there it is. exactly what it was looking for.I don't think it had occured to me exactly what she was looking for until that very moment. She wanted to be like the lanky kid from secondhand lions and the sixth sense, she wanted to see dead people.Several things crossed my mind like, my how little blood you have in your neck sir, my what a very sharp knife, and spekkio (but I think about spekkio just about every half minute anyway so there was no real change on that last one, the psychologist in my head is beginning to think that spekkio is the mental manifestation of my lack of a girl, but you know how right psychologists are). Then I thought the more important thought of that day, oh how wonderful bill gates is in the planning of his windows gui to copy mac and use that lovely x in the corner instead of making people use the file menu or press alt+f4.There went that window. So then she's like, why's it gone, i didn't get a good look.ANd now for that day's fun quote: "If you wanna get a good look at a man without a head watch sleepy hollow, but I'm not going back to that site in my life so you'd better wait for mom to get home."Back to the story, the day drove on and i quickly browsed my (censored) library to get my mind off my churning stomach. Fortunately some human instincts have great tendencies to block out all other thought processes for a while, (natural drugs, great, now if only druggies knew) then I played Chrono Trigger on my emulator and made it so that Crono had over the dinky 3 digits in health and lavos had 999,999 hp, mmmm rom hacks...*drools*ANyway, that's my first satire on life, please post('th) comments('th) and tell me if I should Post('th) more!

Hey hey hey, random ist not touched by the iceberg of your fingers tipped by you people. To be real random...you have to be flipped upside down in jelly and extricated of your family jewels while in a 69 position with your favorite brand of hot dogs and a small olive loaf with a quarter inch drill bit inside. But not even I can go there, my programming ferments it.To get a hint of the perfection that worships the random god (she's got a nice booty, not like j-lo though, not as big, it's more like Schala's, yknow from chrono trigger? yeah the only one with bigger 80's hair than ayla.) you must bathe in pepto bismol every fortnight and walk about your house carrying incense and lard and a lighter with a sign that says I intend to light it, I really do. And then you must bathe in cooked and frozen lard, but not the very same lard you carried around unintentionally lighting.And when you emerge from the world of unhappiness and discrepancies you can form a religion on it, and call it the religion of Anubis, because everyone knows Anubis has nothing to do with any of the precepts of the religion, but we just like copying the uneducated biters who like taking names of ancient gods and forming paganistic cults after them which are really just individualized versions of the same thing, speaking of which, I wonder when AOL is going to come out with their next increment of free hours for the underclass of seniors, children under 12 and middle class yuppies to cheat them out of millions of dollars with?*kicks random generator up a notch*Purple stick flapjaw in the peanut sauce, I need scissors, 61.aww now it's just giving me stupid mgs2 colonel quotes.Raiden, you're playing too close to the tv....this blowsRaiden, turn the game console off now.As you wish, master.

Well here I'll put my ickle thing in, try not to mutilate me too badly for my theory as it may be disproven by Arkon in five nanoseconds.I believe that the game designers had in mind that the Asterite IS DNA, meaning he is the origin of every one of the four proteins that make up life. I get a large part of this theory from a movie I saw in BIO last year. In the movie it described how theories suggest that the amino acid chain existed in earths infantessimal oceans, created by the heat produced from undwerwater volcanic vents, and these amino acids began to rise, and disperse, until they reached the tide pools. There are many bubbles in the tide pools, and as strange as it sounds, they think that these bubbles may have been the origins of todays cell membranes. If this is the case then it can be said that the asterite CAN reproduce, in fact it HAS reproduced, that is where life came from. I don't however believe that it 'controls' evolution, evolution isn't mutation, it's not organisms changing. It's changes through generations. A common misconception is to view evolution as a bunch of changes that determine whether one species lives or dies. That's far too general, evolution is natural selection, evolution is survival of the fittest, a species doesn't change. What I mean is people think that evolution involves life NEEDING legs, so over generations life forms legs, and boom, that evolutionary tract stops. In fact its more complex than that, an andrewsarchus (the origin of most oceanic mammals) didn't just grow fins and plop into the water. First it started swimming, then a few got picked off by our prehistoric ocean predators, then only the andrewsarchuses...(don't know plural of it) with flatter paws would outrun predators. thus the babies with thin paws died. This process continued, and similar processes caused it to lose its fur, elongate its nose, etc. until we have a whale. That's why I don't think the asterite could control evolution, because evolution isn't something that's controllable, it's not a process, it's a complex system with several controlling factors, none of which are mysteries, and all of those factors are known and explained.Thus I think the asterite is simply, DNA, he may have come from another planet, he may have come from volcanic vents, either way the basis of my theory is sound...I think. If this doesnt make sense tell me so I can go more in depth, I tend to be choppy with my theories.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Noone here said that Asterite controls evolution. I just believed that but I've been proved wrong and came to the conclusion that he came here to study life with no interference. We all know how the process of evolution works and I don't believe that Asterite owns it. I just thought that he probably helped lifeforms to evolve but this happens years later in the far away bright future when he cares for Earth. In the past he remained silently and did not manipulate life.I don't think that Asterite IS DNA. He is much more complex or did your DNA-strands ever talk to you, manipulate time, change you into other lifeforms or save the planet by giving you powers to defeat an alien race? Asterite is a living animal, makes decisions, feels, developes himself and decides to protect after experiences changed his mind. He came from outer space, was born on a planet or somewhere deep in universe and it was his task to study life and to gather information. He hid himself for years and when he had no other chance he started to care. It sounds pretty strange that a DNA-strand acts in such a way and I would rather like to say that his shape is a symbol the game creators used to show something. Regarding DNA and looking at the way it comes to be, the resemblance between Asterite and it becomes more and more unlikely. It's easier for any kind of interpretation to assume that the design is just a symbol, an easy way to show something that even children could recognise while playing the game. And one further disproof: If he can reproduce himself as you said, why didn't he succeed in reproducing one missing globe? He needed the original globe back and wasn't able to create a new one in years. His complex and intelligent lifeform shows that he cannot BE DNA. If DNA is the basic of life, Asterite must have own DNA to develope himself. He learns in his life and evolves. Later he is able to create metaspheres and to receive a stronger and maybe more resistable body (his future design) so how could a DNA achieve anything like that?

I'm not sure, probably a year or so, maybe a little less.

Well no my DNA never talked, but I've never seen a DNA strand the size of the asterite. Maybe the logic was similar to what most people believe about the human brain, how if we used more of it we would be able to do paranormal things like telepathy. As for your reproduction, have you ever seen a man who lost an arm grow a new one back by having sex with someone elses arm? Reproduction isn't the same as regeneration, if creating a new globe counted as reproduction then you would be saying what you said you DIDNT believe earlier about how he was made up of many creatures.Also you say he manipulates evolution in the future, I just got done proving that evolution cannot be manipulated, what he did was mutate the code, which is different than evolution, a human being could incite a gene mutation, nothing controls evolution. You say he is a symbol, but what is he a symbol of? If it's life, then calling him DNA wouldn't be too off.

Reproduction isn't the same as regeneration, if creating a new globe counted as reproduction then you would be saying what you said you DIDNT believe earlier about how he was made up of many creatures.*snicker*  That's a good one.  And I agree with that point.  However, I don't beleive that the Asterite is actually a giant DNA strand.  For one thing, he/it would be incomplete if that were the case.  It doesn't have the "rungs" that DNA strands have, the fibers or whatever they are that connect the proteins (I can't remember the technical term, it's more than five years since I had a biology class).  And a single protein cannot be as big as the Asterite's globes are.  Something of that size would have to be made up of many cells.  I just can't imagine an actual DNA strand being that big.  If I could just remember more, it would be easier for me to prove my point.  I can't remember if a protein is a molecule, or if the actual strand is considered a molecule (which I don't think it is cuz it's too complex), but in any case you just don't see molecules of that size.  It just doesn't work that way.  If only I had my biology book to back me up so I could look this up to make sure.  Anyway, I just don't think such a thing is possible.  Besides that, the Asterite apparantly changed over time, since he is different in the bright future.  DNA doesn't do that.  Sometimes it's mutated, but that's something that happens when it's formed.  It doesn't change over time.Oh, the other thing I wanted to say is your brain analogy doesn't work.  It's true humans supposedly only use 10% of our brains, and who knows what we'd be capable of if we used more.  But DNA isn't like that.  A DNA strand does not just use 10% of itself.  The whole strand is used.  Everything on it is put into use.  So it's not the same.of the beleif that it is either both sexes or neither one.

Due to inherent stupid factors in my logic I recede my argument (minus the reproduction part) because I have made an ass of myself and this is the closest thing to a fix there is. Tethys is right, IM the one who needs to brush up on bio, the asterite lacks the hydrogen bonds that DNA has. Still an interesting point I noticed that I brought up, is it possible that the asterite is in fact the origin of life? (And due to stupidities in my logic which I noticed five seconds after I posted I must add): In the mythos of Ecco.

To reply to your question, a DNA is a symbol for the basics of life and that's true. It's the basic component of each lifeform and contains all the information about it. Asterite shows a symbol because his design is simple but perfected. The higest level of developement is shown in the origin, he may be as old as universe and it's hard to believe that one huge and highliest-developed DNA could be born at the beginning. Tethys is right, it doesn't work like that and if he really would be DNA he would exactly look like that//members.lycos.nl/TheDNApage/dnanim/dnanim02.gifThat doesn't remind me to Asterite and so I'll stay with my symbol-theory. It's just not completed yet. Another point could be that his design just had to show and everylasting harmony and a true kind of balance and eternity. That's what I also feel when I look at him. It's completeness and perfection I think but it also looks simple and original.

Your idea had good reasoning, it just doesn't fit in with the facts. Wasn't there already some discussion about whether or not the Asterite is the source of life?  I think it was stated that he could have inadvertantly brought life to Earth, but it wasn't on purpose.  I also think it's possible the Asterite's race may be the oldest in the universe, which would kinda make sense for the life thing because it means that race serves as kind of a prototype so to speak for other races.Just as a note, I only say "he" out of habit and cuz it's less confusing.  But I beleive the Asterite to be a genderless being, just because it doesn't look like it could be either way.

Heh, did I catch ya with that title?

Yeah, we concluded about that. He possibly brought life to Earth accidentally by taking bacteria with him but he didn't come here to create it. I said that in my first post and did not expect people to like this idea but it sounds more and more pbvious to me. The name proves that he came from universe and I also support the theory that he was sent here to study Earth and that he is an individual of a race which comes to be in space and which travels to several planets to learn and to stay there forever. I know this thread means a lot of reading stuff but it's cool that people reacted on it so much.Thyme41, I did not want to mess with you. I like your ideas and I hope that you won't be angry because I always feel responsible to join when people talk about my obsession.  Anyway, for me Asterite must be male. It's a habit from the book I'm writing. I did not post anything about it in this forum because I'm lacking of interest but that's the reason why I call him a 'he'. Take it as artistic license. The book wouldn't work otherwise

I agree, Moonfin. Good posters are hard to find and averagely there is only 1 of 10 persons who takes posting seriously and who stays. That's why I am a member of two boards only. Of course, there are more places I like but I also know that interest will leave me one day and that I wouldn't be able to stay there for longer. With Ecco everything is different and so I'll stay as long as these places exist or even as long as I live (if you can stand that). Lol.

I'd better answer yr replies. To Arkon thanx for calling my ideas cool  i will leave yr vortex theory for now (but i still have what to say about it). Sorry for that. May i ask you) Because you simply don't believe that there can be "travelling" planets?  Umm, it turned out to be less than what i had to say. Ok, maybe i'll add something later.

I had three shots of tequillia, had a few cigarrettes, went out with my ex girlfriend and her friend and we went to see the fireworks but it was too cloudy, luckily alot of people on the streets lit off what they had so we got to see some fireworks and even see some m-1000's explode. I even got to lite off a bottle rocket in front of a crowd so it wasnted a waste.I also went out to eat after that then took a cab ride home so i had fun. As soon as i go to my moms house like i put in the update, i'll be able to lite off my whole collection of fireworks i been saving.I got bottble rockets, fire crackers, moon whistlers, roman candles, roman candle m-80's, i have the works. I just wish i had batteries then id have the ultimate.

I've always seen Ecco, for some reason, as having a gentle type of personality.  He seems to be pretty popular with the other pod members, but I think that's at least partly because his unusual markings make him stand out.  But I think he's also friendly, and he likes to help others whenever he can.  I think in the manual somewhere it says he's a young dolphin, so I figured he's not quite an adult yet, or maybe a young adult.  I always figured he was kind and caring, and generally quiet.  He also has a lot of inner strength, and a strong connection to his family and friends.  And he has strong determination, never gives up.I think that he was probably a reluctant hero type.  He wasn't looking to be a hero, he just kinda got dragged into it without any choice.  His family was taken away and he had to find them.  Along the way other events occured, and some of the things he did caused more things to happen that he had to take care of.  He was the only one who could do all of this.  And he ended up being the only one with the power to stop the Vortex.  I think he was perfectly happy to remain home where he was in normal daily life, but was sucked into all this and had no choice but to go through it all.  Well...he had a choice but the only other option would be to do nothing and let the world come to an end.  But he wouldn't allow that to happen.So I think he's also brave, and has a good heart.That was longer than I planned.Yup, Id have to agree with Tethy on this one, Ecco is your classic "hero' undiluted, un-adjusted, like a hero realy should be, modest, noble, self sacrificing, hes what many humans could really learn from.

Asterito (in spanish xD)*melts* How cute!Yeah, I agree. Anything else doesn't make sense and Ecco had to morph into a drone to go further. I think the metasphere has been placed there temporarily and the drones didn't notice it because they absolutely don't know anything about metaspheres and about Asterite's ability to create them. Maybe he uses the tesseract to send them where ever he wants.Weeeeeeel maybe im off the ball here  But who says the Vortex didnt realize what the spheres are capable of and used them as well? Who knows if just another tigershark, or whatever you run into isnt REALLY a morphed vortex drone :3

That is very cute, and pretty good for a beginner in art. I especially like those swirls; it's impressive how you can get so creative with dolphins and whales   good job.Thanks! Yeah but orcas are dolphins heh I know that.   I didn't realize it was an orca though so I wasn't sure.Good luck with that Portugues, Arkon. I have trouble learning new languages since I'm such an old hag (you know the saying where the older you are the harder it is for you to remember ^.^). I had to paste stickies with french words on every object around my house when I took French.  :? But then again, maybe that's just me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
how old are you?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
16. Considered young for some but old for me. I struggle with languages. The best way to learn is to go live in a country that speaks that language as a main.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
bleh that isnt old, your hella young, 21 now thats old.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
actually that started out as a doodle, and I decided 'hey, that looks cool, maybe I should finish it'...like I said, it was because of the insomnia....this drawing is far beyond my normal style. O_o maybe your brain just fries when you're up all night.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Whatfor?I can't imagine a reason for the Vortex to morph into their food creatures. This would cause lotsa confusion. I think they did not notice the metaspheres. As we said, they think like insects and so they won't mind that. And it is told in the game (by a glyph) that Asterite made the metaspheres and not that the Vortex made them. So I guessed that they were put/sent there by Asterite to help Ecco as he does the same in several other levels too.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
x.x Scared or life, ill never look at him the same way again.....without busting  a gut XDHaha, it was truly my aim to let the Ecco community think of him in a different way and to see him when they look at me. Even my mother gives me the nickname Asti from time to time. XD
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Bah, could it be that I'm the Arkonviox.com-Grandma here with my soon 24?!?! It was good when Brian Teccnowhatever was around but now...

I spent the weekend with some really good friends from another state and spent time going to many sites in what you could call my home town. I had fun, and of course the fireworks show was a blast. I always look forward to that. Even though it is late, I hope everyone else had a good fourth, regardless of what you did.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Fabulous. It looks incredible now, let alone with color! :o

<div id='container'>
I didn't have a very fun 4rth, but it was only because I made it so. I consider myself lucky to even set foot outside my house let alone go somewhere on a holiday. The last time I saw a firework show was when I was like 5....and we almost got arrested, but I won't go into details about that. ^_^; So I stayed home and played Ecco for 5+ hours as the kids outside are blowing themselves up with fireworks. But hey, I'm happy.  :) Happy late 4rth everyone!

Perhaps to try getting to Ecco perhaps to infeltrate somewhere, why should this be such an alien concept? They could  identify them by cent of frequential vibration to avoid confusion, much like an ant or bee would. And I didnt say THEY made the speres, just that they might have decided them usefull.

<br />

Kindof makes you wonder what it would look like in a movie with the propper CGI backing.

Okay okay, I insist on my old view but maybe you are right and they used them. It's only that I misunderstood you and believed that you said that they made them. Silly me.

To Solly: I'd like to chat with you, but I can't use my messengers.Few weeks ago I was able to use java chats, so talked with FargalEX in DarkSeas Chatroom. That was cool...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
To SollyO &lt;Jade&gt; He's the best &lt;FargalEX&gt; There was me thinking that Patrick Moore was the masterIf you want to chat properly in darkseas you'll be needing to use mIRC or Trillian. The java thing doesn't give you the freedom you deserve.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Okay... and you posted it here. Weeeheee.......  :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, it's kinda long but most are offline everyday.I have seen you on many times Asti. In fact, I caught you once when you signed in, but unfortunately it immediatly turned to "Away," so I didn't bother typing for I had to leave anyway in five minutes. I didn't realize that was you until a short while ago...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I posted this on COH but I thought that I should share it here too. Here are my Asterite-fanworks, a huge poster I made and a 3D-model of it. I'm also going to post the descriptions. Have fun with reading and looking at it.http//www.eccothedolphin.de/gallery/displayimage.php?album=4&amp;pos=1http I wanted to show you my stuff much earlier but I hadnt have a good digicam. Yesterday I finally bought one. Now I hope that you have an idea about what it means to be an obsessed fan. Lol.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sorry sorry sorry. One day I will find the time to chat with all of you. Yesterday Trellius contacted me but my new digicam caused some computer madness and I had to finish installation. All I need is time. I use Trillian and I'm in every messenger. Mostly I'm away but the weekends I'm around much. Java never worked for me and so I never saw a thing in the board rooms. Sorry, I will do my best to talk to you one day.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 Its not like your on a scedual to speak to everyone all the time, just get to it as time allows. Im a Trillian user myself, and actually could use soem advice. About 3 days ago it just plum refused to log onto Y! anymore, saying my details are wrong, ive double checked everything AND logged in with the same details on the homepage, whats wrong with Trillian? :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Dang, you definately earn the title of "Severely obsessed"   Seriously though, informative and well done.  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Woah, reighn it is Fargal, nothing aimed at you. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I had exactly the same problem with Y! Simply download the update of Trillian and everything will work well again. It just has a newer version now.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
That's awesome work, Solly.  :)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Awsome! You are realy a big fan of the Asterite! Lookies I am going to write an article about the Asterite can you help me? Here or msn which ever you prefer. :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Geh?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yahoo decided to change something so that Trillian users wouldn't be able to log in. Apparently.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Sure, I can. Have you read my theory thread? And there will be a new one I worked out with Arkon which will come out soon.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Get Trillian Pro 2.013. That's the update and everything will work again. 
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Cool thanks i will read it!

bill cosby is insane, he is so insane that he even scares the black community, and nothing scares them. I like bill cosby though i grew up watching his show o.oin a way i spend the 80's with my two dads, bill cosby and mr rogers, and i had a snufflufucus and a big bird that liked to sleep in the same room together (probably cause they were gay)as for bert and ernie i dont think there gay i always thought they were brothers.O.O I won't even ask arkon.....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Heh, nice. Definatly a lot of work put into that, but it all turned out very nice.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Know the funny part? I have that and still nada. :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Scary thing is I can relate to Arkon on most of those, though I STILL think Bert and Erny are gay, they just have to be. :?  As for my claim to fame? hmm..... A horse kicked me once.....it hurt... &gt;.&gt;;

It sounds like it's going to become a really good. I like the piano and the melody part.  (not sure what you used.)

What ever you feel you have to thank me for, I'm grateful and looking foward to what you mean.Wow, I remember that level too. It certainly took a great deal of my patience. Oh yeah, putting the little globes of the 3D-model together and sticking 45 paper sheets together was as hard as rebuilding the true Asterite in the game but somehow it was a funny feeling of bringing something wonderful to life. 8)

Amazing picture. Shame I don't know who you are.

Whoever you are, this picture is wonderful. It's something someone can't get out of the head and the design you chose for the creature is impressive.

I recall Arkon saying a long time ago that he or somone else was recording Ecco DotF music from the game, how do you record music from the PS2 and the disk that is inside?sorry for the incohearnce and short post, but this is intersting to me.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I guess the forums needs something really stupid to discuss, so I'll start this VERY random thread. What's something the opposite gender does that you find really annoying? Something I find annoying about guys - they find drawing dicks funny. I truely don't get that. Their obsession with body parts, sometimes even their own. I don't think I need to expand on that.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I hate how females are so emotional, and how when you get into a relationship with them they loose interest so easily, seems like they cant be satisfied with anything.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i have the intire music collection from defender of the future for dreamcast which is actualy better quality then the ps2 version, the way you get it is you have to rip it with special software and special hardware as well.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Same here Arkon. I got mine from Caverns of Hope and I even put them on CDs (such a freak I am). But there are some songs that are impossible to find on the net so you have to rip them directly from the games. My brother does it the hard way; he hooks the computer up to the tv. c.c
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh yes that....I know some females that think a relationship with a guy is just something for amusement, and that's how they see their boyfriend. That bothers me on so many levels it's not even funny.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
thats why every ex girlfriend of mine when they break up with me has a portion of there brain removed as a safty precaution courtesy of me.rule to know when you go out with me: dont fuck with me in the wrong way or i will hurt you. mw aha ha ha
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
;P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
What the? your actualy alive? whoa o_o;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I was thinking of doing it with the some final fantasy games...because my internet connection is so slow downloading takes too long.  I figure do it the fast way.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Actually, I've found I am more annoyed by my own gender than the opposite. So many girls I know are rude, prickish, snobby, and think they're better than everyone. Obsessed with fashion and makeup and the like. Preps. *shudders*Though some guys (mostly the jocks and football players, etc) think they're something incredibly special. Like, 'Oh, look at me, I can throw a ball across a feild and tackle people, I'm a football player, woohoo, praise me, bow before me...' Trust me, I know plenty of guys like that. Or when guys think they can push girls around. You know, guys who think the male gender is the ultimate, higher species.....*sigh*
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
NICE!!!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
awe your just a tom boy mutaclone, i think you were ment to be a guy but were made into a girl.  :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Mutaclone, I heard they put the importance of women before men in France. I always liked the French.   :)  Same gender? PMS.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Thanks everyone! People like you is what keeps me going. I benefited from this too, since I sold the sketch of this at my school for a guy who bought it for 25 cents(woohoo). I used it to buy a drink afterwards.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Guys that insist on telling everyone about their sexcapades. Stop bragging. Let your friends find out for themselves.and this isn't specifically about a certain gender...this goes for guys and girls. I get really annoyed how people these days are so casual with relationships and sex. Like it's just not a big deal. It's so depressing hearing friends of mine talk about their boyfriends/girlfriends like they are these little playthings that they just screw when they're horny. And I hear about these like...11 year old kids that are having sexual relations with each other? They're still babies! They've barely hit puberty.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Guys were never honest with me. They thought they could tell me what I wanted to hear to have sex with me but I can see through all of them and the crap they told me which drives me mad. Seeing through things can make you mad, that's real, and they totally underestimate women. I think the true problem between genders is that first they can't live with each other because they think in such a terribly different way and second they underestimate each other. Women usually think guys have no deeper feelings and guys usually think women are easily to manitpulate but both are just playing a game noone can win. When do you guys stop thinking of controlling us and our minds and when will you notice that we can see through your lies and play when we want? Oh yeah, and when will we women finally notice that we can't hurt you over and over with no consequences?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
And I hear about these like...11 year old kids that are having sexual relations with each other? They're still babies! They've barely hit puberty.You know what? This makes me freaking out. I hate it when these babys talk about their so-called experiences and pretend to be cool only because they wasted their innocence. It's stupid but I gave up to talk to these children. They won't even listed and it's a waste of time. They believe that they got it but basically they are the poorest when they believe they can do everything aged 11 or younger. Btw, where are you from? I thought it's only like that in Germany or Western Europe.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Boys don't like me. That's annoying. They hate me....   :x

There was this women between the ages of 25-30 that lived around in my area that got jailed several times because she had sexual relationships with a 13 year old boy. The boy even became a father after the 3rd or so incident.

Oh yeah, putting the little globes of the 3D-model together and sticking 45 paper sheets together was as hard as rebuilding the true Asterite in the game but somehow it was a funny feeling of bringing something wonderful to life. 8)I would imagine! And I also think that re-creating the model to reality has a much more satisfactory response in the final outcome!

Gosh, I don't really know. I always thought what'd he be like, but it's hard to place it on a creature who's 'voice' I have not heard aside from a sonar calling and the nails-on-chalkboard screech that plays when Ecco is killed. XDSo, maybe, hmm.. calm but involved, light-hearted, gentle, 'dolphin next store'-esque?

Yes, the sex thing does piss me off. So many people, guys and girls alike, act like sex is the be all and end all of a relationship. Like, if you're not having sex with the person you're dating, then you must not really love them or care about them. *eyeroll* That's why I'm going to avoid relationships for awhile now. At least with guys who think along those lines. And Arkon, you're probably right.....I am a pretty big tomboy. O_o

ditto.i hate being a girl, there is so much to "live up to", anatomicly and "mentaly"everyone is a prick, a sex crazed arrogent prick.I do have to agree though that everyone nowadays takes realtionships and sex too causal, then they yell at me when I look at them "wrong" for "oohing and awing and giggling" at other people (girls mostly) when two seconds ago they were pleging love and loyalty to their man.me? no one is attracted and when i'm a fool and like somone it a disaster because I spend to much energy on them.and don't tell me "i'm young you'll meet somone" especaly if you are 12.

bill cosby is insane, he is so insane that he even scares the black community, and nothing scares them. I like bill cosby though i grew up watching his show o.o He's not scary or insane, he just tells it like it is.  If he is that scary, then he might as well be the walking version of The Color Purple.  Criticism and the truth can be so hard to take sometimes.

Well, I don't think I have met a lot of what-you-could-call "famous" people. I did shake hands with a future Chicago Bears player, (Oh wow. The Bears.) and Miss Illinois. Let's see...anyone else? I met a professional music director and had a pic with him. Not much else except with local famous people that no one here would know. I guess when it comes to meeting celebrities my life is down right dull.

Jade, you can expect a long suffering time I also had between 12 and 18 but I can promise that this will end one day. The only good thing about being a 24-old woman is that all people give you respect, guys start a relationship with talking about marriage and you can play the wise one. Everything is easier and playing is over but it's also terrible to look behind and to see the kids who have no idea of life. Society is getting worse but I know for you that you will also laugh at your current situation one day.*mothering*

And I also think that re-creating the model to reality has a much more satisfactory response in the final outcome!Well, rebuilding him felt good both in the game and in reality but you are right that the real model gave me a feeling of being more useful. The best thing about it was that I finally had a true imagination of the look of Asterite in real when he's alive in 3 dimensions. How cool would it be to stand in front of a huge rotating double-helix in an underwater cave? WOW! :P

I am back.And it was cold most of the week, but really nice both weekends.Not as many fireworks as usual, but there was a forecast for rain on the 4th.  So I think people just didn't get as much cuz they weren't sure whether they'd be able to set them off.  Actually all the fireworks were on the third, there were only a few scattered ones on the fourth.

I guess I always assumed Bert and Ernie were brothers, also.  It's a kid's show for god's sakes.  People are so stupid.But then again, there's also Tinky Winky....Ummmmm....My dad knows Micheal the Archangel.  Seriously, there's this guy who really thinks he's Michael the Archangel.  My dad knew him in high school, and apparantly he's had several "identities", but finally settled on Micheal.  Went crazy in Vietnam or something.  My dad has some of his "heavenly currency" that he makes, and even a deed to a plot in Heaven. x.o;  This guy even gave my dad a certificate making him a general in the "army of Heaven".  Scary, huh?

I didn't realize there was anyone that old here.What I hate is when girls complain about being fat when they're actually so thin they look like you could snap them in half like a twig.  What, is that anorexia or something?  I mean I know girls often have poor body images because of what's expected and what's in the media, but I can't understand how someone who's too skinny to be allowed can look in a mirror and think they look fat.  And then there are those guys that still think women belong in the home and shouldn't work.  You'd think that frame of mind would have gone out by now. I can't think of anything else that hasn't already been said.  Though I could make a lot of complaints about the human race in general...

You're 24??  No kidding.  I didn't realize there was anyone that old here.Uhmm....yes, I'm not kidding. Why should I?And btw, you exactly stressed a point I hate too. It's the media's fault that even 5 year old have no other worries in life but feeling fat. The point about it is that girls only say how FAT they are because they want others to disagree in front of them and to calm them down in their stupid worries. I often knew people who stood next to me and said 'I'm fat.' 'Noone likes me.' or 'I'm ugly.' They just wanted me to disagree and when I said 'You're right.' they started to freak out but after all they changed and thought about how silly it is to tell others things they don't truly believe in. The best do to about it is ignoring them. This truly helps the mankind.

Jade, it'll pass. I'm sure everyone doesn't hate you that much. Just you wait ...Anyway, I guess I'm a little too young to know alot about guys right now, being only 14. But most guys my age expect too much from a girl. They expect the "perfect" body, "perfect" hair, perfect whatever. If you don't match their expectations, they don't even glance at you. As I'm getting older, I'm beginning to get noticed alot more often. I've had 20 year old men hit on me ... they thought I was some 17 year old girl.   I hate that. And they are so sexually orientated. Its like thats all they ever think about. They aren't in on a relationship unless there is at least "some" sex. Ugh. And like everyone else has said, they are show offs! They always brag about how big their penis is, like its supposed to get a girl's attention. Yeah right.  
</div>

It's so weird when they expect always too much.  :? I have a big nose. I know that. Everyone knows.I've heard that so many times from my friends.That hurts....Maybe that's the reason why I don't even want to make friends with new peolpe.I don't want to hear it again.

I have this tendancy to just assume certain things like that.  Like when I was surprised to find out there were older Sonic fans. e.e  Yeah I know that's pretty dumb, I shouldn't be surprised about stuff like that.What MoonFin said about someone thinking she was 17 reminded me of how when I was a Senior some Sophomore girls asked me what grade I was in and said they thought I was a Freshman. o_O;  I'm three years older than them and thye thought I was younger.  Not really sure what to think about that.

you know what i love about you tethys your so opininated and nitpicky, but when someone turns it on you you get relly sad about it but believe it or not i actualy like that your like that, sometimes it makes posts interesting im talking about the nitpickyness not the sad part. so yeah/

I watched the Teletubbies only one time. It happened accidentally a day before my final oral exam last year. Don't laugh, this seriously happened and it did no harm to me. Anyway, the Tubbies are pretty scary, make children dumb and so I think that's why they canceled the programm here in Germany. Some parents went mad on them and said that this 'repetition aspect' where the Tubbies say one phrase for 5 times would cause damage in children's development. I think they are right.

Hiya, Demon here.Well, for a start it would be challenging but, um, not so hard. On Ecco: DOTF I keep getting eaten by the GWS, get lost in the tunnels and run out of air or bet eaten by pirahnas (have I spelt that right?) in Perils Of The Coral Reef, and no, I do not mean The Return, I mean the SECOND LEVEL!!!!!!!!!Anyway, where was I? Oh, yeah - there should also be more playable characters (so it would be a bit like a Sonic game - each character has his or her own unique storyline)  and a multiplayer mode, so you can challenge each other to a race, Fish Fetch or Dolphin Soccer or something like that. So, what do you think of that?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
tethys i love you, have i not actualy cared what a sesitive person you are id put you in the blundercaves all the time and could easily make fun of you, but for some reason i actualy care, sad to say thats actualy a compliment from me ._.you know what i love about you tethys your so opininated and nitpicky, but when someone turns it on you you get relly sad about it but believe it or not i actualy like that your like that, sometimes it makes posts interesting im talking about the nitpickyness not the sad part. so yeah/Oooyyy.....I wasn't talking about the way you portrayed me there.  Nor was I 100% serious either.  Honestly, I can take criticism a lot better than you seem to think.  I know it's all for fun so you have no reason to think I'd ever be hurt by any of that.  Jesus.  I'm not THAT sensitive.No, I was referring to some of the content and pictures, and just the fact that a lot of it seemed quite bizarre to me.  But you said you'd done your job if you offended at least one person, right, so I thought being disturbing was the point.But then maybe I just don't have the right kind of sense of humor.Anyway...*goes to read new ones*

I think they are right.That's a good point.  I'm sure they did that to make it easy for kids to understand. But kids, even little kids, aren't really that dumb.  They don't need things to be repeated like that.You'd think it would shorten their attention span, too.  Because if they just repeat everything, they don't have to listen to the whole thing.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
And Arkon, you can put me in Blundercaves all you want.  In fact I wouldn't mind being in it more.  You don't have to worry about me bursting into tears or anything, I can handle a joke, and I know how to laugh at myself.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
 The point about it is that girls only say how FAT they are because they want others to disagree in front of them and to calm them down in their stupid worries. I often knew people who stood next to me and said 'I'm fat.' 'Noone likes me.' or 'I'm ugly.' They just wanted me to disagree and when I said 'You're right.' they started to freak out but after all they changed and thought about how silly it is to tell others things they don't truly believe in. The best do to about it is ignoring them. This truly helps the mankind.Some people who insult themselves in front of people just to get a compliment eventually become conceited, the same result that occurs from constant bragging.  Luckily, others become so sick of their ego, they become victims of well-deserved constant ridicule or insults.

  Dammit! Arkon, you meat-head! I saw the new additions, and thought I shouldnt go there yet, I saw them again and felt the calling... and went..and now it has me in periodic uncontrolled fits of laughter in and out of the day.

ha ha execellent, i was up till 3 in the morning doing the last one, then crest was on the phone with eccochick which keapt me up to another 2 hours and then i woke up at 9 to talk to soiela and an hour later was pulled out of my house by my friend then had to go to work.but it was worth it those are fun to do.

The same goes for me, Trellius. I can't resist and repeat reading all episodes again and again. I often have to think about it and when something's popping into my head, I just start to laugh whereever I am. Your work is excellent, Arkon, but now it sounds like you deserve some sleep. :)

You mentioned Sonic twice.Whatever happens, I don't want to see Ecco fall into the hands of EA Games. Sorry, but some of EA's latest really lack a certain shiny quality.If a new Ecco game were to appear, I think it would be perfectly suited to the Gamecube...and not just because it's code name was "Dolphin". :DAaaaack! Absolutely right Fargal! And for that matter if it is to be an RPG there is only one company that could do it right.....the mighty SQUARE!

honestly i dont remember what you did wrong, all i remember is you getting a life and thinking your better then everyone cause of your life.but in any case, you always have been welcomed back, silverfin talks about you all the time, so he'll probably be surprised to see you to.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ha hapoor ol silverfin goes to school 12 hours a day from what i heard he has had 0 freetime.anyways im glad everyone likes them, i tried to make them relly good.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
"Hooray!"
</div>

I think i was just thinking of you!I still think your one comic, where Phosis says he's going to commit suicide while holding a bottle of olive oil. Genious.well, maybe you'll make PoTD again.
</div>

And they are so sexually orientated. Its like thats all they ever think about. They aren't in on a relationship unless there is at least "some" sex. Ugh. And like everyone else has said, they are show offs! They always brag about how big their penis is, like its supposed to get a girl's attention. Yeah right.  its called biology, or would you rather humans be like other animals and just get togher for mating without "getting to know you".also the thing of Penis sizes might be more multycultural than you think, there are Natives in New Guinea or New Zealend or somthing, they wear decorive seeths on theirs. The more importan you are to the tribe the larger your dickarmor is.

<div id='container'>
i really still want to make my own Blundercaves-esque "net drama"mixing people from here, COH, GG, and other places I've visited.

<div id='container'>
What trouble did you cause?  I don't remember that.  :? Well, welcome back!

he didnt cause any trouble. he just made silverfin go D: once.

Awesome! Thanks guys. I guess ive just been more ecco influenced as of late...i found a sega genesis, tides of time, and ecco 1 with box and instructions all for a cool 30 bucks...plus ecco cd for 10 bucks...so ive been having a hayday.Ive also been doing a lot of reading lately. Namely, Journey to the west...Reading that, playing ecco. reading that, playing ecco. The two activities for me basically became one activity...and for some odd reason, doing both of these things just fit...Journey to the west has a strange layout....every single chapter has the characters fighting a common enemy, doing a common thing. At the end of the chapter, the problem is usually resolved, almost like its episodes of a show, or levels in a gameThis reminded me of the project I wanted to undertake to "novelize" ecco, which was something that never got finished, because of the massive scope of the process.I have been writing lots since then, and have come up with something I want to do. I DO want to novelize ecco still, or at least, interpretations of it, and I am. This time though, instead of being all at once like the original plan, Ive opted something much simpler; novelize each level of both ecco games seperately, and post them weekly...Like episodes of a tv show. Of course, the chapters will be elaborated beyond the original scope of the game. there were indeed levels in ecco which could be completed in a mere minute, like atlantis levels...and there was very little character developement (how much does a dolphin need to develop, I guess?) so these things will be elaborated quite a bit. I unfortunately just came up with this idea, so i dont have anything at the moment...But by the end of the weekend hopefully, I will have it written down...then I will transfer it onto computer, and submit it.As I said, its just going to be my interpretation. It will remain as true to the series as possible, and I DO promise that no major plot points will be disturbed (Ecco having to destroy vortex machinery on earth, ala the ecco the dolphin comic.) Some characters like Kitnee, big blue, blackfin, etc. will be bigger players at some points as well, not just talking heads, but the flow of the overall story will not be disturbed.If anyone has a level special to them that they want to do the same with, send me a pm, and maybe we can work something out...guest writers, and things like that. It would involve everyone in the community, which is something that would do the ecco scene good, and it would take the load of 60 or so chapters that id otherwise be doing alone (I expect each chapter is going to run around 4000-5000 words)Questions? Comments? Want to try your hand at the Ecco Novelizing Project?Also, I put in my fanfare an explenation...it contains details of the layout...how the things gonna work.http://arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Chronus&amp;file=clm&amp;func=view&amp;id=61

Hello and welcome. You don't know me and I don't know you but this doesn't matter I hope. What you've told about your project sounds interesting to me. Is it some sort of a redoing of all the different game-levels or what do you mean with that? I would like to write for that but be warned, my English in fanfics isn't truly good enough.

And I hear about these like...11 year old kids that are having sexual relations with each other? They're still babies! They've barely hit puberty.You know what? This makes me freaking out. I hate it when these babys talk about their so-called experiences and pretend to be cool only because they wasted their innocence. It's stupid but I gave up to talk to these children. They won't even listed and it's a waste of time. They believe that they got it but basically they are the poorest when they believe they can do everything aged 11 or younger. Btw, where are you from? I thought it's only like that in Germany or Western Europe.Sorry for the long wait before the reply. ^__^;;From the good ole USA (California, woo woo). I think that there's kids like that everywhere...it's so sad. It's like that's what's acceptable to them and they don't even think twice about it. How depressing is it when you meet a 13 year old who's already got an STD??

I did some modifications to the storyline; so here it is summed up.After Ecco vanishes in time all seems safe at first, although the Vortex threat still exists, reinforcments will soon come from the home world; the planet Vortex.A daughter to the Vortex Queen will establish a hive high in our orbit known as "The Web", and with this new evil she will bring a powerful drone the oldest and strongest of the Vortex known by dolphins as the Vortex King..But thats not all, a clan of of orcas who call themselves the Seven Dark Whales of Apacalypes; seek to aid the Vortex, in reviving what had once been known as the Dark Vortex Future. There task; to destroy Dolphin kind and find the ancient race of Atlantean Dolphins called "The Thirians" who hold a powerful armor strong enough to defeat armies of Vortex, the armor known as "The Wings of Burden", which is belived to be worn by the thirian god and savior of the future Arkonviox.This triggers time to split into two once again, allowing Ecco the abilitie to return to sew the threads of time together again. His return means great danger, his friend the asterite has fallen under a great infection, the cause, a creature who manefested from the tides of time, and created itself from the Asterite, a creature who's purpose is to destroy Ecco, a creature created from Ecco's worse fears, a creature known as Vernineus.Ecco will seek the help of Crestoe, the last of the thirians, to find the ancient Dolphin Armor, but instead they find the burdened wearer Arkonviox, who will betray them and fall into the trap of the dark whales.Ecco will fight the vortex defeat the queen and king, and face the dark whales in a final fight for the future, he will face the apacalypes itself and the black portal time machine created by the ancient civilization of mu to draw power from time. Arkonviox will come to redeem himself and help Ecco but become a victim to the black portal along with a dark whale from the future who will rule the world.Then all will seem safe, except; The Asterite has been abducted by Vernineus, and taken into the tides of time, Ecco seeks the time machine to follow them but in following them he relizes the final danger of time travel, and the retribution he will have to pay, the destruction of time itself!The world, the universe are destroyed, but an unsuspecting Arkonviox who finds himself trapped in the dead dark future along with Apacalypes; the great dark whale, don't relize it at first, until they start to see the effects of there glitchy world.It is the dark future alright, but the demension is unstable, and to liberate it from intire destruction Arkonviox must save the future and time itself by destroying apacalypes who was never ment to exist. And with apacalypes destruction all seems like it should have gone back to normal.But then a new world is created, the world that was hidden and ment to be found, a future that was hidden between the two, where Ecco will meet his destiny.Ecco finds himself a victim of a clan of dolphins who have destroyed most of the world, known as the Earth Clan, lead by an enimie unknown to Ecco known as Sitna. But sitna doesnt ring a bell, who is this strange dolphin warrior? the answer lies in atlantis, and even with the dolphin god himself apollo, and Ecco finds in order to stop sitna he must work alongside apollo to find the one who created atlantean technology, the one who put ecco in this world to stop the vortex in the future and save time itself, a Dolphin atlantean named Atla. But Atla is not easy to find, the only map to him is upon Ecco's head, the constallation delphineus, dephnineus represents Apollo's rise to the heavens, so Apollo is who should lead Ecco to atla, but Apollo teaches Ecco the dark secret, in order for Atla to return Ecco and Apollo must combine together, to which Atla will be reborn. They combine and Ecco reawakens stronger wiser, and now knowing his purpose, he was once atla, who's job is to destroy sitna, who will trie to destroy time itself, and return the world and universe to nothingness.Atla and Sitna have a final battle but the battle causes the destruction of time anyways, and creates a giant ripple causing time to repeat itself.the only clue at the end of the game thats left is the clue in the names of good and evil. Atla - Sitna, sitna spelled backwards Antis. Atla - Antis; Atlantis, the people who created time travel, and when attacked by the Vortex traveled into a further past to found the ancient civilization of MU, to which MU was destroyed by the black portal time machine, all the people were sucked into the tides of time, and even time itself started to become unstable. the battle between Atla and Sitna creates an Echo in time allowing the events of MU to take place again, but this time those involved in MU's destruction will have a chance to stop it and save the universe.

Thanks guys. I think it was me who did that whole science thing. Unfortunately, I dont even have a computer anymore...Im on my stepdads...so I could never get anything like that done.  all I remember is putting a nonsensical amount of effort into explaining the obscure tube ecco has to travel through (mind you, the explanation came out rather dumb.) Anyways, I have halfway completed the first chapter/episode/phase, whatever you want to call it, which describes the hero ecco, his home, his friends, and consequently, how they are all sucked away into a vortex coming down from space. Pretty sad. Anyways, ecco is mischevious. Maybe he isnt meant to be, but in this interpretation, hes a very intelligent dolphin, who knows just how smart he is. Hes tricky.Infact, much of the first chapter explains how smart he is through his encounter with Blackfin, who happens to be his rival of sorts. Ecco as you know, is special. different...this story explains it many different ways. Unlike most dolphins, ecco has actually sight. He can see with his eyes, and song. This can be justified in many parts of the actual game...the fact that in the sea of darkness, he requires song to see. (wouldnt he be able to see if his eyes were only activated through song, no matter how dark it was? why was it like that? he must have had a default vision.) He can leap higher, and move faster then most. (How high in the sky can you fly?) Some say that dolphins cant see with there eyes, so this is what i used as a tool in my story, to seperate ecco from the rest of his kind.As you can see already, this is a much more lighthearted novelization then most of the ecco series. A lot of it is done in a light manner. Ecco is by no means a smart aleck, but he is sly in his ways, especially in dealing with his many foes. How could a dolphin so easily defeat, and surpass the huge obstacles that he does if he wasnt so tricky? serious parts will stay serious (most of the second ecco game) but parts that can be bent will probably be, to make room for more explanation.Anyways, thats what the first episode will entail. The second will be eccos encounter with Kitnee, (who happens to be a friend of his) and the first of the many glyphs, and whatever the hell they are. As you can see, its a level to level basis, the chapter after that covering the encounter in the undercaves with the eight arms.As you can see, im pretty pumped about this story. Super pumped. I think its going to be pretty awesome. Anyone who wants to contribute, let me know.

*gasps for air* ...need.......period........*dies*Arkon, I've tried to refrain pointing this out, but I've noticed that you always spell "entire" wrong, and I feel I must say something so that you will not be doomed to spelling that word wrong for the rest of your life.Okay, enough badgering.  But you know I only do it cuz I love you.Anyway, the story is getting better all the time.  It was great before, but you've cleaned it up and now it's even better.  So great job with that.  I'm really looking forward to this game.But I wonder....seems you made up the name Sitna to create the whole Atla-Antis thing...So I wonder how come that name sounds so familiar to me.  Hmm...No, I think it's a real name, just not sure where it's from...

Demon here - just got back from Iceland!Hmmm...hard one...how about a page (or it may have to be pages) of ALL the characters of Ecco The Dolphin. For example, you could have a description about, um, the Clan dolphins from Ecco: DOTF. But I don't think you should give too much away. -Demon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's Demon here again. I've just got back from Iceland and can you believe it? You had to PAY GOOD MONEY just to get onto the computer!!!!! &gt;gasp&lt; &gt;gasp&lt;Anyway, Ah - Hem! Where was I? Oh, yeah - while I was there I had an idea for a new thread, so I'm posting it now. What would you say is the best piece of artwork you've sent in? Send a copy of the picture (well DUH!).And one more thing. I know this probably sounds stupid, but I have no idea how you start a gallery and send in pictures. I've already done a few - now all I have to do is make a gallery and send `em in - can one of you guys tell me? - Demon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's Demon here.So, why do you need this 'New Enigma' thingy anyway? (No offense) The site's good already...hey, wait a minuite! Sorry, Eao, I think the new enigma is taking over your discussion! The picture's cool - I like the rays of light and, well, I have to say the stone does look a bit funny...but hey, it looks good anyway. It's one of those pictures where there could be a mistake, but it's so good no one actually notices that much.- Demon
</div>

<div id='container'>
It's simple, really. My user name is Demon, so since I'm an imaginative person, (I daydream in class sometimes. Oh, dear!) I created Demon. I just came up with the idea on the day I joined. She's featured in my Zephyr Story (you can read chapters 1 and 2 now, and by the way, who said that the big, scary monster with a giant set of jaws couldn't be a girl?!), and I'm not giving you any more info. You'll just have to read it for yourself!As for Zephyr, I came up with him ages ago when I started playing Ecco: DOTF. Only when I first heard about Vorphins and the Vortex from somewhere else did I think 'Hey, those could make really cool bad guys for my story!' so when I became a member, I immedietly started working on it.- Demon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
As a few of you know, Im working on a project to Novelize the entire series, (the first two games anyway) of Ecco. Each level in the game is equivelant to about a chapter. Anyways, the first chapter is done now, so go take a lookhttp://www.arkonviox.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Chronus&amp;file=clm&amp;func=library&amp;uid=13There is more on the way. If anyone wants to try there hand at novelizing a level or two, send me a private message. Enjoy

Hey, that's really cool and well-done. One year ago we had such a project on a forum and every member was allowed to write a story about one level. It was kinda funny but because of the lack of interest, we only came to Jurassic Beach, Ecco 1, and surrendered the project. Wouldn't it be cool to revive it in a forum-based style? It would be great if anyone could join if desired but it's just a suggestion.

BOOM!!! ANOTHER IDEA!!!Hiya to you all, it's Demon.Like I just said, I've just had another idea for a new thread. Send in blurbs, all you guys who have submitted stories! Sorry, I just LOVE creative writing, so I had to do this thread. It's also a good idea because we'll all hopefully get loads more people reading our stories.FAME AND FORTUNE HERE WE COME!!!! ^_^ Here's the blurb for my story, 'Zephyr's Story'. (If you have more than one story, feel free to send in all blurbs together or one by one.)'In the future, there is peace in Atlantis...but that was not so long ago. The deadly Vorphins roamed around in the past, and if they were not destroyed in time, that peaceful future could change forever. 'Upon discovering a portal, Zephyr, a young spinner dolphin, is thrown into an epic adventure in the past to wipe out the Vorphins, and save time itself.'Pretty epic, huh? I always make blurbs sound weird...anyway, send in yours A.S.A.P!- Demon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hmmm. Well, in my story (here we go again!), the character Demon is 50% good, 50% evil. She quotes:'I'm not with the Vorphins, yet nor am I with the dolphins. I make my own decisions.'Decide for yourself. Actually, you'll see which side she turns to at the very end.- Demon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
When my gallery is created and I start sending pictures, you're welcome to get ideas from my drawings. I've already drawn my version of a Vorphin (actually it's their leader, Arko (see where I got the name from? Wink Wink ^_^) for my story (here we go again!). I've also drawn a picture of me (I'm talking about me as Demon). OK, so she's not exactly scary, let alone grusome, more noble like a Dragon or something, but hey, they may give you some ideas.- Demon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
OK, maybe not exactly like Sonic, but I must say, MULTIPLAYER RULES!!!!And blood really should be put in. We all just have to accept that blood is well, just there. (*lame excuse to put blood in*). HELLO??!! IT KEEPS YOU ALIVE!!! (*reeeeeeally good excuse to put blood in*)The game will have a rating though, Squeamish Ones, DUH!- Demon

Ah - Ha! I've e - mailed Arkonviox about this particular cheat saying that I've heard three versions of this cheat, but it all makes sense now!Not to worry, Arkonviox! I'm OK!- DemonPS: Arkonviox, I've used part of your name for the bad guy in my story (here we go again!). This bad guy is the leader of the Vorphins, I called him Arko. Heh-heh. Are you deeply touched or what? ^_^  / (peace, man.)

Hey. It's Demon. Again.Just to tell you, Arkonviox, that I've send you an e - mail about this gallery thing. Just to remind you. ^_^  / (peace, man.)- Demon

ACK!!!Artreus, I've just seen your bar that tells you your ranking. HOW FAR DO I HAVE TO GO BEFORE I GO UP A RANK??!! OH, THE HORROR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!etc..- Demon

<br />
<div id='container'>
I agree, even though that was the first time I heard about it. But it sounded cool, though.By the way, Soleila, when did you become a Transient? I wanna know, because I'm still an Outcast, and by the looks of things I've got a LONG way to go. I just want to make sure how many posts I have to send. That is all.- Demon^_^  / (peace, man.)

If any of you have read my story (here we go again!) then you'll see that the chapters are only 1 page long, if less. That's my fault. I have no idea how long the chapters are gonna be. By the way, have any of you read Zephyr's Story? If so, tell me what you think of it. I know I made the first chapter very dramatic. A bit too dramatic, I think...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I've never played Ecco 2 Tides of Time but I agree with Arkon.^_^  / (peace, man.)I always put that in.
</div>

<div id='container'>
Oh, the idea is not bad. Good writing you have.Few lines translated from German and taken from my huge book project Stella Mea, the lovestory between Soleila and Asterite (beware, the language still sucks).'Lost in an ocean of impressions he swam in his cave and felt increasingly dismayed searching for a reality that he knew - silence. If Soleila just could be with him, he thought sadly, and remembered the gentle words she told him to promise her support during the near gathering. The power of this imagination became so strong that he nearly was able to see her standing in front of him. Her shadow floated in the entrance of his chamber, she watched him with feelings he could only suspect, tried to be quiet and smiled ashamedly after he showed her that he had noticed her presence. When he remembered this moment, an overwhelming silence surrounded him, Soleila even appeared more clearly but still was hard to see. Despairedly he tried to touch her, forced her to come closer but... "Asterite! Where are you with your thoughts!?" He shivered, Soleila disappeared from the entrance of his cave and her shape was replaced by two dolphin bodies.'

Wow, you are much too often the bad guy or an inspiration for the bad guy in a story. I think you don't care about it but I truly cannot understand the reasons.

<br />
<div id='container'>
ACK!!!Artreus, I've just seen your bar that tells you your ranking. HOW FAR DO I HAVE TO GO BEFORE I GO UP A RANK??!! OH, THE HORROR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!etc..- DemonErrrr, you are using a thread like THIS to ask about THAT??? 50 is the answer but who cares? :?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh errrr, I replied in Artreus' thread to this but hey, why do you care so much about post counts? I never look at mine and Arkon posted the ranks in another thread. I do only post when I feel that I have something to say but not to up my grade. That doesn't fit a board philosophy.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I set up an art gallery for you here
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ok, maybe you're right. Actually, now I think about it, I like to be alone (maybe that's because I'm used to it.) I'll think less about my ranking from now on. Thanks for reminding me. Who wants to be a complete snob? Not me!- Demon
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It's really good, but I was really looking for an actual blurb like you would find on the back of the book. But now that I come to think of it, sometimes you do find interesting parts of the story that is inside the book as the blurb. It makes me want to read it. Good job.- Demon^_^  / (peace, man.)I always put that in unless I forget (!).
</div>

<div id='container'>
Hmmm. Tricky. I guess it's because the only game I've played of the Ecco series is Ecco: DOTF and I can only get up to the GWS on the second level. It keeps eating me. Lame, I know. Well, the little dolphin that thanks you for saving his turtle from the sharks it cute, and from what I've heard and seen from the walkthroughs and screenshots, the Clan dolphins sound pretty cool. I wanna see one in the game!Luckily, I'm using THE CHEAT so I can play all the levels in the game and do the toughest level and kill myself!!!!! Lame, I know. Anyway, now all I need now is the game. My friend is borrowing it, but she keeps forgetting to bring it back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!etc.... ^_^  / (peace, man.)I always put that on, even though now is not the time.

Why shouldn't we get you started on dreams? I think they're cool. All the vivid dreams that remind me of Lord Of The Rings (because I like Lord Of The Rings) I try to make into stories. But I hardly ever share them with anyone else because they're so weird. Once I had this really vivid dream that I woke up and there was this old guy on a flying pig who flew me off to the Dreamworld and I became its guardian. Lame, I know. Oh yeah, I flew a Pterodactyl (have I spelt that right?). Lame, I know.^_^  / peace, man.I always put that on, even if it has nothing to do with what I am discussing.

Hmmm. Well, in my story (here we go again!), the character Demon is 50% good, 50% evil. She quotes:'I'm not with the Vorphins, yet nor am I with the dolphins. I make my own decisions.'Decide for yourself. Actually, you'll see which side she turns to at the very end.- DemonShe learns how to turn eggs into dynamite and thus travels to Indonesia to patent the idea, where she falls down a man hole and dies. The end.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
YAY!!! A VORPHIN!!!! FINALLY SOMEONE LISTENED TO ME!!!I'll have a look at the picture for some ideas.I know the first line sounded lame, but after I heard of the Vorphins and Vortex I was dying to see a picture of one.WOO - HOO!!! (Homer Simpson is weird! Who's with me? If you are, take the new discussion into the Offtopic Section. Arkon will KILL ME if he sees that I've started queries (have I spelt that right?) about Homer Simpson in the Artwork Discussion section.)- Demon^_^  / peace, man.I always put that on, even if now I could start a thread about Bart Simpson.

It think it's really cool, Mutaclone. Now I'm not kidding about this, but I can see them swimming around (as allies, mind you!) in the next official Ecco game that comes out.^_^  / peace, man.I always put that on, even if I can't think of a reason why...wait a minuite...that WAS a reason!I'm funny.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Raeckon...do you always use Emoticons at the end of every line you type??!! Oh well. I'm having trouble using mine...they always turn out to be words and stuff instead of actual Emoticons. I've left - clicked on the 'Confused Emoticon' and this happens? What am I doing wrong?

OK, I'll calm down now. Thanks for telling me. I waisted page space, I know. I'll also stop using so may capitals.- Demon^_^  / peace, man.Pretty cute pic, huh?  :)

Lol, I know what you meant but since I have no cover text yet, I just quoted a part as a teaser. Why not? All post some parts of your writing. It's cool.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yes! Thats exactly what I want to happen. Forum based, I dont know...But as ive posted numerous times, I WANT people to contribute, a lot. Thats why anyone who wants to join in should give me a private message in the forum, telling me what level they want to write about. Thats not to say one per person, either. I want this to be everyones project, as long as the chapters have a relatively long length to them. So please, send in those requests...I wanna see the whole community in on this if possible!

Now that I stop to think about it, once the Globe Holder is broken free of the globe chains it does try to zone in on Ecco and crush him if left alone too long, which makes sense to say it is alive.  I'm thinking it might have been a trap built by the Vortex.

Who the fuck are you anyways? moduvators little sister? a kid moduvator lured from a nearby elementry school to be his sex slave?I havent gone to Moduvators shitty webpage for nearly 5-6 months now, in fact i dont think anyone has been to that site in 5-6 months.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i know this shold be a PM, but Arkon, are you going to upload the orginal blundercave episodes? and maybe a guide (it could be an easter egg, if you are into that shorta thing).I think people should be able to read the achient blundercave episodes, and prehaps watch the unfinished projects that were the animated versions.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I though he was in league with Mod, the second he said he was from Russia.i think you should elaborate on this and make it a 5 page special of the blundecaves.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well at least I can say I haven't heard that one before.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Arkon doesn't ban people just because they used probably the stupidest insult I've ever heard on him, you moron.  He banned you because you haven't had anything worthwhile to contribute and you were just annoying everyone.  As for your pictures, put them somewhere else.  Though I can't imagine that someone with your I.Q. could draw anything that anyone would wanna look at.  This post right here only proves that your childishness and stupidity are limitless.  I'm hurting your feelings, am I?  Well get used to it, because that's just a part of life, especially in your case.  If you grew up a little, maybe that wouldn't happen as much.  And you know something, even friendly people can only handle so much, and it's really hard to be friendly with someone who just annoys the crap out of you.  You're not gonna make many friends if you keep acting like this.Now get the hell outta here, go somewhere and grow up, and don't come back.Well whaddaya know, looks like I've been hanging around Arkon too much...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i dont have the original blundercaves, the ones that were forum based. I have the ones after that that were like episodes, i hope to eventualy upload them but not for a while, but yeah i considered it we had some relly relly good ones.

Spam! Spam!after reading your first post i would  have let you come back with restrictions but after reading the second post i changed my mind.I'm not the only ecco website on the net, you could also go to caverns of hope. they encourage you to have post more there and want you to up your post count, theyw ant you to submit stuff to them, my community its more of a group you have to earn your way in, normaly i let a new person join post, and if they dont go on a stupid rampage of threatening my site and posting nonsense topic to topic i'll let them stay, in your case i appreciate the fact you submitted stories, i appreciate that you want to do art, what i dont appreciate is the fact that you posted in old topics and double posted, and posted alot of topics, only to increase your post count, when you do stuff like that its taken as an attack on my website.you know whats funny, i never expected this out of a female; only one person in the history of the ecco community has done something like this on an ecco website and that person was male and me, and when i was banned i started my site and took over the intire ecco community, but the thing is im not worried that will ever happen to me, if someone opens a better site let them, but the fact is no one can convince me that they can out do me and no one has been able to out do me in site design and ideas.if you want back then i'll unban you withen a month, for now trie cavernsofhope.com and if you feel you still need to be here then come back a month from now, august 21 i will unban you unless i feel nessary to do it sooner. anyways take care and have fun.

You know, maybe its just becasue I cannot sink into the fame or mind  For geurilla-spam/flame/BS-talkers but I really just cannot understand why...do they get some kind of perverted pleasure from this?  "Oh yeah, look at how they cower before my might,.... I need a cold shower" ~ tipe thing? :?

You know, maybe its just becasue I cannot sink into the fame or mind  For geurilla-spam/flame/BS-talkers but I really just cannot understand why...do they get some kind of perverted pleasure from this?I've been down this route many times, alot of times its just children trying to mimick those who have an influence, this kid thinks he she has an influence. me in the undercaves days, i was alot like this kid but the difference was i had an influence on the people.now to expose the fatal flaw of our visitor, our visitor here is pretty young, my assumption 15 at the oldest. our visitor cant speak english (according to the ip this visitor is from russia same place as moduvator.) people in russia do not speak english as there first language usualy, so my assumption is this guy has no idea what we talk about on this site and appears in random topics not knowing what there about besides he/shes poor interpretation of it, and attacks like a blind puppy thinking his/her words have an influence on us.i cant help but be a little scared, scared of the fact people in the ecco community are getting dumber and dumber.belive me latly, if i ban anyone its for good cause.

I already heard about that on TV a long time ago.But I dunno.  I mean, on the one hand it would be neat if they found it.  But on the other hand, I wonder if that wouldn't kinda ruin things.  I mean then it'd lose the mystical aura and such.  It wouldn't be a legend anymore.  :?

<div id='container'>
You mean that was a girl? x.o;;  How do you know?  That kinda surprises me, I agree I would have never expected that from a girl.And to "Guest" *koff*, you sound to me like you can't be much older than 12.  And I've never seen a 12-year-old that was a good artist.  And yeah, maybe I am a little biased, as I do tend to have a slight prejudice towards pre-teens, but whetehr you beleive me or not my feelings when I was 12 weren't much different towards other 12-year-olds then they are now.In any case, sorry to be so harsh, but I guess that's what happens when I keep my mouth shut about things for too long.  Maybe I went a little overboard, but you know what, it felt good.  And I don't feel much inclinatipn to apoligize.Arkon, if I were you, I'd wait for her to grow up before letting her back in.  A month probably isn't gonna do it.

Edgar Cayce is well considered to be one of the fathers of the myth of Atlantis, his predictions of Atlantis is that of a city so far advanced we have yet to attain its perfected society, he also talks about the ancient birthland of MU which i found out has a museum dedicated to it in japan (its popular there). Anyways i was watching some show on nastradamus and was courious on Edgar Cyces predictions on the future. in my opinion, nastradamuses predictions are probably 70% vague and 20% prediction, he did mention the names of great terrors//www.near-death.com/experiences/cayce11.htmlLiberty will not be regained,It will be occupied by a black, proud, villainous and unjust man:When the matter of the Pontiff is opened,The republic of Venice will be vexed by Hister.(Century 5, Quatrain 29)

You convinced me and I guess that Psy has even forgotten how to ban people. What COH truly needs is you, Demon!You mean that was a girl? x.o;; How do you know?

You mean that was a girl? x.o;;  How do you know?  That kinda surprises me, I agree I would have never expected that from a girl.And to "Guest" *koff*, you sound to me like you can't be much older than 12.  And I've never seen a 12-year-old that was a good artist.  And yeah, maybe I am a little biased, as I do tend to have a slight prejudice towards pre-teens, but whetehr you beleive me or not my feelings when I was 12 weren't much different towards other 12-year-olds then they are now.."lyke gnow 1 tell u age dnt mater? u r mhen, lots ove dem iz gud and my fhriend"no acctualy somone did use a similuar agrument.theres a little girl called "Aliha" or somthing, and everyone loves her. even the person i've replaced as premo artist here (I have right? even if my dolphins don't look like Lassens...I can trace you know if thats what you want)

That's all pretty interesting, and there seems to be alot of truth to it. Of course, I have no idea how Cayce could have really known all that would actually happen. I must say though, I'm not sure what to think of his predictions of Jesus returning. Being as I'm not a Christian or even religious, I don't believe in things of that nature....but also, so many of the other predictions turned out to be true. And his 'spiritual battle'? Though it would be nice to think that we could have 1000 years of peace on Earth.Of course, so many prophecies and the like are so vague that it's hard to say if things are true. Though from the actual predictions that were on the site in his own words, seemed he wasn't being vague at all about things. I guess I'm not really sure what to think on the subject.This interested me though--"..where there has been a frigid or semi-tropical climate, there will be a more tropical one, and moss and fern will grow."And as for MaBus, I do believe that if Bush gets re-elected he'll do something stupid that will end up plunging us into war. But that's just common sense.

Thanks for coming up with Edgar Cyce. I never read his predictions and theories and studied Nostradamus much more. In fact Nostradamus did not truly predict Hitler, Stalin, Sadam Hussein etc. He wrote a lot of books that were lost during the middle ages and because the Inquisiton fought him, he hadn't have alot of time when he was young. When he was older, he was protected by the Spanish Queen and some friends in higher ranks. They hid him somewhere and it was very late in his life when he finally got the chance to concentrate on his predictions. That's why huge parts of his work got lost but what I truly wanted to say is that his original works show vague imaginations only. People in the 20th century started to interprete his work and then, after the World Wars already have happened, it was kinda easy to say that he was able to predict everything. So I doubt that he had clear visions. For me he was just pretty good at imagining how the world developes. I don't want to say that Nostradamus had no gifts, he truly had them but most of it all was pure interpretation and speculation. Regarding Edgar Cyce's work I'm much more impressed. It makes alot of sense to me even though I never studied Atlantis deeply. I should take a more careful look at all of it and it sounds like a key to me. Thanks for posting this. Maybe I will find out more when I finally gain more interest in Atlantis which seems to have more influence on the world than I ever expected.

I'm wondering about this topic for a very long time and I often asked myself if normal people are able to predict their own future. There are so many possibilities and I tried a lot of them. The reason is not that I absolutely want to find out about my own future but I want to find out if this stuff is all a big lie or if there is something behind it. First of all I will explain my own experiences and tries:I tried reading tarot cards and went to a professional foreteller but all they said was that you can ask some common questions about your life and the answers they give are so vague that you are always able to interprete them in a suitable way. The people I talked to only predicted some stuff that usually happens to anyone in the world, they look at your face, calculate about your family life or expectations and your personality, read in you and give you some suitable replies. That's why I don't believe in tarot, hand-reading or foretellers but I believe that there are a very few persons that have dreams and visions. Sometimes I have dreams about the future too but I don't think that they are visions. They are just imaginations about the way life could go on and it's not difficult to have such imaginations when you regard things and when you just open your mind and your eyes to notice some facts most people would be too blind for to see. There is truly nothing special about this kind of reading and so I gave up visiting foretellers because their only gift is looking at you and knowing more about you than you would confess. Same goes for other systems like card games, runes, gems, dices etc... It's all only vague and nothing that really shows a way but maybe one of you has made different experiences.Anyway, I went on with my studies and tried to use a pendulum. These things do not work for many people, you need to use a suitable one and you need to be open for it. Mine worked immediately but it completely went wrong. There are two answers a pendulum can give - yes and no. You just take it and hold it over something (a photo or a symbol that represents your question) and it starts to react when you have the right connection. Mine reacted very well but after a while I found out that it only gave me answers that I expected. If you ask a question, you have own deep expectations about an answer and the pendulum only represents your own will and your personal feelings. That was all and it truly didn't satisfy me. You can try it, it's easy and all people freak out when they do it for the first time and when it works. On first sight the pendulum seems to live and to have a free will but believe me, it's only your own will that controls it. Maybe it's even a very mild kind of telepathy. You'll see, it's fun.After all of this did not work I decided to use a further pretty interesting chance that was really cool. My mother has a book for numerological calculations (arithmantic I think). This is not a way to foretell the future but it gives the user a chance to anaylize the personality/sense of even completely foreign people or events/dates. She started to work with it and made such calculations for friends, relatives and later for foreign people too. Now she is pretty advanced and knows her stuff very well which impresses me. Foreign people ask her to make these calculations and she is so good now, that they call her on the phone after she sent the results to her 'customers' who often are extremely surprised and tell my mother that she is completly right and that it's a wonder. At the moment she has no time to work them out but in winter she will go on I think. Her essays are kinda long and run deeper than the common crap a tarot would tell you. They explain the personality and it's impossible to interprete them in a way to make them suitable for anyone. This fact surprised me and the system is truly scientific and interesting. It's based on the fact that your parents give you a name when you are born or that friends give you a nickname when you meet people later in life (or that you choose a nickname on your own). These names are your personal fate and you can calculate them using the numerological system. Unfortunately people found out that they can make money with that topic and so a lot of fake books are around. The book my mother uses is older, was one of the first translations for that system and newer books don't work so well. Maybe it also exists in English and I will check it. I searched for an English website about the system but all of them were lame compared to the stuff my mother found out using her book. Maybe this is a true chance to see through things but I'm not sure. I'm going to learn this too and my final question refers to the experiences people here made. Did you ever try anything like this, are you interested in it and what do you think is believable or not?

I made up this thread on the other board and because it became very popular there, I regreted that I did not post it here too. Anyway, if someone of you likes to tell his/her own story about the way he/she found this site and the Ecco games, feel free to reply. Tell your personal story about how everything started for you and why you are still here.That's my own one:My way to Ecco and the Ecco CommunityIn 1993 when I was 13 years old, the Sega Mega Drive or Genesis ruled my whole world. To be honest, I had nothing else to do and wasted all the time, that other girls would waste with riding or staring at posters of some dumb ass popstars, with playing Sonic games. Sonic was my hero, it was great how many parts the series had and I never felt bored. One day I decided to go to a shop with my mother (wow, I went outside), it was raining and we found a shelf with many old cheap Sega games. I searched through all of them and did not find anything that was able to catch my interest because there simply was no further Sonic game I had not tried yet. But suddenly my mother discovered an interesting-looking game and showed it to me. At first sight the game looked very boring, it was absolutely not Sonic-ish and I did not want to spend money for it (15 DM haha). So we went out of the shop but near the entrance I realized the fact that I could not go away without a game and begged my mother to wait. I ran back in and bought it without expecting anything good from it but when I tried it at home, I freaked out and loved it from the beginning on. The reason was the cool design and the way to control the dolphin which was kinda difficult. I played and played and was very impressed by Bigblue and his words about the Asterite. When I first heard the name, I tried to imagine what something like an Asterite could be and so I played on curiously. When I finally reached Deep Water and met him for the first time, I thought that he was a graphic bug or a strange underwater plant. I swam around him and expected attacks and even as he talked to me, I did not get that THIS thing was the Asterite. I hurried away without understanding a word of the English language and after a while, when there still wasn't anything that could be an Asterite, I had to accept that the thing I found in Deep Water must have been what I was looking for (man, I was so stupid). Then I wasn't able to stop thinking about that creature. I started a new game, played from the beginning on and translated the text passages with the help of my older sister. An obsession was born and the Asterite was what fascinated me about the game. I played it through (I was so shocked by the level Dark Water) for one time and after that I only played the level Deep Water using a password. Many hours were spent with looking at Asterite, I drawed him and started to interprete his text passages. Fastly I became more and more obsessed and few weeks or months later I read about Tides of Time in the Sega Magazine. That was extremely great, I bought it but it depressed me and the storyline was not very nice for me. It seriously broke my heart to see him dying and I did not understand the end of the game where he still lived. Because it made me so sad and secondly because I started to have something like a life and went out with real friends, I started to forget about the Asterite and the games after I played ToT through. I left Ecco for a very long while but the obsession with Asterite somehow remained. Ten years later after I received my internet connection and started to talk in chatrooms, I met a new friend in the Mystcommunity- forums and one day (it was the 4th July 2003) we started to talk about Ecco. Immediately I remembered the games and especially the Asterite and so he sent me an emulator and made me play the game again. I used cheats to reach Deep Water and everything came back to me. One day later I registered at COH and met many new people there. It was a strange feeling that this community and Arkonviox.com existed for so long and that I never took part. That made me sad and because all my old obsessions were back, I decided to stay there and to write a theory about the Asterite. I just wanted to make him more famous and familiar to the people and I also wanted to be accepted as his biggest fan in the world. Few weeks later I begann to write a book about Asterite and a second part is planned. I published my theories and later I also registered here at Arkonviox.com where it was also really cool and interesting. Talking to a true Ecco expert I was able to finalize my theory with Arkon's help and now I would say that I'm really attached to both sites. I simply love to be around, I'm still sad that I wasn't here from the beginning on but it's time to say 'thank you' and to give all of you a big hug. It's great that we still exist and you brought me something back that makes me truly happy...

Hm. Well, I was probably about 8 when I first played Ecco. I rented Tides of Time because it had a dolphin on the cover and I had a fondness for dolphins. I remember I could never get past the level Two Tides (such is your fate when you're a little kid). We had to return the game and that's all the farther I had gotten in it. But a year or so later when I was with my dad at a mall, we were looking around at the games and I saw Tides of Time and so I bought it. I didn't realize until some time later that ToT wasn't the first Ecco game--alot of it didn't make sense (things like "When you saved your pod the Vortex queen followed you to earth" because he'd never saved his pod in that game....) For awhile my dad was the only one who had the internet and since I don't live with him I hardly ever got the chance to get online. But once when I was probably 12 or 13 I was at his house and typed 'ecco' into a search engine hoping to find pics or something, can't remember exactly. But the link to the Undercaves site was one of the first things to pop up and I found that site facisnating. I used to go to the chat whenever I was at my dad's. I finally got my own computer and the internet when I was 14 and was saddened to find that Undercaves was no longer up and running the way it used to. But I also remember another site I had looked at, which happened to be this one. So I came back here and signed up. And I've been here ever since.

Hm. I've never really tried these things, but I do find the subject interesting. You didn't mention much about astrology and horoscopes. Not that I believe these kinds of things, quite the contrary--I find it rediculous that someone might think that these are always true. The same problem with most ways of fortune-telling and the like. It's always so vague. And there are so many people in the world--to think that all of them have the same horoscope and the same things happen to them, or whatever. I was going to experiment with rune-casting, I got a book on it and was going to make my own runes but never got around to it. That, too, is up to your own interpretation of the way the runes fall. As for dreams and visions, I have had a few dreams that the next day something like that happens--nothing monumental, maybe it's just something a friend does or something that happens. So who's to say that dreams can't really predict the future? That's what Deja Vu is, or so I believe.

Hmm...well, I can't remember if I saw the ad first or just saw the game at the rental place.  But, either way, I thought it was just the coolest thing in the world that there was a game where you could play as a dolphin.  I mean, I've always loved dolphins.  So I had to rent it, and, even though I couldn't get past the second level, I found it to be the most fun game I have ever played, besides Sonic.  I loved just jumping around and doing tricks.  So I rented it a few more times before I actually got the game.  And then I was really excited when I saw the ad for the second one.I can't remember how old I was.  I'm gonna guess about 10.  Can someone tell me how long ago the first game came out?As for the Ecco community, well I never in my wildest dreams imagined that there would actually be an Ecco web site out there.  I didn't know anyone who had even heard of Ecco, except for a couple of my friends but only cuz I showed them the game.  Even though it's not as popular as other games, I still didn't think it could be even as popular as it is now.  It never occurred to me to look for an Ecco site.  Otherwise I may have found this place sooner, that or Caverns of Hope, or the Undercaves or maybe another older site.  Anyway, it's really Arkon's fault that I'm here.  I got an e-mail from him asking if I wanted to participate in an art contest.  Of course I was interested, but I didn't wanna say I'd do it right away, cuz I wasn't sure if it was some sort of scam or something.  So I asked for more information, and got a link back to this site in response.  And of course I was very excited to find that it was in fact an Ecco website.  I went and checked the forums, it looked interesting, and so I decided to join.This is the first forum I ever joined, and, in fact, currently it's the only one I'm a member of besides Gaia.

Fargal:  You wouldn't understand, being a guy.Actually I don't think he's all THAT hot.  I mean, he's good looking, maybe even cute, but I wouldn't go so far as to call him sexy.This coming from a girl who, at the age of 12, had a huge obsession with Jonathan Taylor Thomas. e.e  But then I suppose it's more of a pre-teen thing.Now....about the age/art thing.  When you're a certain age you think everything you do is good.  When I was 12, I thought my Sonic character art was at least as good as professional. e.e  Now I look back and realize just how much it actually sucked, and wonder how I could have possibly ever thought it was good.  Now...I have seen people who were younger than me and also more talented.  But really, you have to have been drawing your entire life to be that young and that extremely talented, not just that but also worked really hard on improving, and maybe even have a bit of a natural knack for art.You also have to have a decent IQ.  And this person just doesn't seem to have that....

I dunno why this didn't occur to me before.  But if these places were real, how come they didn't leave any history behind?  If they were such an advanced society, they must have had some form of writing.  So how come nothing like that has ever been found?  Why is it that the memory of these places wasn't passed down? How come nobody can trace their origins back to these civilizations?  Why is the evidence so slim?It just seems like, if such places existed, there should be something left for us to find...things that actually prve their existence.  We should be able to find out about them the same way we find out about other ancient civilizations.And, how is it possible to have had advanced civilizations at a time when humans had just barely evolved.Why are there no remains of these people?I mean, I WANT to beleive it, but things just don't add up.  It all sounds so surrealistic.  I'm not saying it's not possible, it just doesn't fit in with all we already know about the human race and how we evolved...how the earth evolved.  Well, okay, what we "know" is mostly theory, but it's backed up quite well.  And there is a "rule" in science that says the simplest answer is probably the correct one, as that has been the case with any discovery.  But this Atlantis and MU stuff seems overly complicated.Besides....if this all turns out to be real....it might not be as interesting anymore.Hmm....but on the other hand....it would be pretty cool to be a reincarnation of someone from Atlantis.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just thought of something.  Unless the continent which Atlantis was locateed on was not a part of Pangaea (which is possible), there would be evidence of another land which once was connected to.....wherever.  Similar to the evidence that connects South America to Africa, and etc.  But then....maybe it wasn't connected in the first place...You know I was thinking not too long ago that Bush must be the next anti-Christ.  It wouldn't surprise me.there is also a possible prediction that bush will get reelected and assasinated or die before his term endsEvery president that was elected in a year ending in 0 has died in office, up until now.  Of course it's just coincidence, but it gave me hope for a while.  If Bush is re-elected I dunno if that would still count.  But still, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would like to have him dead...The Jesus thing...I always thought if he came back he'd probably just be reborn and be living as a child currently.  Not that I really beleive it....I mean I think he was a great man and all, but more than likely attributed to things he did not actually do, and turned into something greater because people loved him so much.  Kinda like how some Buddhists beleive Buddha is a god, but he was really just a teacher.As interesting as it is, I'm not sure I really beleive in the ability to predict the future.  Someone who was really intelligent and did enough research could possibly make educated guesses of what might happen.  Well, I don't really know, but it seems like that could be possible.  I mean, a lot of science fiction writers wrote about things that were later discovered or invented, or things that were actually done.  Like going to the moon for example.

people used to say the same about troy, but if you relly want to get technical, what about the bible? how do we know jesus relly existed? how do we know there ever was a moses, sure theres stories but how do we know if those events actualy took place, seems the only proff was eye whitnesses but then again we have alot of those when it comes to UFO's, dont trie to prove me wrong on this, we all know most of the stories in the bible dont have any proof.what we do know that most of the things we have now, writings how we build things, math, and many other things might have possibly taken root long before we actualy thought, everyone belvied writing began in mesopotania but in truth the egyptians had a writing system long before them.i strongly belive everything that we have today derived from ancient places such as mu and atlantis, when those cities were destroyed the survivors took what little they had including stories and much more, but only small broken fragments of it which soon re-evolved and spread throughout the world.there is proof mu exists, they actualy found it but its underwater and hasnt been fully investigated, also theres alot of sunken cities and places we know of and dont know of, that do exist because the as climate changes began and the ice age ended what we come to know as the great flood began and lasted for many many years.

Meeting Ecco Defender of the Future was in there. I became intrigued. I'm a dolphin freak so the name caught me first, but then I turned to look at the screenshots. The graphics looked incredible, anad I immediately became interested greatly. Unfortunately I didn't know where to look, so I just turned to GameStop. Whenever I walked by I would go in and check the Dreamcast games to see if it had come by. No luck usually. I tried again one day and looked over. Nothing. I was bored and looked it over again, and...there it was!! Just sitting there. I pratically gasped aloud. I grabbed it and bought it immediately. I couldn't believe what I had seen when I played it! It was the greatest game I had ever played! Meeting Arkonviox.com)

They used to say that about Troy?  But it's just right there.  I thought it still existed...Just to keep this straight, I wasn't trying to prove you wrong or say that it isn't possible or anything like that.  It just seemed to me there should have been more.  I mean those are the kinds of questions scientists have to ask themselves with things like that.  I'm not gonna be convinced Atlantis actually existed unless someone finds solid proof.As for Mu, you say they found it, but how do they know it's really Mu?  Though I guess that answers part of what I asked, if a city has been underwater for millions of years or whatever nothing's gonna be preserved very well.  So it would be really hard to tell.  Especially since there's only stories to go by, no way to really know exactly what to look for.I'm just trying to think critically here.

I only read the first couple paragraphs but I just wanna say this, because otherwise I might forget while reading the rest.  I think fortune tellers work like magicians and those people who claim to talk to ghosts.  They make judgements by closely watching your reactions, and from things that are common amongst most people.  And they're really vague, like you said, so what they say can be easily interpreted in any way.  So something would happen, and you'd be like "OMG that fortune teller said such and such, they must have meant this!"As for predicting the future, if it's even possible there are only two ways I can think of that you could do it.  One would be to have a prophetic dream.  And the other would be to go into a kind of trance, as if almost possessed or something, and speak a prophecy, like Sybil Trelawny did in that one scene in Harry Potter.  Though the dream theory seems more likely.  But with dreams it's really kind of the same way as with fortune telling.  You only remember peices of the dream, so it's pretty vague usually.  So it's easy to experience something and then relate it with something you once saw in a dream.  Now it might be more likely if you had an extremely vivid dream, and wrote it all down right after waking up.  But that would be very rare.I beleive some people do have special gifts, that they are able to tap into more parts of the brain then most people are able to.  But it's extremely rare, and I imagine people that are really the real deal probably wouldn't go around parading it.  I mean if I had a gift like that, I wouldn't wanna tell anyone because they'd probably think I was crazy.  As for foreseeing the future, if anyone can do it, it would really just be seeing a possible future.  There's an infinite number of paths the future can take, and the path that is taken is decided every second by the things people do and the decisions they make.  Not just people, but also animals, and nature.  Everything contributes.  So I don't think anyone can really predict the future.  If anything, they would only be able to see possibilites.  Maybe it would be possible to see what the most likely events would be based on the current path.  But that path can change at any time.

Anyway, I went on with my studies and tried to use a pendulum. These things do not work for many people, you need to use a suitable one and you need to be open for it. Mine worked immediately but it completely went wrong. There are two answers a pendulum can give - yes and no. You just take it and hold it over something (a photo or a symbol that represents your question) and it starts to react when you have the right connection. Mine reacted very well but after a while I found out that it only gave me answers that I expected. If you ask a question, you have own deep expectations about an answer and the pendulum only represents your own will and your personal feelings. That was all and it truly didn't satisfy me. You can try it, it's easy and all people freak out when they do it for the first time and when it works. On first sight the pendulum seems to live and to have a free will but believe me, it's only your own will that controls it. Maybe it's even a very mild kind of telepathy. You'll see, it's fun. Asking a pendulum is little more reliable than asking an 8 ball.  It's just your own touch that makes them move.  You can make little movements with your fingers without even realizing it.  That's all that goes on with those things.  You're right, though, it's your own will that makes it move in a sense.  You are basically unconsciously moving it towards whatever you want, by those small movements.Oh and btw, moving something with your mind is telekinesis, or also called psychokinesis.The last thing you talked about is called arithmancy.  I don't really know anything about it, though.  But somehow it seems improbable that you can get stuff like that just from someone's name.  Wouldn't that mean it would be the same for two people with the same name?  And most times parents don't really put a lot of thought into what they name their kids.  They'll just choose a name they happen to like because they like the way it sounds.  That makes it almost random, and it doesn't seem like you should really be able to tell anything from that.  After all your name is just a word.Hm. I've never really tried these things, but I do find the subject interesting. You didn't mention much about astrology and horoscopes. Not that I believe these kinds of things, quite the contrary--I find it rediculous that someone might think that these are always true.

And there are so many people in the world--to think that all of them have the same horoscope and the same things happen to them, or whatever. I agree with you.  Besides that, the Zodiac is based on the constellations the sun passes through, and there are really 13 now.  So even if that did make any difference over peoples' lives, what they say now is messed up because the dates are no longer accurate, and haven't been for centuries.  As for the predictions, what you read in the paper is really vague.  And it's different depending on where you read it.  Some magazines don't even put predictions, they just say "you are a person who ------", just something about your personality.  There may have been a time when people made more accurate predictions based on the stars...if such a thing is really possible, that is.  But now they just have someone who makes things up off the top of their heads.  I remember once reading in my horoscope that I was supposed to throw a party.  But that contradicts the personality profile for Virgo.  Showing they didn't even bother to match things up.  Now I find myown personality fits in pretty well with how a Virgo is supposed to be.  But my mom is an Aries and she's just the opposite.  So it's mostly coincidence.Then there's the Ouja board, which is fun, but it's the same prinicipal as the pendulum.  You make it move, whether you realize it or not, by what you want or expect.  And certainly if that kind of thing actually did work, it would have to be a real one, rather than something made by a game company.I do find these t3hings interesting.  But most methods I don't think really work.

what we do know is the stories of atlantis and mu existed for thousands and thousands of years, even though they might just be stories theres a history to them and to what there trying to describe.i strongly belive around 70,000 BC till 12,000 BC there existed a culture different from other cultures, while most of mankind lived in caves and painted on walls this culture had buildings had machines and comtemplated all day on the future the reason life exists and analzed life and dreams, and this society vanished from existence with only a few survivors who lost a great portion of what made this place so advance, so they took stories from it and passed them on through the generations, and perhalps they became misinterpreted over time.i also belvie in this old socieity something happened which even set mankind back neevr to achieve the advancements it had for another thousands and thousands of years. and it is also possible that the people from this ancient advanced place had technology that they shouldnt have had yet, and somehow it was unnatural to say the least, but it defined our world and mankind. the bible stories are probably based on it, as well as famouse legends and stuff that date back further and even technology; somehow the myth of god/or gods, came from somewhere because at some time someone was ahead of there time and advanced and the simple people looked to these advanced people as "gods" but i dont belvie they were extra terrestrials, i belvie they were a society that had figured out alot of the answers we ask ourselves today, answers to questions to this day we dont understand, and also the reaosn why we didnt find this place is because we still havent found out all the secrets in this world.you know the sphynx has a hidden chamber under its left paw but the egyptian government wont let it be excavated, mainly because of political reasons, but lets just say the reason why we havent found stuff about atlantis and mu is because we still have alot to explore. as you said with troy "its right there" but 200 years ago (i think it was) that wasnt true, people searched and searched and couldnt find it. i might be wrong and its descovery was only 20-50 years ago. and where does troy come from? from stories homer use to tell, "myths", alot of people since ancient times belvied atlantis existed, some people even traveled there; to say atlantis doesnt exist is the same as saying jesus doesnt exist. how do we know jesus existed? there is no evidence of this, all we have is word of mouth just like atlantis and mu. alot of people know and knew it existed and told stories of it, same goes for troy and jesus, or how about king solomon, theres no proof of him, or moses. so yeah kinda makes you think twice. cant comfirm atlantis is real but the myth behind it and mu is based on real places, just dont expect to be able to find evidence to prove everything, because if evidence is proof jesus lived then jesus never existed. we think we found evidence of him but you tell me, maybe it was a popular story back then and thats why we have things like the deadsea scrolls, or how about moses? who was the pharoh who opressed him? some say rameses but then again it could of been just a story done by a jewish slave to inspire other jewish slaves, and thnigs were based on other stories and real people but retold differently.oh yeah just to add on, the bible talks about such a place: the garden of eden; it was a perfect paradise, where mankind had everything and lived in peace, but then something went wrong and all the people were driven out of paradise. this storie seems to echo in atlantis and mu, they too were perfect places, the people had everything and then it was destroyed.

I remember when I first came to this site and saw the quality of the artwork here...I was lost for words.Because it was so good, or because it was so bad? ._.To reply this too, the artwork here is the best I've ever seen on the complete internet. I don't know if it was like this when this site started but for now it's incredible. When I first came here I stayed because this is the older community and the age of people is higher. The discussions reach way deeper and it's more interesting here because you can talk to people who know their stuff.

Asking a pendulum is little more reliable than asking an 8 ball.  It's just your own touch that makes them move.  You can make little movements with your fingers without even realizing it.  That's all that goes on with those things.  You're right, though, it's your own will that makes it move in a sense.  You are basically unconsciously moving it towards whatever you want, by those small movements.Yeah, that's exactly what I expected. You do not realize the movement of your fingers and so you believe that your will moves it but have you ever tried to use it with closed eyes? Then it moves very very slowly but it gives you different replies that might be more right and less influenced because you don't expect these kind of replies.Oh and btw, moving something with your mind is telekinesis, or also called psychokinesis.The last thing you talked about is called arithmancy.  Tethys, you rock. Thanks for giving me the correct vocabulary.Arithmantik = arithmancyTelekinese = telekinesisI hate it when I'm lacking of words and when I'm too lazy to walk downstairs and get my dictionary which should always be next to me. ;)

for some reason i might not relly belvie in psycic powers and reading minds and thoughts, well i dont belvie humans can do it, but then again i still trie to keep an open mind and dont relly rule out that its not possible and such. same with dreams; dreams are ethier one of two things, or both; they can ethier be messages from someone to you; or you thinknig too much and putting pieces together.but mainly i think anyone can foretell the future much like nastradamus; or even a psycic who is real. its all based on analying people places and things and events and putting these pieces together from what you know about history and human responces and cacluating a path of possible futures based on what happens.i also belvie people can be "read" and seen through and evaluated based on appearence, the way they talk, there parents and there stature; most people label this as stereo typing but its only stereo typing if it is based on a group of people and not an individual.but from what i know about people i do know there culture can tell you alot about an individuals habits. from that adding onto other things you can also determine how this person reacts to certain things and how they will respond. i notice i test people alot to see there responces to see if i was right on what a determined about the individual.as for the future; lets demonstrate what i was talking about and put things together to see what the future of the united states will be shall we :Dtwo possible things will happen; john kerry will be elected, or bush will be elected, if john kerry is elected it doesnt mean there will be one possible future of what will happen with him as president because there are many things that could happen. but we can caculate one of them based on certain things we currently know.anyways if bush is elected heres one thing i think might happen;if bush gets re-elected and his policies remain the same then expect it to be the begining of the end, if john kerry is elected, the united states will be left under a weak leadership and we will be caught off guard, but in my opinion kerry i hope wins, but if hes elected i see a future where the united states will face its ultimate fate, the beginnig of the end the beginnig of world war 3, if bush is elected i dont belvie there will be a world war 3, but we will be involved in so many wars will end up like the soviet union and collapse.the sooner world war 3 happens the sooner the ultimate fate of the world is met, even if bush is relected the collaspe of the united states will only postpone world war 3, if world war 3 happens billions of people will be killed but when its over the world will never fight another war again and will unite much like after world war 2 when the jews formed isreal and looked at the holocaust and said "never again" problem with isreal is thuogh like the killer they have taken on animalistic traits, they only care about there own country and will become power hungry eventualy and be the cause of a war between themselves and the middle east.when the US becomes weaken isreal will be strong enough to start a deadly war in the middle east, they will use there nukes they created but the countries around them will use ones they obtained and isreals ultimate fate will be total aniliation, it will have too much radiation for anyone to survive there.anyways id write more but im pretty tired.

As many others before I was wondering about the glyphs in the Ecco games. Of course these message crystals have an important purpose in both parts of the series and we get vague knowledge about their origin but I'm wondering if they have any historical background or if they are only an invention of the game creators. I never studied Atlantis carefully and maybe there is some sort of a legend about these crystals. I also wondered why they are located at so many different places in the game. They can be found even in the past and this is only explainable when the Atlanteans used their time machine to place them. Whatever, I really want to know if something like this ever was possible or if I merge stuff with the reality. What level of technology did the Atlanteans truly have and did they even exist?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
wow, how profund Arkon. But on the subject on reading somone's personality or mind from posture, what if they have an illenss that inhibits them from "holding themselfs correctly"? Like myself with my back, or mentaly retarted folks or even those with Palsy disorders?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
explained that already;Many of you probably wonder where the idea of glyphs came from and how it ties with atlantis and ecco the dolphin.the answer was that story came from readings from a prophet named Edgar Cayce.I found a pretty good site about alot of this stuff, although it sometimes tends to get a little overly wacko spiratual it seems to have relly relly good information gathered from many sources about many ancient worlds like agartha, Mu, lemuria, shambhala and atlantis.http//www.crystalinks.com/edgar_cayce.htmlthis is information about edgay cayce.http//www.crystalinks.com/lemuria.htmlifnromation on mu but gets kinda crazy until you reach information on james churchwood who descovered it.

yeah it can be its a little more difficult; ive noticed most people who are in a wheel chair and unable to move phsyicaly except for twitches and stuff usualy have a fine working brain above, and you see them crie alot ect ect because sometimes it gets annoying not being able to control your own body.then theres the other kind where you can control your body but your brain is all messed up; but that doesnt make those people stupid belive it or not there was a guy once who was shot in the head and lived with half a brain; in fact he can walk because the half of his brain took over functions the other half used to be in charge up, if worked on enough the brain can take on functions that damagae parts of the brain used to handle.as for you eao when i first seen a picture of you it was as expected; i didnt relly think you had a condition until you brought it up but i always kinda guessed you had some sort of problem because you allow that problem to hold you back.

Well you have a point.  There are a lot of things in science that people generally take to be fact, but they're really just theories because we haven't found a way to prove them yet.  As certain as these things seem, they could one day turn out to be wrong.  After all, people used to be really certain that the earth was the center of the universe, and that flies spontaneously generated from rancid meat.  There's still the idea that this all seems overly complicated.  But...then that could be just how it seems now because we don't have enough information.  The answer could turn out to be very simple.Thing about gods, though, I thought people just told stories about them to explain things they couldn't explain.  And they needed powerful beings to be able to do these things.  But that's still an interesting idea.  I've been reading this book on Celtic mythology and it talks about the gods as if they were an entire race.  In fact the gods eventually became the fair folk or fairies.  The stories talked about a few different groups, including gods and giants, that inhabited Ireland before the Irishmen--the mortals--actually arrived.  From reading this book it sounded like these gods were people that the Celts ran into when they first arrived at Ireland, and for some reason or another thought they were gods.  But no one could figure out the exct identity of these people, though there are some theories.  But if what you say is really true, than perhaps it was this advanced civilization that they came across.  It would make sense, if such a civilization actually existed.  Also, it'sd been a while since I read this part, but I seem to remember a breif mention of some land that was like an Eden, a land similar to Atlantis and the like.  Such places are quite common in European mythology, actually.I have beleived that mythology of any kind is based more or less on things that are real.  Like some of the battles the Greek gods fought reflected actual battles.  So it makes perfect sense that Atlantis and Mu are based on some place or culture that actually existed.  But things tend to get twisted around in stories and evolve into something much greater than they actually were.  Someone who did some good deed is transformed in legend into a mighty hero who did a great deal more than the actual person ever did or could even be capable of.  Well I'm just kinda going off on a tangent here so I'll stop there.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
then theres the other kind where you can control your body but your brain is all messed up; but that doesnt make those people stupid belive it or not there was a guy once who was shot in the head and lived with half a brain; in fact he can walk because the half of his brain took over functions the other half used to be in charge up, if worked on enough the brain can take on functions that damagae parts of the brain used to handle.That's been proven more then once.And they say geniuses often have some kind of mental disorder.  A lot of great artists and people who are admired now for the things they did were clinically depressed.Anyway, what makes you think a World War III will happen if Kerry is elected?
</div>

Hi! I'm Alberto, I have been a member for three years, but this is my first post in the forum (I didn't visit the site in a very long time).  I just wanted to know your opinion about the upcoming Appaloosa game, SOLE PREDATOR, since I haven't read anything about it in the site (It seemed strange to me, since it is an oceanic adventure just like Ecco's games, but involving a shark this time). I believe it's a great idea, but what do you think? Links//www.appaloosacorp.com/solepredator/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/496/496603p1.html

i just think we will be caught off guard, im not saying kerry will be weak on national defense im just saying there is a possibility that terrorists will take advantage of a new president who isnt prepared for office and the worse will happen; but i belvie kerry is a better choice.and if bush is elected we will fight to many wars causing a collapse of the united states; these arent accurate but more the worse of what could happen in ethier situation.i think at some point in our future the united states will collapes eventualy it will be smaller and weaker and be known by a new name; similiar to the name now but different and i also see parts of the US no longer inhabited like where california and nevada used to be.i also belvie world war 3 must happen; theres to many people in the world and more people = less chance of peace while less people = more chance for peace. plus i think the benefits of world war 3 when its over will make people wake up from ignorance, greed, and make people accepting and caring and closer, people will remember what happened and do everything to prevent it from happening again; but the world is to corrupt because theres to many people; people who dont care about ideas except for there own; and nothing can be done to save people from pride and greed, its time for another war to solve this so people can wake up and relize: no more.

i dont know much about the game but it looks pretty decent, almost like grandtheft auto but your a shark o.o
</div>
<br />

Well now, cant see why this topic was never thought of before. Where to start..... Well my own  little trip down memory lane isnt quite as long or exciting as Others, like Soleila's, but heres my 2 cents3 *pam pam pammmm*  I played it nonstop for the longest time, I dont recall how long, but there were many things I didnt understand in it, not important for the gameplay itself, but since I was obsessed I had to know and started searching  the net on a nearby internet cafe's pc, here I happened  in the Undercaves, and have been locked in it, which became Arkonviox.com to this day. ^^ There.hmm, i wouldnt call myself as part of any ecco community, i have barely played any of the games...Sad, might I make a request that you include a few pieces in your collection with the same style as the MEga CD version? The semi clasic-ish kind? I dont remember the name of your 2nd posted one here way back but I loved it especially.

As a bit of side information, looking at the shape of the glyphs, they seem to be a form of quartz crystal. This fit in brilliantly with what happens in the game since quarts has the ability to change shape when you induce an electrical field to it, and also discharge elecrical field if foced to change its shape. Sound familliar? Seen it in the game perhaps? And for that matter we use quarts to tell time with in modern day watches. Those guys in Apaloosa really did their homework.

Well that does make sense.  I have no doubt that there will be a World War 3, I've thought it for a long time.i also belvie world war 3 must happen; theres to many people in the world and more people = less chance of peace while less people = more chance for peace. plus i think the benefits of world war 3 when its over will make people wake up from ignorance, greed, and make people accepting and caring and closer, people will remember what happened and do everything to prevent it from happening again; but the world is to corrupt because theres to many people; people who dont care about ideas except for there own; and nothing can be done to save people from pride and greed, its time for another war to solve this so people can wake up and relize: no more. I'm not too sure about this, though.  I'd like to beleive it, but I just can't bring myself to beleive the human race will ever change for the better.  It's just a part of our nature.  Humans have never been able to live at peace with one another, from prehistoric times when people of different tribes battled against each other.  There weren't very many people back then, but all that's changed is the way we fight and some of the reasons.  I don't think we can ever live together in peace.  It just doesn't seem likely.  You might think that after a huge war we'd learn from our mistakes, but the human race in general has never been verey good at learning from past mistakes.  The first World War was supposed to be the war to end all wars.  So was the second.  But it didn't happen that way, and I don't think a third world war would be any different.
</div>

<div id='container'>
how do they change shape?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i think eventualy there will be peace but not after sacrificing billions of people, the bible fortells that only the good few will survive while the wicked burn; i dont belvie the bible but i do belive the message; the message has existed before the bible; mankind has been at war since they came into existence; they were hunter who competed; there has never been a time of peace because someone always wanted power; but eventualy there will be balance; it seems the rule to life is balance is not possible; nothnig can ever be perfect; but then again humans subjugate there flaws knowing there flaws but not trying to fix them; of were aware of our flaws why dont we trie to fix them? why do we blame ourselves saying "well i cant help it" you cant help it cause its your choice! thats what sorta makes us different from animals and yet we still cant control our animalistic emotions; emotions arent human; being able to reason is human; emotions and acting upon them is an animalistic trait; animals get sad, animals get angry, if you dont belvie that then your too dumb to be in this topic; so in order for there to be perfection we must do away with emotions, or master controlling them; i see only one religion fit for the world but still needing perfecting and thats buddhism, christianity doesnt teach having a perfect mind, controlling your emotions, because such traits are the only way to acheiving perfectionism, its a way of controlling your mind and excersing it to its fullest ability.i dont want to bash chrisntity or the other religions but what are they teaching besides war? when was the last time you seen a buddhist extremist? theres always been muslim extremists (black panthers, nation of islam, some of our middle eastern friends) theres been christian extreemists (remember the romans? remember the crusades? or how about the klu klux klan?) or how about judiasm? (come on, you may not be able to find any extremisn in it but anyone who belvies you must be born a jew to be a jew and that jews are the chosen people to be saved and everyone else will die; well thats the ultimate flaw of judiasm right there)only two religions i seen welcomes anyone and there beliefs; buddhism and sikh; both preach peace and achieving a perfect mind through meditation; anyone who thinks medataton is bullshit is bullshit medatation is finding the answers withen yourself; but everyone always looks to god; wishing through prayer to a magic genie who probably doesnt hear them, or isnt lsitening.if theres a god then god is neutral and not on anyones side, god is no different from fate; balanace; and from the way our world looks seems good cannot exist without evil and visa versa, why do we hate evil do much? without it there would be no balance; we would be in a world with fake happy people, so the only way to attain perfection is to be something in between; not evil and not good; just doing what must be done, for the purpose of the world and the universe.

you know the egyptians belvied there gods once actualy lived and where pharohs.theres one such interesting story about a king named king scorpion, who was the very first pharoh to rule both the south and the north, after that began the pharohs we come to know. anyways king scropion or as some of us might know him as the scorpion king was said to be the kind to start writing; before the mesopotanians; so writing came into existence because it was ordered to be, they used it to basicaly mark recepits for goods they traded then it became a writing system.they found proof of king scorpion recently so he exists.but before him it was belived the gods were kings; perhalps they were real but there stories were exaggerated.the story of Osiris and seth, how osiris was betrayed by his evil brother, who killed him and chopped him into pieces scattering those pieces all over egypt. and how anubis and osiris wife gathered those pieces and restored him together, bringing him back to life so he could travel to the afterlife, allowing him to be free. you know after the egyptians were starting to convert to one god they had a new god which was a combination of RA and a god named Amen who was introduced to egypt.anyhow Amen-Ra is the reaosn why at the end of prayers we say amen because the egyptians did this to ebgin and end there prayers, so in a way we are paying tribute to Amen-Ra the egyptian sun god.

I think tis time to babble my history;i first came to the ecco community while searching for news about an ecco 3, i stumbled upon the undercaves once and then never seen it again; then i stumbled upon it again in the summer of 2000 where i came to the site without knowing anything about web design and anything!anyhow the ecco community was created by blackfin who started the whole idea of creating an ecco the dolphin fansite, rumors say there was an ecco website before the undercaves called "the stars of ecco" but i think its bullshit. the ecco community began because of blackfin.anyhow after that i created my website originaly intended to pratice web design and have a site to keep information about the game i want to develope someday. but what ended up happening was i kinda noticed i had a gift and had the ability to make this website more, so it is one of the biggest websites on ecco, may not be as active as it was in the old days but if you have faith i can show you how your wrong and that this community has alot of juice left in it.

Where did you learn about this anyway? It's really interesting.

Yeah I knew about Amen-Ra (or Amon-Re).  But I didn't know about the amen thing.But actually the singular god was called Aten.  The king Atnaten (not sure if I spelled it right) was the first of the pharoahs to beleive in one god...but he wasn't well liked because the people still refused to beleive there could only be one god.  His name was originally Atnamen, but he changed it to the name of his god.  His son Tutenkaten changed Egypt's religion back over to polytheism and changed his name to Tutenkamen...the one we know as King Tut.I don't know very much about Egyptian mythology though.  I'd like to learn more about it.

You have good points, Arkon, but I still can't say I have much faith in the human race.Not that I'm all for war or anything, but don't you think things might be kinda boring if everything was all peaceful and stuff?  And besides that, I don't think that it should be that way...I mean I don't think the world is meant to be that way.  How can you know what happiness is if you've never been sad?  How can you understand peace if there's no war?  When there's war and strife and struggle, we learn to appreciate the things we have.  Without that, it's all just taken for granted.  And without all those problems, without any suffering, no one can really truly be happy.  It's just like you said, the world must be balanced, you can't have good without evil.  Well that means you can't have peace without war, you can't have happiness without suffering.  The world would just be really gray and dull without all that stuff.  Sure everyone hates war, but that's just a part of how things are, and I don't think we can really exist without it.  Not the way were meant to.I would reccommend reading The Giver.  It's a young adult novel, but it's still very good no matter what age you are.  And it illustrates my point perfectly.  It takes place in the future, where the world is perfect.  War, crime, poverty, and hate have all been eliminated.  But it can only be done with certain sacrifices.  And the biggest sacrifice is true happiness.  Sure people are content, but they can't understand true happiness because they've never experienced greif.  All memory of anything that might be painful is all but wiped out, with just a single person to carry on the burden.  But it's not just sad memories they're missing, but happy ones as well...memories of all the things they no longer have.  The really sad thing is the people don't have the ability to love.  They don't know the true meaning of the word.  If you can't feel love, you can't be truly happy.  And that's what would happen if we got rid of all the things we see as problems in our world.  You couldn't get rid f those things without also sacrificing some things, some of the things that are truly wonderful in this world.So as much as I hate war, I can't forsee a world without it, and I'm not so sure that such a future would really be so great anyway.

ha hayou actualy see things the same way i do;basicaly your right there cant be love without hate, there cant be happyness without sadness.when i think of peace i sorta think of mu; i imagine it as a place that was a paradise, everyone wasnt happy though but the people there were very intelegent and sort of aragant too, they felt there world was the center of the universe and that they had the answers to everything in life, they were sort of people who spent all day contemplating life; you know steven hawking, seems his thoeries are just based on a great iamgination if you look at them; i suppose he just imegines his ideas and uses evidence to prove them. i imagined mu like this people would sorta medatate answers thinking deeply and finding a philosphey and meaning in everything probably finding the true answers.i think about them alot myself; what does god need to exist if theres a god? god would need time, because without time he couldnt have created the world, and without time he wouldnt have come into existence. i belvie in the sikhism rule: "The goal of human life is to break the cycle of birth's and deaths and merge with god." this could have several meanings, it could mean find a way for humans to evolve enough where death can no longer happen. but if you remove the merge with god part and say The goal of human life is to break the cycle of birth's and deaths." you could be saying breaking the cycle of time, which could be unnatural and never ment to happen, perhalps we were created to break a cycle, imagine the universe was in an eternal sleep, in a peaceful rest and something happened to break this balance and awaken it, so now it seeks a way to correct the balance and restore it back to its neutral state.anyways mu wasnt a super peaceful place but it was easyier to work together for a common goal, but there was an inbalance, there were the humans who were not enlightened ones who lived in caves and were thuoght of as inferior, then there was those in the very society who had different beliefs and relied more on technology then the spiritual persuit or 'zeal'.and thats what caused it all to end.

That's cool, Trellius. I think I get what you posted and it makes a lot of sense. I'm wondering if this system would be possible in real when we use our current level of technology.Which system do you mean Solly? The way the glyphs in the game were used? It is possable, as long as all the information is stored in energy paterns. Trouble is it will only be able to discharge once, so if you miss the message you dont get a 2nd look. XDCrystals have long since facinated me Teth, along with dolphins, and both are a core elemebt in my "world" the one I use for story writing and game meaking, as well as Roleplaying. :p &lt;wears his im a geek and proud of it patch&gt;And Arkon, thats not quite what was meant XD

Nothing terribly exciting on my account; a neighbor in Alabama (maany years ago) had the first Ecco game and I loved it, so I asked my mom to buy me an Ecco came, and she ended up purchasing the second one. Fine with me. Loved it, couldn't get enough of it, adored the whole idea of it even though I was too young to really understand the grand concepts. Now I miss it terribly. &lt;3

Quartz and Rochelle salts show the phenomenon of piezo-electricity, or development of electric charge as a result of pressure.  A suitable piece will show a difference of potential on two of its faces as high as several hundred volts, when vigorously twisted.  If properly cut, will develop a few volts difference of potential between its opposite faces, when squeezed.  These crystals develop a charge when their shape is changed, and as the phenomenon is a reversible one, they change their shape when charged.This peculiar action makes it possible to control the frequency of oscillation of a triode by the mechanical vibration of a piece of quartz.  Now quartz is, mechanically, a very perfect material; it is extremely elastic, having almost no loss due to viscosity.  A piece of quartz, started into mechanical oscillation by a blow, will bivrate for a very long time, as compared to steel and other elastic materials.  Quartz then requires but very little energy supply to maintain it in mechanical oscillation.  Weather conditions and temperature have practically no effect on the elastic properties of quartz, so that the natural period of vibration of a piece of quartz is practically a constant; certainly it is constant to a very small fraction of 1 per cent.A normal quartz crystal is somewhat hexagonal in form, more or less pointed at one end. The longitudinal axis of the crystal is called its optical axis; polarized light sent through the crystal along its axis will have its plane of polarization rotated, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, as the crystal is a right or left-handed one. Sometimes a crystal, during its period of formation starts to grow right handed and the stops and grows the other way. Such crystals are said to be "twinned." This twinned structure is not evident to the eye but must be investigated by the action of polarized light or similar test. It is possible to find a crystal which has grown in several layers, alternate layers having opposite rotations.What? You got me started  :P

Maybe if I read that more slowly I would have understood it better...I have a crystal at the cottage.  I also have several tumbled quartz gemstones..dunno if those would work.Is this with any kind of quartz?  What about rose quartz?Or how about amethyst?  I read somewhere they are actually a variety of quartz.  I have amethyst crystals..
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No I think the stereotype of Brittish people just kinda also fits the stereotype of gay people.  Because they're supposed to dress well and be all proper and the way they talk and stuff.  It's just a merging of two stereotypes.You probably have to live in the United States to really understand it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Okay I see what you're saying.But...it sounds almost as if the reason it all feel apart is because some people had different ways of thinking.And I've thought of this before, but I didn't think to say it...It seems like in order to acheive a peaceful world, everyone would have to be about the same, with little to no diversity.  The reason why we fight each other, or at least a major reason, is because we have so many differences.  But diversity is ultimately a good thing, it would just kinda suck if everyone was the same.It's just too bad there isn't a way to have peace at the same time as true happiness and diversity...and other important things.  If there was a way to do that...and maybe there is...but I can't see it.That thing you said about having no death reminded me of a story in which a man captures Death in a bag.  And then no one can die and so they just keep getting older and having more health problems.As a race humans have always tried to find ways to reach immortality.  But I just have the feeling that if we ever reached it, even if it included eternal youth, that we would eventually come to realize it's not such a great thing.Personally I think we should just go back to the ways of Native Amercians and other similar cultures.  Sure they still fought each other, but at least it didn't involve blowing up entire cities.

I'm sure you all know I'm pretty much retarded.From time to time I like to open up my webcamming software and take pictures which fit into this catergory of "modern art". Basically, I take a photo and move about whilst the photo is taken, resulting in some confusing/funny as hell pictures.So here are a few I've gathered for your viewing pleasure.(Please note that these pictures are unedited and are very disturbing.)http//img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/FargalEX/Modern%20art/Picture23.jpgA friend of mine has a spasmhttp//img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/FargalEX/Modern%20art/Picture47.jpg...and the evil baby doll.http//img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/FargalEX/Modern%20art/Picture50.jpgDon't ask.http//img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/FargalEX/Modern%20art/Picture54.jpgSpot the odd one out!http//img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/FargalEX/Modern%20art/Picture83.jpgCorpse of light!http//img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/FargalEX/Modern%20art/Picture90.jpgThe following pictures are in black and white...because I had that setting turned on.http//img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/FargalEX/Modern%20art/Picture92.jpgThe dead rise!So that's my lot.

Hey guys!Don't believe that I'm dead or even worse: that I left this place. My computer went down one week ago and I guess that a virus or some crashes made me loose my internet connection for a while. The last few days of my great so-called vacation I spent with calling my provider, getting on people's nerves and trying to fix it but at the end it all led to the terrible last option to completely format my harddics. I lost everything but the results are great. I'm back online, my i-net works again and I really felt like dead. I still need a few days to reinstall everything I'm missing but be sure that I will be back soon. I hope noone worried about me, I'm fine and I'm so glad to got my life again!It was terrible without you!

I think that achieving peace could also be possible with very different people and it just depends on our development level. An example: during the middle ages, in less civilized countries or in the distant past humans were very aggressive. Strength was what decided about the level of power a person had, there were no rules that protected weaker groups and anarchy ruled the world. Later people built up a system and improved. Okay, violence and hate still exist today but maybe we will achieve more in thousand further years because we learn and move away from what makes us so blind today. I am not sure about this but I can see a development of the mankind and even if it seems bad in these days, I do not loose my hope. People will learn to live with others difference but they will need a long time for it. And btw, it's only difference that causes changes and improvements. If we all were alike we wouldn't go on and if the world would be perfect, it would finally ruin itsself because it's against human nature and progress as a whole.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well, my theory for why the drones did what they did is this.The Dark Vortex Future is in termoil. The drones took the last 2 globes to their future after getting knowledge that ecco was rebuilding the asterite. The drones were all at lunay bay when ecco arrived. He kills some of them and the drones see him as a huge threat. They immediatly send their most powerful drones to capture him and take him to thier future(obviously to kill him). If you notice, the drones have a very bad reaction to air, you can tell because if they chase ecco to close to the surface they explode. Thats when they rush and take him to their future(since they had to rush to get him away they were not thinking clearly). They arrive at a place that is way too close to air and they immediatly explode. Now ecco is free to take the globes. All this because the drones were not thinking clearly. I think my theory is right? What else could of happend?

Yo, I hear tonz of diffrent opinions from gamers in my town and on the net. I usually hear that this game is in fact a sequel to the tides of time. And on the other hand, people like arknoviox tell me that it cant be a sequel because there is no connection. So if you would, please post what you think.If you think it is, put yes and give good description on why you believe it is.If you dont think it is, put no and give good description on why you believe its not.My personal opinion, it in fact could be, ecco may have been sent to earth's future and the foe could be the vortex. The creators would have to realese a sequel explaining this before I truly believe it is. Also, in all the game magazines I have ever read, i usually read this?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Does anyone agree with my theory?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well my ecco experience will live on with me until the day i die. Heres how it all got started.I was 6 yrs old, my mom had just went birthday shopping for my older brother. When he opend the present containing ecco the dolphin, i have to say the cover looked awesome. Dolphins have been my favorite animal ever since I was 3.  I told him to try it out. First thing I remember was the huge storm that happend out of nowhere. I always blamed myself for it.(I blamed myself because I told my brother to see how high he could jump....LOL) From then on I wanted to constantly play that game. My brother thought it was stupid and boring so he gave it to me.   The tides of time.  I was so happy to see that game. I had no idea that it even existed. It was so awesome. I put it in and immediatly started playing it. For the next 4 years I played it and loved it. Some time later on(about 4 years ago) I was reading this magazine, it had a picture of ecco the dolphin and I said kool, thats when I read that it was a new ecco game coming out for the sega dreamcast. I was so happy to read this. That christmas I got a dreamcast with Ecco: DoTF. I was very dissapointed with the game, I absoloutly hated it. I found out that there was no connection with the tides of time or anything. I almost cried because I loved the story of the originals so much. After a few weeks of playing I finally just stoped caring and played it. If the game would of continued the story of the originals it would of been the best ecco game ever.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, i am sorry to say but I just dont like what you have done with your story of Ecco the dolphin. His entire personality is completly diffrent than what I have thought for so many years. You put:"No such force in this world could ever take something that far. Surely, my friends are in the next pool. I will find them there, eating all the yellow fish they can find, and mocking me for being so silly, and laughing that I was so blind to stay here, like a fool! Those malicious singers are just playing a game with me, thats all!" This makes Ecco seem like he wasnt scared or nervous. His life was full of woners and joys but then his entire world that he knew and loved was taken from him in the blink of an eye. I always thought ecco was so scared that he swam very far away from his home and ended up on level 2. lolHis attitude should of been complelty diffrent, fix that and you will have a great story...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
No, there really is no connection except for Ecco himself.  They call it a sequel because it has the same name.  You can think of it as kind of like Final Fantasy, and a lot of other RPG series, where the stories of each game has nothing to do with any of the others, but they release them under the same title because it's familiar and more people will buy it.  DotF is no more a sequel to ToT than PSO is a sequel to Phantasay Star IV.  There are no glyphs, or at least the term glyph is never used.  There is no Asterite.  The Foe bear no resemblance to the Vortex.  None of the characters that appeared in the previous games, besides Ecco himself, make any appearance in DotF.  The story does not follow or even intertwine with the stories of the previous games in any way that I could see.  They didn't even explain how Ecco got out of the tides of time, which he was said to have been trapped in at the end of ToT.  In fact, when I read the instruction manual, it talks about Ecco as if he had never been in the tides of time, had never traveled to the past and future, had never had any of the adventures he had in the other games.  It gives the impression this Ecco was born in the present of the time that the game takes place.  It's as if the Ecco in DotF is a different dolphin who just happens to have the same name and markings.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
hmmm, well, you do have a point. i hope arkonviox can finish his game so we can finally have a great ecco game that continues from the old one.
</div>
<br />

He doesn't want to think that they've been taken, that anything out of the ordinary has happened.In any case, how do you even know what's correct in regards to Ecco's personality?  We never get much of a glimpse of what he's like.

Well guys, I am writing a very long story that will be the ultimate sequel to Ecco the tides of time. It even ties togethor the defender of the future once and for all to the tides of time. It all makes sense, this will take me awhile so be patient.  :P
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
This is also a sequel to the defender of the future.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It seems to be cool. I would play it even if it's not Ecco. If we can't get more, we should take what we get if we only will get it...errr... forGET it.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I think there is no connection because there could not be any. The reason is that the team that made DotF had no idea about what happened in the previous games. Games are made by people and if even the creators tell something like that, we all have to face the fact that there can't be a connection. It's also sad that DotF looks like a worse re-telling of Ecco 1 if we take a look at the characters (guardian, the foe etc.). I don't know why this has happened and the only way to connect them is talking about parallel universes which I doubt to be the reason behind the games' resemblence.

It will be interesting once this story continues on. Everyone sees Ecco differentely, in every chapter written by a different person he will change a lot, but hey I'm looking forward to it anyway.  
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Just like Asti and Tethys said, there isn't a connection. Because there were two different writers, there were  two different storylines. The games don't have a connection with each other. They don't follow each other at all. It may be the same Ecco, but until there is an official connection that everyone can follow the games will be split. There will be just a gap there. Some people have created their own connections in fanfics and stuff, but until there is another game, which there might never be, there won't be a true connection.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
haha, yeah Arkon is already having a real game underconstruction, but it's interesting to see connections others make. Care to give a preview spitfire?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Hey it looks really cool, but I have a bad feeling that it won't help at all on the Great Whites reputation...maybe not.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It looks like you've watched the tape form "The Ring"*phone rings*Cool! I got that tape as a screensaver and my friend ripped it for me. It's great.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'd like to have it as a screensaver too!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I dont mind if someone else made a sequel, it wont stop me from making my game, besides anything is possible in a multidemenson timeline.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I had the same idea to what yours had Spitfire, but in the end, i made my dission that there isn't any connection, mostly already said by Tethys, Soleila and fishy.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ha ha i like it pretty cool photgraphy there
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i was wondering what happened, i havent been around cause right now i dont have internet at my new house, if anyone reads the updates you will see what ive been up too.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'd like to have it as a screensaver too!  :DThat won't be a big deal but it's really about time that you get an own computer, Jade. The file is about 38 MB and sending or downloading it is no problem. You can use it with the Active Media Player, a tool that allows you to play random video files as your screensaver.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I read the announcement and it's really a funny coincidence that I also was lacking of an internet connection during the last days. Anyway, good to hear that your still alive.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
.............whatever...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh, uh...Nice posters you got there.Hey Fargal.  This is off topic, but I would just like to know: what does "mickey" refer to in Brittish slang?  Like if someone says "Are you taking the mickey?"I do have an idea though...I have no idea. I can assure you you'll find at least one 12 year old idiot wearing a baseball cap underneath a hood saying "YOO TAKIN' THA MICK?!" if you say "Hello" to them.And as for the posters...this is my brother's room. c.cCan you guess who it is? Ahem.It looks like you've watched the tape form "The Ring"*phone rings*My mom thought it might be a reference to drugs...hmm...

This is all you get for your preview.There is something strange happening, the Earth is being polluted by the humans and the future is becoming dim for our hero Ecco, who is still within the tides of time. The asterite has not be completly honest with Ecco, and so he is determined to find out just whats going on. When a strange glyph is found deep within the tides of time, Ecco hears that there is another who split the stream of time in two. When Ecco tells the asterite what he heard all it would say is that deep within the tides of time, is himself. Ecco returns to the tides of time only to find that he cant figure out whats going on. In a dream he sees the big dipper, flashing over and over. When he wakes, he finds that what he saw in his dream, leads him to himself. Well there it is, the story is still under heavy construction, so this will probbly be changed as time goes by. If it stays around long enough, maybe even I too will be able to create an actual game over this. I will update this thread frequently to keep you up to date with me and my Ecco story  Yes I know he has one under construction. I have talked alot with him over Ecco and his site on msn messenger.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
well  in the tradtional ecco games there apparenly any humans...save for the Atlantians (unless they were human-like beings)so um...there is your DoTf tie in?Spitfire, why do you have a number in your name?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
You will see how it all ties in togethor in the end. Think of the preview being as small as the halo 2 theatrical trailer. It doesnt explain hardly anything, and for the people that like the newer ecco the dolphin franchise there will be a special suprise for u.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well if you dont know, I am writing a sequel to Ecco the dolphin tides of time,  it will tie up Ecco DOTF and ToT at last. I hope you all enjoy it when its finished. If anyone knows how to create a game, or anyone who knows anyone that can I would greatly appreciate it if you would tell me so I can get this produced. Dont ask Arkonviox as I already know that he cant as he is making his own game.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
ah, OK then... ;)
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
They should also have the Dwarven, Orkish and Entish (those tree PPL) names........
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well like I said, the story will probbably not be the same as it was, I have completly changed it to something that will be more interesting and more intense. This story will probbly not change(if it does it will just be small changes). The new story has a more mysterious touch to it. Well when I develop more into it I will give a preview.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I tend to agree with Soleila here. I dont think DOTF is the sequal to TOT, and like so many other games thwese days, old favourites being remade the whole time, im betting the actual Ecco 3 will b poking up soon enough.

http://www.livejournal.com/community/feminist/1176661.htmlwell here is the link, If you want to kill some brain cells you should read other submissons into the feminist commnity. Some of these gals (and some guys) make past Arkon/Undercaves/COH members have been more sane then some of these girls.I'm supprised they haven't posted "OMG mensual cookie recipies! its good for you and the environment!"Ok so, this complant is about a candy bar who advirtises that they "aren't for girls"which is very bad, mean and stinkypoopoopanted
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well my first thought was "why in the hell would they use an ad campaign like that", but my question was answered by reading some of the more intelligernt comments there.  In any case, it's really stupid to get so upset over a candy bar.  Therer are things that matter much more than that.

noob here! anyway i first played the first ecco the dolphin in kindergarden when i had the chicken pox. i was hooked and i was always begging my mom to go rent the game week after week. it probably took me a couple of days to figure out how to get out of home bay though!  my dad who also liked the game would stay up until 1 with me and we would take turns playing levels. we got up to one of the jurassic levels, but could never get any further. i was set on not use any cheats except for the codes that they give you, so it took my the longest bloody time to beat the game. i didn't actually finish ecco until i was in like 5th grade. my brother, who i am convinced can beat any game, of course was doing laps around me finishing it in less than half a day. i finally completed it in 6th grade. i still to this day get total thrills out of reaching Big Blue or the Astrite. they just have always fascinated me.anywa ToT had already been out for a while. i just never bought it. i think N 64 was around and genesis games were pretty much long gone.well 4 years later when i heard that the ecco franchise was coming back with dotf i had a heart attack! i had to have it the day it came out!! but it was only out on dream cast, and i didnt have one.... when it did come out on PS2 i couldn't find it any where and ended up buying it from blockbuster because they said no one rented it anyway (how sad  :(! ) so i've been playing it for 2 years, and still haven't finished it. to make a long story short my brother erased all of my progress off my memory card (little *&amp;^(&amp;). i was just starting the hatchery on top of it. and TODAY  when i felt like finally starting to play again my brother has to go and slam his fist into our PS2 because he was pissed that i wouldn't use the level select cheat to just blast my way through the game to where i was originally (he also wanted to see me do heart of the foe becuase he is obsessed with beating bosses).  not only did he scratch my cd in this process, some how it also was burned, i guess by the little laser thing? no, it didn't burst into flames, but  there were brun marks embeded into me pride n' joy!but moving on. i recently got the ToT ROM and i have been just fooling around with it. i don't really feel like playing through the whole game. i might just use codes to beat the vortex queen, but then i won't be able to play the level after city of forever. so right now its fun to mess around on. call me crazy but i don't really like the graphics. they just look un-natural for lack of a better word.        
</div>

Welcome here!!!The graphics where awsome when you take a look at them in 1993. Of course the games don't impress people today anymore and there was a special feeling about them that you can't get without this original experience. I know games with the most stupid graphics that I loved and played much more than any other perfect-looking today's game. An example is Maniac Mansion, hahaha.

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
i dunno, i just don't get that same thrill out of playing ToT compared to the first ecco. maybe because i waited so long to actually play ToT all of the graphics of today just threw me off or something like that. whatever the case is it doesn't mean i don't like the franchise as a whole :)

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oy...I dont mind if you dont like the story, spitfire, but dont tell someone "fix that and youll have a good story." Thats just rude.Anyways, I have been working on the second part...but I came to an abrupt end when i saw Arkons post...absolutely shocking. I dont see any point in continuing, yet, as i dont want to post this on any other ecco website....More to come, but i want to see the state of Arkonviox.com first. Thank you guys for your support, and for your suggestions. I hope in the future that i Can continue, and that this ambitious project will be tackled by more then a few of us.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
one more thing, spitfire...if you decide to "take on" the second chapter, notify me first, so we can discuss it. It is still my project, and i want to at least know what your writing so i dont write the same stuff as you..
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Wow, I'm so bad at geography. I guess it's somewhere in Northern Europe.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
shock? Arkon tisk tisk tisk just what are you thinking.... Just as I happen to get my butt back online too....   What about all your work on the new webite?
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well, I don't really speak German, but I use German words when I'm talking...And Lappland is in Finland. You should know it, Santa Claus lives in Lappland!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Aww.....   I'll miss you, Arkon....
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I was attually looking forward to the new web site. I'll miss being here, ect. and i also want to appologize if i have done any stupid things to anyone here.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
what a shame, you had such big dreams and you are an insperation to some of us.Are you going off line totaly like Jason/Backfin?too bad, I wanted to make a site and have you write things for it, if not can you at least e-mail me your collections on the Tides of Time and the tesserict so I can implement them?

</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Man this is so weird.. but I guess the end had to come sometime. Well I'm glad you guys are taking a break and focusing more on your lives, but then again we will all miss you so I'm sad at the same time. I grew up with you guys , and even people who haven't been here as long have grown to love this place like I have.  I wish you guys luck though, and you better keep in touch. Take care guys!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I only had a short appearance here and never truly took part at history. It was a good time and I enjoyed my stay but now it's the moment when I say goodbye. Good luck, guys. I will miss you. The internet never should have been so important for me and I'm leaving this place before it goes offline. You can still find me on COH or instant messengers if you like.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Lappland is the whole northern part of Finland.It's not just a city...And Santa lives in Lappland! If you go to the North pole, there's nothing!But Santa really lives in Lappland. I've met him!  :D
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Ah.It's just that....I never heard of it.   So that's why I had to ask. ._.;
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Oh-no this place will be shut down? Well, to some people here I guess all I can say is good-bye and good luck to whatever you do with your future. I've had a fun time with fellow Ecco fans here, and I am very glad I was able to find this place. Thanks so much for letting me stay as long as I could.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Modu told me about your decision, Arkon.And I wanted to say that, even if I officially left the site, I'm sad...  :( I lived so much good moments here...As I said it some years ago, this community was like a second family to me...It was painful for me to lose it, when everyone I loved left...Noriko, Callyfin, Artreus, Tidesinger...I remember our hilarous discussions about sperm cells on the Dark Seas Chat, our stupid jokes and interesting topics about dolphins...And it hurts to know that everything will disappear...I hope the Darkseas chatroom will keep going, at least...Anyway, I'm feeling bad...
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Yeah, this place is the first forum I ever joined, and I know I'm gonna miss it.  I enjoy the conversations with everyone, from the pointless to the intelligent.  And I liked pretty much everybody here...at least as far as the regulars.At least some of us can still keep in touch.  And I made some friends.  And well it was all worth it.We had a good run anyway.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
It was painful for me to lose it, when everyone I loved left...Noriko, Callyfin, Artreus, Tidesinger...I don't know why Tidy left, But if you want Callyfin you need to hunt her down on LJ.Aretrues left because of a Moudolador reason and I know not of Norkio.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
seeing as how impending doom awaits us, where will you all go? will some of you leave behind the folks you've called friend (i've seen if trust me)will anyone here make their own site? even if not fully Ecco realated?come on answer me!
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I have my own little message board, (which is dead, i dont' know why i just dont' delete it) and i'll still go Caverns of Hope and other fourms (alittle Ecco related)  which i have friends on.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
Well I can't say for sure what I'll have time for or when but ecofans.com will have something eco related on it in the future when I get the chance to get a web host again, it might not be more than eccoserve and the undercaves archives or it could be more I'm not sure at this point but I'll drop a note on Eao's livejournal ecco comunity whenever I have something back up.  I'm never giving up on ecco that for sure.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I'd like to keep in contact with those of you on this site who would call me a friend (don't know who all that would be ^^) but as for myself...I've been playing with the idea of making my own website, I think I'm going to start studying HTML here soon. Of course with school starting up here in a couple weeks I probably won't have much time to do the things I want to.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
yeah its kinda sad to think this is the last time we'll all be together, but id rather quite while im ahead then quite when i have nothing, id hate to close this site down and no one would of been there for the end. i never expected to end like this but my reasons make sense, if im ever gonna make this "dream game" i need to work on it alone, but right now i have a life calling to me and alot of broken dreams left here, until i decide when and if i want to pick up the broken fragments of the past, i need to start exploring the building blocks for a bright future. there was so much i wanted for this community and my life, but i need to leave this place, not cause i hate it but because it hurts me to be here, everytime i visit i think to myself this place could be better this place could have so much more, and i think of all that work required to make that possible. i know i can do it, but what is there left in the ecco community? we all know what we need for this community to continue, we need a new game, and i need to ethier live up to my promise or quit, so we'll see how things turn out, i worked hard on my game idea, and spent many many years learning how to do it, will i do it? i dont know yet, i'm too sad, i blame myself for not accomplishing anything i dreamed for this community, and its time i stopped and looked at this place and myself and decide whats more important?whats more important is i do what makes me happy, and follow the path that calls for me, i have a job to do and thats why im retiring, but we'll all see each other again somewhere, someplace, sometime, i'm sure of it, and it will be then we reconize those feelings and each other, and remember a feeling that was great, and a link to each other that was strong, and then again we'll have to let go.

should anyone here, contact old old contactable menbers like Delphi and any Undercavers? where did people like Dragonboy go to?anway you can "track" some of them on Devientart and Livejoirnal.which is ironic because Arkon wanted to make a script better than both!
</div>

Well I'm gonna still be at DeviantArt.  http://nueva-paz.deviantart.com/  I also have a live journal but I haven't updated it in ages.I joined Gaia a short time ago and I've been hanging out there quite a bit.  Plenty of forum goodness there.  If you're there, look for Kythira.

Arkon, I'd just like to thank you for all those times you listened to me when I was whining about various things. Really, it meant alot to me that you took the time to listen, 'specially to a nobody like me. Good luck on your game, I do hope you can get the chance to finish it. Either way, I hope life treats you well. This website was the only place on the internet where people knew me for who I am, not the characters I portray. It almost felt like family at times. And this was also the only place I was really comfortable sharing my artwork....bigger sites like Deviant and Elfwood, etc, make me uncomfortable. For those of you who I will never speak to again, I'll miss you. It was fun. Anyone else who cares to keep in contact, my email and msn is rocknrollrebel15@hotmail.com.
</div>
<br />
<div id='container'>
I also want to thank you Arkon, for being rough on me sometimes. You helped me attatually to think more when making posts about other peoples artwork, ect. I do hope that your life gets better for you and going well.

I plan to make a little message board much like EccoCodes for my friends. I hope that it will be a way of keeping in touch once college comes around and we all go different directions. Other than that I guess normal life and working towards school goals swimming and softball and sticking around COH for a little longer is what I'll be doing. And, just for the heck of it, here is how I can be contacted if you want to. e-mail fishy_1@hotmail.com
