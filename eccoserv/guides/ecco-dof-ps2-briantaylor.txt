                          ============================
================================================================================

Welcome to my walkthrough for Ecco The Dolphin: Defender Of The Future.  This
guide was written for the Playstation 2 version in mind, but during the creation
of it I have decided to add the control and level information for the Dreamcast
release as well.

Where there are differences between the levels, there will be a short section
prior to the level walkthrough proper, informing the player what the differences
are between the two versions.  If there is no information then the levels are
identical in every way and the level walkthrough will work for either game
version.

The ONLY thing that MIGHT have subtle differences will be the Vitalit guide, as
I haven't played the Dreamcast version of Ecco in over 5 years and do not have a
Dreamcast system that I can get access to in order to check.

If you do find any differences that I haven't mentioned then please e-mail me
using the address at the top of the guide and let me know.

                           0.04          GAME STORY
                          ==========================
================================================================================

At the dawn of the 30th Century, after Five Hundred years of unity and
fellowship, Dolphin and Man set out from the Earth to explore the great unknowns
of space.

But where Man and Dolphin founded a civilisation of peace, others based theirs
on strength, conquest and domination.  Yet even as Man and Dolphin went out from
the earth, the sinister "Foe" cast envious eyes upon it.  For the Earth was a
prize beyond measure, a pristine world to be cherished, or exploited.

But the Earth was not defenseless.  the mighty Guardian - the greatest
creation of Dolphin kind - shielded the Earth with its power.  Undeterred, The
Foe persisted, probing for a moment of weakness they were certain must come.

It was in this time that a Dolphin named Ecco arrived at the Isle of the
Guardian, seeking to learn from the scholars of peace, but destined to become
the only hope and champion of the Earth.

[X] = Cross
[S] = Square
[T] = Triangle
[C] = Circle
LAS = Left Analog Stick
RAS = Right Analog Stick

[X] = Swim Forward
Pump to gain speed then hold down once at full speed.

[C] = Charge
From a static position this will arch Ecco up and shoot him forward.
From a moving position it will give Ecco a quick boost of speed.

[S] = Sonar
Use this to talk to other Dolphins, Whales, The Guardian & Info Glyphs
throughout the game.  Press and hold to bring up your Sonar Map.

[T] = Change Camera
This will switch the camera from a 3rd person perspective to a fixed camera so
that you can turn Ecco around to face you.  Not very useful to be honest.

L1 = Rolls Ecco to the left

R1 = Rolls Ecco to the right

L2 = Moves the camera to a side view of Ecco's left side.  Useful for levels
     like Four Ways Of Mystery & Hatchery.

R2 = Moves the camera to a side view of Ecco's right side.  Useful for levels
     like Four Ways Of Mystery & Hatchery.

L2 & R2 = Moves the camera in front of Ecco so that you can see behind you.
          Highly useful for Perils Of The Coral Reef & Anguish Of Dearth.

L3 = Next Objective
This is supposed to point you in the direction of the next thing you need to do,
although I find this more of an annoyance then a help.

R3 = Manual Correct
If you get a bit confused which way is up, press R3 to make Ecco auto correct to
a level and straight position.

SELECT = Compass
This is supposed to show you when Vitalits, glyphs or enemies are nearby, but it
is too small to use properly so it is better to have it left off.

START = Pauses the game and allows you access to Ecco's inventory.

LAS: -
Backwards:  Ecco will point upwards.
Forwards:   Ecco will point downwards.
Left:       Ecco will turn left.
Right:      Ecco will turn right.

RAS: -
Backwards: While moving performs a Quick Stop.
Backwards: While stationary will make Ecco swim backwards.
Left:      180 Turn Left.
Right:     180 Turn Right.
Forward:   While moving will perform a special spin.  Sometimes useful for
           avoiding sharks but I've not used it.

* please note that UP, DOWN, LEFT & RIGHT refer to the Analog Stick, NOT the D-
Pad.

D-Pad = Change Camera
By quickly pressing in any direction, the camera following Ecco will change from
a static camera that keeps the camera directly behind Ecco to a floating camera
that has a delay before it follows Ecco, almost like it is being towed on a long
piece of string.  If you press and hold any direction of the D-Pad, then the
camera will become 'airborne' and float above the surface of the water.  The
only level that I can really see any use for this is Hanging Waters as you can
get a more general view of your surroundings if you are having trouble making
the larger jumps in the level.

AS = Control Ecco
The Analog Stick controls the movement of our intrepid hero.

L Trigger = Left Side View
Moves the camera to a side view of Ecco's left side.  If you are in floating or
airborne camera views then Ecco will roll instead.

R Trigger = Right Side View
Moves the camera to a side view of Ecco's right side.  If you are in floating or
airborne camera views then Ecco will roll instead.

L + R Triggers = Rear View
Moves the camera in front of Ecco so that you can see behind you.

START = Pause Game
Use this to bring up your in-game menu system.  If you press X & Y together then
the menu system will disappear from the screen.  Useful if you want to do some
screen captures of certain levels or items.  Press X & Y again to replace the
menu screen.

**Ecco's controls are similar to a flight sim, as in up = down and down = up**

                              =====================

Each of Ecco's five abilities have to be discovered during the game, and the
Star shaped Glyphs are the key to unlocking them.  If you see a Star Glyph then
you need to collect it.  Each symbol relates to a different gift.


                            ========================
                             DIAMOND ABILITY GLYPHS
                            ========================

These Glyphs each have symbols that relate to the star Glyphs that you collect.
These will enable Ecco to use the power that they contain.  The powers are all
temporary and vary in duration, so do not squander them when you have them.


                                 ==============
                                  CLEAR GLYPHS
                                 ==============

These large, clear glyphs are pieces of the Guardian that help guide you through
the game, sometimes with a cryptic clue.


                                ===============
                                 VISION GLYPHS
                                ===============

These are a unique feature to the PS2 version.  If you sonar one of these purple
Glyphs you will see a short 'clue' movie giving you additional help if you need
it.


                                   ==========
                                    VITALITS
                                   ==========

These are very small shards of the Guardian that assist Ecco in his quest. For
each Vitalit that you collect your energy bar will grow slightly, allowing you
to have slightly more energy available to you when you eat fish.  A PS2 bonus is
that for each level where you collect ALL the Vitalits for that level, a piece
of concept artwork will be revealed in the Gallery.

                      ===================================

Turtles now trust and follow your lead.  They follow the song one by one in a
line.  Frightened by charged they shyly sink downward, but this song renews
their trust in you at once.

Sharks will be stunned with the sound of your sonar.  For the briefest of
instances they will not attack, & those so confused may head-on be battled.

                        FISH (Perils Of The Coral Reef)
                       =================================

Small schools of fish will surround you and follow you.  Some are just food that
heal wounds and infection.  Some fish glow like torches in darkness, and red
fishes of poison repel enemy attentions, but know that all fish have a SLOW,
STEADY PACE.

                          ============================

The Great Manta Ray will obey your decree.  It will swim where you aim with your
sonar command.  Stingrays will betray their places, and those plain in sight
will flee from your song.

                      ===================================

Augments the strength of your swim and your charges.  You can roll rocks around,
split some boulders in two, reach higher heights and conquer swift currents.
The strength of your charges not an enemy can survive.

Doubles the length of your stay underwater.  Replenishes your air with an extra
reserve, but the air you inhale will not lengthen this magic.  As you run out of
breath this power is gone.

                 SONAR (Perils Of The Coral Reef [The Return])
                ===============================================

Amplifies sonar to lethal proportions.  Power of sonar is a gift brief in time.
Useful it is against enemies but not allies, & can shatter some rocks to reveal
paths and gifts.

                            =======================

Replenishes health and expands your stamina.  Your resistance to harm is
extended for now.  The eating of fish will not regain it; the endurance you gain
is just for a while.


                             =====================
                              STEALTH (Up & Down)
                             =====================

It conceals your existence by veiling your substance.  Enemies will not sense
your invisible presence, but stealth does not work if your acts are too bold.

outsiders.  You will need to gain the trust of each breed of dolphin in a
specific way to prove yourself to them.
================================================================================

================================================================================
OUTCAST / RESISTANCE DOLPHINS
UNIQUE FEATURES: Green skinned and they have gills.
FIRST SEEN: Anguish Of Dearth.

These dolphins regard Ecco as an "air breather".  These dolphins no longer

================================================================================

================================================================================
HUMPBACK WHALES
UNIQUE FEATURES: BIG!!!.
FIRST SEEN:      Aquamarine Bay.

The Humpback whales can be of great help to Ecco on two separate occasions.
Don't dismiss what they have to tell you.
================================================================================

================================================================================
TURTLES
UNIQUE FEATURE: Swimming doorstops.
FIRST SEEN:     Aquamarine Bay.

You can get these gentle giants to follow you at a later stage in the game.
Swimming into them or nudging them from above makes them retract into their
shells but you can sing to them to make them reappear, or else they will do it
themselves after a predetermined amount of time.  You will need one of these to
complete a task mid-way through the game.
================================================================================

================================================================================
GIANT MANTA RAY
UNIQUE FEATURE: Likes playing with eels.
FIRST SEEN:     Four Ways Of Mystery.

The Giant Manta Ray is another one of those friends that, while not interacting
with Ecco directly actually proves the most useful.  You will need one of these
rays during the first 'world' of the game.

================================================================================
THE GUARDIAN (in all it's various forms)
UNIQUE FEATURES: Living Crystal.
FIRST SEEN:      Prolouge movie introduction.

The Guardian is a creation of dolphin intelligence, and is the best defence that
Earth has against The Foe.  Throughout the game you will see Glyphs (pieces of
the guardian) that will provide you with information or clues regarding a
current or future task that you will need to complete.

================================================================================
COMMON SHARKS
UNIQUE FEATURES: N/A
FIRST SEEN:      Aquamarine Bay.

These sharks present little threat in a one-on-one match, but can prove deadly
in a group situation.  A single common shark will take 3 hits to kill using
normal strength and only 1 hit to kill using Power Of Vigour.
================================================================================

================================================================================
HAMMERHEAD SHARKS
UNIQUE FEATURES: 'Hammer' style shaped head, stronger then 'common' sharks.
FIRST SEEN:      Perils Of The Coral Reef.

These sharks only appear during the 'Isle Of Tranquility' levels.  A single
Hammerhead Shark require 5 hits to kill under normal strength, or 2 hits if
using Power Of Vigour.  It's very rare to see these sharks swimming alone, and
you will normally find them in groups of two or more.  They may also be swimming
with a small group of 'Common' sharks as well.
================================================================================

================================================================================
TIGER SHARKS
UNIQUE FEATURES: Mottled white/grey in colour.  Very fast.
FIRST SEEN:      Blades In Motion.

These are much quicker and more aggressive then both of the previous sharks
combined.  Although they are highly aggressive, it is possible to defeat them
with little or no harm befalling Ecco.  A single Tiger Shark requires 3 hits to
destroy it, or 2 hits if using Power Of Vigour.
================================================================================

================================================================================
PIRHANA FISH
UNIQUE FEATURES: Visious.
FIRST SEEN:      Perils Of The Coral Reef.

The little blighters will jump right onto Ecco if you do not protect yourself.
The ONLY means of defence against them is to surround Ecco with a school of
either red fish or the stone coloured ones that cure Man-O-War Jellyfish stings,
as no creature likes eating either type of fish.
================================================================================

================================================================================
MEMBRANE JELLYFISH
UNIQUE FEATURES: Almost impossible to see until you swim into them.
FIRST SEEN:      Perils Of The Coral Reef

As the features line states, these are almost invisible.  they are white in
colour, but they have almost no physical mass, which is what accounts for their
invisibility.  They can be defeated by charging them head on.
================================================================================

================================================================================
MAN-O-WAR JELLYFISH
UNIQUE FEATURES: Only jellyfish that can poison Ecco
FIRST SEEN:      Perils Of The Coral Reef

These jellyfish are the most harmful to Ecco.  They are made up of a pink-purple
inner body and an outer pale white dome.  They have tendrils hanging from
beneath them that can deliver a *sometimes* fatal sting to Ecco.  If you get
stung then Ecco's energy bar will turn purple and his movements will be very
sluggish.  there is usually a school of stone coloured fish nearby that can cure
the effect of the sting, but do not eat them once you are cured as they will
reduce your remaining energy.  You can defeat them with a head on charge or
Power Of Sonar attack.
================================================================================

================================================================================
BLUE JELLYFISH
UNIQUE FEATURES: Large and slow moving
FIRST SEEN:      Trial Without Error

This type deliver a strong punch of sting to Ecco when they are touched.  Unlike
the membrane type, you can at least see these from a distance.  They are blue in
colour and have long tendrils hanging down from the middle of their bodies.  Not
the most fatal jellyfish in the group, but still potent enough to deliver a
killing blow to Ecco if you are low on energy.  Just avoid them at all costs.
================================================================================

================================================================================
STINGRAYS
UNIQUE FEATURES: Hide under the floor.
FIRST SEEN:      Trial Without Error.

Stingrays are more of an annoyance then a real threat.  If you swim too close
to one it will rise out from under the sandy floor of the level and deal you a
small electric shock before returning to the sand.  It is not possible to kill
them, although it is possible to make them reveal themselves by sonaring them
from above.
================================================================================

================================================================================
WATER SCORPIONS
UNIQUE FEATURES: Able to walk on any surface, as well as swim.
FIRST SEEN:      Perpetual Fluidity.

Once again, an enemy that is more annoying then a real threat.  On their own
they pose no real trouble but in a large enough group they can deal Ecco a fair
whack of damage.  These creatures can climb any surface, and also they can swim.
Once locked onto Ecco they will start pinching.  Swift movement is the only way
to shake them off.  They can be destroyed by charging them head on, and they
will disintegrate.  You can also use Power OF Sonar to destroy them from a
distance.
================================================================================

================================================================================
COMMON EEL
UNIQUE FEATURES: Hides in crevices.
FIRST SEEN:      Four Ways Of Mystery.

These little snappers enjoy nothing better then giving Ecco a love-bite when he
swims past.  They hide in small holes in the walls of the levels, and just when
you think there is nothing near you, SNAP!, they've nipped you.  No way to
destroy them, just avoid them if possible.
================================================================================

================================================================================
ELECTRIC EEL
UNIQUE FEATURES: Can power their own homes.
FIRST SEEN:      Blades In Motion.

Once again, not an enemy that you can destroy.  If you swim within their range
they will deal you a sharp electric jolt that delivers a minor amount of damage.
Just avoid them where possible, or stay out of their range at least.
================================================================================

================================================================================
CLAN DOLPHINS
UNIQUE FEATURES: Agressive nature and enlarged skeletal spines running down
                 their backs.
FIRST SEEN:      Entrapment.

These dolphins are the creation of The foe's interference of the timeline.  They
have enlarged teeth that jut out over their jawbone and they have spines that
run down their backs.  These dolphins vary in size and colour, being either
yellow or black.

================================================================================
THE FOE
UNIQUE FEATURES: Has multiple forms.
FIRST SEEN:      Atlantis Lost (as 3D images).

The Foe (the MAIN bad guy within the game) is a collective name for at least
FIVE different enemies.  The list is Foe Shark, Foe Rhino Shark, Foe Snake, Foe
Bat & and the  almighty Foe Queen.  Out of these five, the ONLY one that you can
kill (and it stays dead) is the Foe Bat.  It requires 3 consecutive hits with a
Power Of Sonar blast.  If your Power Of Sonar expires then you will need to
start the 3 count all over again.  The Foe Snake can be stunned using the Power
Of Sonar for a short time, and the two Foe Sharks can be destroyed, but on the
Dreamcast version they will re-spawn after a set period of time.
================================================================================

================================================================================

                        ================================
================================================================================

For five hundred years, dolphins and humans had lived together in unity,
harmony, and fellowship.  Together, they set out to explore the great unknown.
Peace and friendship were offered to all who would welcome it.  But there were
forces for whom aggression was the highest calling.  Creatures known only as
'The Foe' regarded the Earth with envious eyes, for humans and dolphins were
their hated enemy.  From time beyond memory the Foe had gone undefeated.  They
devoured, dominated and annihilated all in their path.

But humans and dolphins brought their age of conquest to an end.  Driven to the
brink of defeat, The Foe plotted vengeance on Earth.  But the few caretaker
dolphins who remained behind were not defenseless.  Protected by their greatest
creation, the Guardian shielded them with its immense power.  Undeterred, the
Foe persisted seeking a moment of weakness. [And] In this time of crisis lived a
young dolphin named Ecco.  He was destined to become the only hope for humans
and dolphins... [Ecco] Defender of Earth's future.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
Learn from the 'Teacher', free the baby whale from a rockslide, win 'Fish Fetch'
================================================================================

When the level starts, talk to the 'Teacher' until you have learned everything
he knows.  After that, swim to the group of three dolphins.  One of them will be
the 'Coach', who will inform you that they are playing a game of 'Fish Fetch'.
He will ask you to collect a fish that is coloured either Yellow, Red or Purple,
and return it to him.  After playing the game once, use your sonar map to locate
the whales.  Talk to the mother Whale, then return to the area where the
'Teacher' is.  A cut-scene will take over and show The Foe breaking through the
Guardian's shield, and cracking the Guardian itself.  This will unleash an
earthquake that will bury the gate back towards Atlantis.

After this has finished, relocate the whales on your map and swim back to the
mother.  You will notice the baby has gone.  The mother will ask you to help
find her baby.  If you turn so that you are facing the Whale sideways on, with
her head pointing left, and then turn around 180 degrees.  Swim towards the
wall, then follow the wall to the left, so that the wall is on your right hand
side, you will come across a rock fall with a green rock at the bottom of it,
with the baby Whale behind it.  Swim inside the rock fall and talk to the baby,
then return to the area with the 'Coach'.  Just as you get near the area the two
'Players' will swim over to you and line up beside you.

Go back to the baby Whale and guide all three dolphins towards the
aforementioned green rock at the base of the rock fall.  A cut-scene will show
Ecco and the 'Players' moving the rock, which will shift the larger rocks out of
the way and allow the baby Whale to escape.  Once this sequence has finished and
the baby has returned to its mother, go and talk to the mother and she will ask
you to go towards the waterfall.  Once you go towards the waterfall the game
will take over and show the mother Whale swimming over and blocking the current
of the waterfall, allowing Ecco to leave and gain access to Perils Of The Coral
Reef.

***For the DREAMCAST version you will start in the alcove with the 'Racing
Dolphins'.  You need to go out of the alcove and turn left to find the 'Shark
Fighting Dolphin' that is the start position of the PS2 version.***

From your start position go to your left and follow the corridor.  When you see
a gap in the wall on your right, go through it and talk to the two Racing
Dolphins.  They will inform you of how to join them in a race.  After winning
the race, go back to where you started and you have to jump over the lowest part
of the wall to enter the second section of this level.  If you haven't noticed
already, you now have your first enemies in the form of regular sharks.  They
require three hits to kill them (a 'hit' is when you charge them and they flash
red and 'moan').  After jumping over the wall and swimming past the group of
sharks, the game will take control of Ecco as a small dolphin swims up and asks
you to help save his turtle friend from the sharks behind you.

After you have killed them (three in total), the game will take control again as
the small dolphin swims up and bestows the Turtle Song on you, as well as
mentioning about his brother being a better fighter then you.  Go back to the
dolphin that spoke to you at the start and talk to him again.  He will tell you
to lead him to his brother and he will teach you a song.  Jump back over the
wall to the small dolphin and you will enter another section of loss of control
as the young dolphins brother gives you the Shark Song.  This will stun and
confuse a shark for a few seconds so you can hit them head on with no damage.
After this carry on into the rest of the level and follow the wall on the right.
This will lead you into a section with a dolphin chasing a LARGE fish.

If you catch this fish, the Dolphin chasing it will teach you the Fish Song,
which allows you to lead a school of fish.  After this, go out into the next
main chamber of the level by going through the gap in the wall and follow the
wall on the left until you come to a tunnel entrance with jellyfish at the start
of it.  Nearby on the floor is a school of yellow fish.  Guess what! The tunnel
has no lights and the fish glow in the dark (coincidence!).  Make sure you
recharge your air meter (you'll need it) and then sing to this school of yellow
fish to make them follow you.  Once you are in the tunnel, take your time.  Your
air will last longer then you think, and if you go too fast you will lose the
fish, as they can't travel very fast.  This tunnel will lead you to the GWS
pool.

Once in the pool, you need to attract the attention of the GWS, so do your best
to tick him off in any fashion possible.  To kill him you have to FIRST get him
stuck in the LOWER of the two holes in the central column of rock in the pool.
Once stuck you can collect the Vigour Star Glyph from his mouth. This will give
you the ability to use the Power of Vigour that is stored in the higher of the
two holes.

***There is another tunnel that leads you to the GWS pool, which has red fish
near it.  If you sing to these red fish (don't eat them, they are bad for you),
they will protect you from the piranha fish that are in this LIT and SHORTER
tunnel***

There are various methods for killing the GWS, but make sure that you have
collected the Vigour Glyph before you try to attack him.  You can get him stuck
in the hole, or swim behind him and hit him.  Whatever works for you!  After
killing the GWS, exit the area by going through the tunnel that is NEXT to the
dark tunnel.  This will bring you out ALMOST back at your original start point.
Just follow the corridor to the other end and you will remember where you are.

After re-tracing your steps back to the Fish Song Dolphin, go through the gap in
the left side of the wall and this time follow the wall round to the right and
you will see an area where there is a low wall, this is the exit to the level.
Go through it and swim along the corridor, avoiding or killing the sharks.  When
you get to the end there will be a strong current that is stopping you exiting
the level.  Nearby is another Vigour Glyph (what a helpful Guardian, leaving
these things in just the right place for you), which you will need to collect in
order to defeat the current and swim through the light into Trial Without Error.

                      ===================================
                       1.04          TRIAL WITHOUT ERROR
                      ===================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
         Find & rescue the scared dolphin, Find three dolphin children
                            Locate the Great Octopus
================================================================================

From your start position, travel down the corridor until it opens up, and then
stay on the left-hand sidewall.  You will see a circle of stone columns, of
which one will have a slightly different coloured peak to it.  Below this circle
of stone is the Great Octopus, and the first exit point of the level.
While you are in this first reef, kill all the sharks you find in it.  If you
find the archway of rock in the middle of this area, collect the Vigour Glyph
in it then the sharks only require one hit to kill them.  Go and speak to the
Mother Dolphin swimming in the centre.  She will ask you to find her children
and she will tell you a riddle in return.

Once you have spoken to her, go through the tunnel with reeds hanging over the
entrance, you will find one of the children in there but BE WARNED, the tunnel
is quite dark and the Dolphin is quite hard to spot.  If you stay fairly near to
the ground and stick to the left hand side you should find him easy enough.
After finding him go back the way you came and once you are back in the main
area, look for a VERY LARGE rock leaning against one of the walls, so that there
is a gap between the rock and the wall.  The second Dolphin is there.  Once you
Sonar him he will demand that you chase him to return him, so swim after him and
touch him with your nose.  If he makes it back to his hiding place before you
get him you will have to go through it again until you catch him.

Go back to the Circle of Stone and as you face the wall of the level with the
circle between you and the wall, turn right and swim through the opening into
another section with HAMMERHEAD sharks.  These require 5 hits each (or two with
the Vigour Glyph).  Once you have killed the sharks you will locate the third
Dolphin roughly in one of the small alcoves where there are two pieces of
vertical coral.  He will ask that you lead him back to his mother, so do so.
Once all three children have been returned to her, talk to her again.  She will
give you a riddle to solve.  Once you've read the riddle (and written it down if
you want to), travel through the dark tunnel that you found the Dolphin child
in, into the 'Scared Dolphin' section.  BEWARE, there are approx 6 sharks in
this section, so watch what you do as they gang up on you VERY fast.

If you swim in a straight line from the tunnel exit you will see an opening in
the walls.  This is where the scared Dolphin is, and the sharks will not follow
you into this area.  Swim to the back wall, and behind a small section of rock
near the surface is another Vigour Glyph, so you can augment your strength to
fight the sharks in the other area.  After you have killed all the sharks, go
back to the Scared Dolphin and speak to him.  He will thank you for allowing him
to leave and will ask that you meet him back at the Circle of Stone.  He takes
his time getting back there; so don't panic if he isn't there when you get back.
If you do beat him back, collect the Vigour Glyph from the stone archway and
swim over to the Circle of Stone.

Remember the one that has a different coloured tip to it.  Line yourself up so
you are facing it from the outside and charge it.  The section of rock will fall
into the sand below and open up the lower area.  Once the dolphin has caught up
with you, speak to him and he will be curious of what is below the sand.  Lead
him down below the sand and into the lower chamber itself.  Once you get to the
bottom (avoiding the Giant Octopus), talk to him again and he will tell you
about how he thought the Giant Octopus was a myth and legend.  After this he
will swim towards the Octopus and get caught.  While he is caught, swim
underneath the Octopus' tentacles and down the tunnel into Four Ways Of Mystery.

                       1.05          FOUR WAYS OF MYSTERY
                      ====================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
   Locate the Recluse Dolphin, Distract the Giant Eel with a Giant Manta Ray
================================================================================

***The large Crystal columns that are found in the tunnels will replenish your
air as long as they have a dancing light inside them.  Any Oysters that you
find in the level will replenish your health.  To release these goodies, simply
sonar the item in question.  The crystals will release the light and it
will travel over Ecco to restore his air, and the Oysters will open up to reveal
a Pearl.  Collect the pearl and Ecco's health will be restored.***

This level takes time & patience.  Try to rush it and you will most likely end
up in a wrong tunnel with no idea where to go.  From your start position,
travel into the central chamber and collect the Air Star Glyph.  This will give
you the ability to use the Air Glyphs which will extend you air supply,
and for this level you need as much air as you can get.  After collecting the
Air Star Glyph, turn so that you are facing a purple Guardian Glyph and swim
towards and past it until you see the cavern wall.  Along that section of wall
will be a tunnel with a small Eel hiding in the top of the tunnel entrance.

UNLESS YOU ARE COLLECTING VITALITS THIS TUNNEL HAS NO USE TO YOU!  With that
tunnel facing you, turn 90 degrees to your right and carry on swimming along
that sidewall (keep an eye on that air meter) until you see a section of the
wall turn light brown and looks like it is made of old brickwork.  It is high up
on the wall, much higher then the first tunnel, and has Sea Anemones in the
entrance.  You can stun these into retracting by sonaring them.  A small way
down this tunnel is an Air Glyph (YAY!), which will refill your air supply and
double its length from a full position as well.  After collecting the Glyph
continue into the tunnel until you reach a Purple Crystal Column.  From here
you can go left, right or ahead.

In the right hand tunnel is a Power Sonar Glyph, which you will need on your
return (Oh yes, you will come back here later in the game).  The left hand
tunnel contains the Recluse Dolphin.  If you travel all the way to the end of
the tunnel, ignoring the left hand turn about half way down the tunnel you will
enter an area with the Recluse Dolphin who will teach you The Ray Song if you go
back to the main area of the level and bring him the LARGE Blue & Yellow Fish.
The forward tunnel is just a dead end, but it has an air current to restore your
air if you are running low and have already used the Crystal restore.  Once you
have the Ray Song, exit this section of tunnels as quickly as possible and go
back into the central chamber.

Head towards the tunnel where you started and when you are looking towards your
start point, turn left 90 degrees and follow this wall until you find a very low
tunnel entrance.  This is called the 'Red Tunnel', as it has a Red Crystal
Column in it (remember the purple one?).  Once you reach the Red Crystal Column
you can go ahead or left.  The left tunnel serves no purpose except to waste
your time and air, both of which are precious in this level.  If you go straight
on down the forward tunnel you will come to a pool with sharks in it and a LARGE
MANTA RAY (you need him in a minute).  Kill the sharks.  Replace any energy you
may have lost in the fighting and collect the Air Glyph (helpful Guardian
again!) that is in the pool.

Make sure that you are facing the tunnel and the Manta Ray is between you and
the tunnel.  If you sonar the Manta Ray he will swim towards the tunnel, and
start swimming down the tunnel.  Stay behind him and keep sonaring him until you
exit the tunnel.  Once you exit you need to aim the Ray about 45 degrees to the
right of the tunnel you just came out of, as this puts him swimming towards the
Giant Eel in the roof that would usually eat Ecco and end this fun rather early.
If you're still not quite sure where to aim him, just look for a floor-to-
ceiling column of rock.  The Giant Eel is hiding behind this.  Make the Ray swim
towards this area and as soon as you see the Eel dive out of the roof, CHARGE
like mad past him and into the tunnel beyond.

Think that's it?  OH BOY, ARE YOU WRONG.  We can't let all these fun and games
end quite so quickly, can we!  Head down the tunnel (beware, its LONG) until you
get to a 'collar' of rock similar to the one that the Air Glyph was in.  Beyond
this is a small air column that you can refresh your air with.  Just beyond this
you will see another tunnel, but it will have a strong current, which will stop
you progressing.  OH NO, no Vigour Glyph, what do we do!  Never fear, here is
the answer.  The rocks above this tunnel are loose, and if you nudge one it will
fall down the tunnel and block the current BUT you have to follow the rock down,
as it will not block the current permanently.  Once you are past this the tunnel
will split into two.

The right hand tunnel has the fish that cure jellyfish stings, so if you do get
stung here, go right and heal yourself.  The left tunnel will lead to a four-way
junction with a VERY BIG Blue Crystal Column in the middle of it.  The ONLY
tunnel of importance here is the right hand one.  If you travel down this tunnel
a short way it will split into two.  The right hand side has an Oyster if you
need to replace Ecco's energy.  If you don't need to head to the right then take
the left hand fork and swim like hell as from this point on it is a straight
race between you and Ecco's lung capacity.  Keep travelling down the tunnel,
ignoring any other turns, as they are of no importance to you whatsoever.
Eventually, after what seem like miles of tunnels, you will see another rock
collar (remember them?), which signifies the end of the level.  Travel through
it and keep swimming until a cut-scene takes over and shows Ecco swimming
upwards and back to Perils Of The Coral Reef (Nope, I'm not kidding).

                            Learn the Power of Sonar
================================================================================

You will start facing the ceiling, so it may take a second or two to get your
bearings.  In the floor will be the tunnel that you just used to exit Four
Ways Of Mystery.  In this section of Perils... you will be on the other side of
a coral wall that previously you would have been unable to swim through.
If you swim around in this area you will find a Sonar Star Glyph and a Sonar
Glyph.

Collect the Sonar Star Glyph and then the Sonar Glyph.  Once you have
done so you will see a large wall of coral, and a large wall of rock next to
each other.  Sonar the rock wall and it will collapse, allowing you to exit.
After you have swum out of the tunnel you need to get out of the level as quick
as possible as returning to this level was only for the Sonar Star Glyph,
nothing more.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                        Reveal exit point for Up & Down
================================================================================

You start in the same place as the previous visit to this level, so you should
have a fairly good understanding of its layout.  Swim to the area where the
Hammerhead sharks are and if you notice there is another corridor leading off
from this, which you need to travel down now.  Keep following the corridor
until you come to what looks like a rock overhang with stone 'teeth'.  This is
the exit to Up & Down, but first you need to collect a few things to reveal
it.

If you head past this overhang you will come to a section of the level that
opens up and has a path leading to the right.  You need to go down there AFTER
you collect the Strength Glyph that is under a small rock structure on the left
hand side.  Once you collect the Glyph head to the right hand section and go
past the blue jellyfish and collect the Sonar Glyph.  Once you have this Sonar
Glyph head back to the stone overhang and line yourself up with the 'mouth' of
it so you are facing the jellyfish.  Sonar the wall until it breaks away and
falls into the mouth.  If you now travel into the mouth you will find a light,
which signifies the end of this level and onto Up & Down.

[N.B.]
If you want to collect the 5th Vitalit from Four Ways Of Mystery, then go back
to the Great Octopus and re-enter the Four Ways Of Mystery level.  Once in the
level go and re-locate the Power Sonar Glyph (remember where that is?).  Once
you have the Glyph head into the central chamber to where you found the Air
Star Glyph originally.  If you look up in the roof you will see several rocks
jutting out of the roof.  If you sonar them one of them gives way to reveal
another section of the level which contains the 5th Vitalit, as well as Air &
Energy Glyphs.  Once you have collected the Vitalit you may just exit the
level by choosing exit from the pause menu, then moving onto Up & Down via the
Level Select on the main options screen of the game).

                      ====================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                 Collect the five Vitalits hidden in the level
================================================================================

This level has no bearing on the storyline of the main game.  Contained within
the level though are five more Vitalits.  It is based on the levels from the
original Ecco The Dolphin from the Sega Megadrive / Genesis console.

PS2 players can only use the following info once they have completed the entire
game.  Dreamcast players can just follow the instructions below.

To gain access you have to start the Up & Down level, and on the floor of the
main chamber will be a large ball of rock.  If you push this into the chamber
with an air current coming from the floor, and down into the hole.

Follow the rock down past the air current and go to the stone circle in the
floor with the four posts at each corner.  Sonar each of the four glowing items
in the posts, but do it quickly as you need to have hit all four before the
first one stops moving.  If you get all four hit in time the floor beneath Ecco
will open up and you can swim down into the level.

Once you have accessed this level once from Up & Down you can simply enter the
level from the level select screen instead.

                     =======================================
                      LEVEL WALKTHROUGH / VITALIT POSITIONS
                     =======================================

Follow the tunnel from your start position until you come to a small open area.
Below you will be a tunnel with a current coming from it that will prevent you
going further.  On the floor, next to the tunnel opening will be some rocks, and
if you nudge the one nearest the edge it will fall down into the tunnel.  Follow
the rock down until you come to a right hand turn, and take it.  Move down this
tunnel and you will find an air pocket above you and once you reach the end of
the tunnel, follow it down.  This will bring you to a crossroads.  If you turn
left you will find chamber 1 and if you follow the crossroads to the right you
will find another air refill in the first crossroads and the first Vitalit in
the bottom of the second crossroad.

Head down from the first crossroads and you will see another right hand turn on
your way down, and further down will be another crossroads.  The left tunnel of
the crossroads takes you to chamber 2, and the right tunnel will lead you to the
second Vitalit and another air pocket.  If you head back to that right hand
tunnel and follow it, you will end up in chamber 3, which has a large rock in
your way that you will need to jump over in order to find a Power Sonar.  After
you collect it, head into the tunnel to your right and break the rock to find
the third Vitalit behind it.  Stick around in this area until your Power Sonar
expires then refill it and jump back over the wall and follow the tunnels back
to chamber 2 and break open the large rock on the floor to reveal the fourth
Vitalit.

Retrace your path to regain your Power sonar again then make a hasty backtrack
to chamber 1 and break open the rock in this area to find another (and far more
useful) Power Sonar.  Collect this Glyph and head back to the area where your
start tunnel is.  To the right of your start position will be another tunnel
with a rock blocking your way.  Use your Power Sonar to break the rock and
collect the fifth Vitalit then head back to your start position to depart the
level and return to Up & down.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                 Collect the five Vitalits hidden in the level
================================================================================

This level has no bearing on the storyline of the main game.  Contained within
the level though are five more Vitalits.  This level offers more of a challenge
as it requires you to firstly find 5 pink gems (like the ones used to activate
the jump ring), and then take them through a stone ring to reveal the second
part of the level where the Vitalits are.  It is based on the levels from the
original Ecco The Dolphin from the Sega Megadrive / Genesis console.

PS2 players can only use the following info after they have completed the entire
game.  Dreamcast players can just follow the instructions below.

To gain access you need to get to the top pool of the Up & Down level.  Once
there you will see a yellow ring of a similar design to the ones in Atlantis
Lost.  There will be five crystals in that top pool, 3 IN the pool & 2 above the
surface, which you need to be taken through the ring in order to activate it.
After activation there will be a cut-scene showing a rainbow leaping over the
side of a wall.  You need to jump through the ring in the same direction as the
rainbow.  This will place you into another pool and the entrance to this level.

Once you have accessed this level once from Up & Down you can simply enter the
level from the level select screen instead.

                     =======================================
                      LEVEL WALKTHROUGH / VITALIT POSITIONS
                     =======================================

First things first, you need to unlock the lower portion of this level to gain
access to the five Vitalits contained in this level.  Head forward from your
start position and take the first tunnel upwards to find a Power Sonar and an
air pocket.  After you have got the Power Sonar then keep swimming to your left
and destroy the rock blocking your path.  You will come to a stone ring, beyond
which is the access point to the lower tunnels of this level, as well as a
'bubbler' where you can replace your air supply.  Just above the stone collar is
a tunnel which leads into the first part of this level.

Follow the tunnel up until you get to an area with a fast flowing current which
is heading upwards.  If you follow this current and take the 4th turning to the
right, then head up then right you will find the first gem.  Retrace your steps
by swimming against the current and take the gem to the stone collar.  That's
the first one, now lets find the other four.  If you go back to the current and
follow it round until it goes right, then take the 2nd tunnel down then right,
down, right again and up.  This will put you in touch with gem number two.  Once
again, backtrack on your route and take this gem to the collar.  Only three more
to go now.

For number three, we are going to swim against the current as it is a quicker
route.  Go back to the current and swim all the way to the furthest point, then
head up and take the 2nd tunnel to the left.  Once you have taken this turn,
head down, left, up, left and up again to find number three.  Go back the way
you came to drop off gem three in the collar.  For number four, head the way you
would go for the first gem, but take the first right tunnel once you are facing
upwards.  From here you need to go up, right, 3rd down and then left to locate
number four.  Go back the way you came and get rid of this gem.  Only one more
to find now.

Head the same way as if you were going to the number four gem again, but instead
of taking the final left hand tunnel head downwards and take the right hand
tunnel to locate a Power Sonar Glyph, then head up and go into the tunnel facing
up and take the left hand tunnel at the top, break through the rock blocking
your path and Power Sonar the rock in this small chamber to locate the fifth
gem.  Return this to the collar and you will see a small light float from the
collar and into the floor.  If you move down to the floor the doorway will open.

Before you jump headlong into the second half, recharge that air meter first.
Ok, are you ready to tackle the deepest portions of this level?  You are!  Good.

Head through the doorway and into the diagonal tunnel beyond.  When the tunnel
splits, follow it to the right and take the first downward tunnel, then take the
first right and head down to find the first Vitalit.  From this location you
need to head up, left, down, left and down again.  You will see a right hand
tunnel off to the side which has the second Vitalit.  From Vitalit number 2,
head back into the main tunnel and continue downwards to the lowest point to
find Vitalit 3.

Here's where things get a bit tricky to describe, but I shall try my best not to
loose you in here.  From the location of Vitalit 3 you need to head back up,
left, up and take the first right, first up, right, down, right, then go up and
take the 3rd right tunnel.  Go all the way to the end and go up to locate an air
pocket, then go back to the junction before it and head down to find a Power
Sonar.  From here head up, left, down and take the first right and break the
rock blocking your path then head up and take the first right.  Go down at the
second junction and follow the tunnels into an open area with a rock that needs
to be broken to find Vitalit number 4.  You can also replace your air here if
it's running a bit low.

Right, one more to find and we can leave this god forsaken level.  From the
chamber of Vitalit 4 you need to head back to the junction and go left, 2nd down
and then the first right to locate another Power Sonar Glyph.  From here you
need to head back into the main downward tunnel then take the left turn at the
junction.  This will take you to another junction which has another air pocket
above it should you need it, otherwise head straight across this junction to
collect the fifth Vitalit.  If it is not sitting in the middle of that junction
then Power Sonar the rock just beyond the junction to locate it.  I only say
this because I've played this level on both the DC and PS2 and cannot remember
which one has it in the junction and which one has it within the rock.

Anyways, once you have collected all five Vitalits you will need to find an exit
ASAP.  The quickest way would be to head up, left, then follow the tunnel
upwards as far as possible.  It should bend round to the left then just head
left before meeting back up with the original entry tunnel that leads back to
the door in the floor.  Once you have got back to the stone collar you can just
head right as quick as possible to exit the level back into Up & Down.

                           1.10          UP AND DOWN
                          ===========================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                  Learn Power of Endurance & Power of Stealth
================================================================================

You start the level in a chamber with multiple caverns around the edge with a
very LARGE, HOT rock blocking the volcano underneath it.  Directly in front of
you will be the Endurance Star Glyph.  After collecting it travel round the
level (doesn't matter which way) until you locate the Air & Sonar Glyphs.  After
you have picked them up, sonar the rock in the middle of the chamber to break it
and reveal the second section of the level.  Once the rock has broken your next
task is to head up the tunnel above the volcano and travel through it.  Just as
you enter the tunnel you will notice an Endurance Glyph.  PICK IT UP!!!!  If you
don't you will be unable to complete this section of the level, as the heat that
is rising up from the volcano will kill you.  Assuming that you get to the end
of the tunnel, you will end up in the higher of the two pools that make up the
final part of the level.  If you jump down the waterfall into the lower pool you
will find what you need to locate the Stealth Star Glyph.

Swimming round the level is a Giant Turtle and lying on the floor of the level
will be a Giant Stingray.  What you need to do is call the turtle to you and
move him above the ray.  Once he is swimming over the position of the ray you
need to charge the turtle from above so that he falls down onto the ray.  This
will scare the ray and reveal the Stealth Star Glyph, which you need to collect
before the ray returns to his spot.  Once you have this you will see a dome-
shaped piece of rock that is raised up on small rock 'legs'.  Underneath and
behind this rock is a Stealth Glyph.  Collect it and then make you way to the
end of the level.  There is a mirror there, which stops solid objects from
passing through, but seeing as you have the Stealth power, you pass through with
ease and onto Roaring Forces.

                          1.11          ROARING FORCES
                         ==============================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
      Defeat the sharks, Evade the Giant Eel, Metamorphosis to exit level
================================================================================

When you start the level it is dark and murky, making the sharks hard to spot in
the beginning.  If you swim out of your start position and head to the
right you will see a waterfall and a column of rock with a Stealth Glyph atop
it.  Grab the Glyph, as it will greatly help in your battles with the sharks.
Just a quick point, you only have to kill the sharks if you want to collect the
Vitalits, otherwise just exit the level (whilst invisible) past the Giant
Eel.  The exit point is in the tunnel to the left of the waterfall.  After you
evaded capture in Four Ways he has come back to make sure you don't get any
further.  Once you sneak past him you will become solid and he will start to
chase you. The best advice I can give here is CHARGE & don't get stung by
jellyfish.

You'll know when you get to end of the tunnel chase because a cut-scene will
show the eel getting trapped behind some rocks (guess he failed again, Eh!).
The area you are in now will have a puzzle wall right in front of you.  The
correct way to complete the puzzle is charge the two rock buttons in the middle
that the dolphins are pointing to with their noses, all the other buttons will
be traps.  After you push both buttons you will see the roof
above you open up slightly, just enough for Ecco to go through (lucky you).  Go
through this opening and follow it to the 'Metamorphosis Hall'.  In the
middle of the hall is a glowing Crystal, and swimming around the edge of the
hall is a small fish.

What you need to do is swim into the glowing Crystal, after which Ecco will be
covered in 'stardust'.  You now need to go and chase after that small fish and
touch it with any part of Ecco's body.  This will cause Ecco to transform into a
clone of the fish.  Once the transformation has completed, swim out through the
grate that is blocking the exit into Atlantis Lost.

                         =============================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                 Restore the Guardian, Activate the jump rings
================================================================================

Before you start the level proper, Ecco transforms back into his dolphin form.
After you have control of Ecco again, follow the left hand wall & it will take
you to the first shard.  Keep following the wall until you come into a section
with lots of jellyfish.  Right at the end of the wall the shard will be behind a
small outcropping of rock.  Take this shard back to the Guardian in the central
part of the level and a hoop will appear above one of the four small halls
around the Guardian.  You will need these in a few minutes.  Second shard is in
the lowest point of the ground.  Behind the main hall is a large crack in the
floor.  Go down this crack until you get to ground level and you should see a
hole with a current coming out of it and a ball of rock nearby.

Push the rock into the hole and it will block the current.  Travel down the hole
and you will see a small turning near the bottom.  In there is shard number two.
Once that has been delivered follow the crack again, but stay at the same height
as the white sand.  If you go to the back wall of the level you should see a
Sonar Glyph.  Near the Glyph is a small door in the wall that is blocked.  If
you unblock the hole the third shard is inside this room.  The fourth shard is
near the third.  If you head back towards the door that you just unblocked, just
before you get there you should see a low wall on the left hand side.  Jump over
this wall to find the fourth shard.  Once you have returned all four shards you
need to jump through each of the four hoops that the Guardian has placed above
the four smaller halls.

After jumping through each hoop, go back to each hall and look for a door.
You'll know when you find the doors, as they will open as you go near them (all
the doors are on the sides of the halls that are facing the Guardian).  You now
need to sonar each of the four exhibits within these halls.  Once you've done
all four go into the main hall and sonar each of the four flashing globes to
reveal a projection of different Foe that you will face in the final five levels
of this game.  After doing all of this (That Guardian don't half make you work
for your reward!), you need to go back to that large crack in the floor and you
should notice four flashing rings.  You need to swim down until you are at the
lowest of the four rings and line Ecco up so that when you look through the
rings they form a tunnel.

If you charge into this 'tunnel' and keep Ecco pointing straight ahead you
should gain a huge increase in speed and leap out of the water, towards the
glowing light above the main hall.  This is the fifth shard.  After you have the
shard take it back to the Guardian, who will then be restored as you have
returned all five shards & the level will end.  Time to head into another
reality.

                         ==============================
================================================================================

This version of reality has Man as a dominant and brutal species, building
numerous machines of war with no regard for the ecosystem, or the Dolphin
species that they are enslaving in the process to complete these deadly and
awful weapons of destruction.  Through this reality you will interact with 3
castes of Dolphin, which are Circle (operators), Crimson (caretakers) & Mover
(workforce).

                   ==========================================
================================================================================

Ecco restored the Guardian but it was too late, for the Foe started their
descent, determined to conquer Earth.  By creating a temporal vortex, they
opened a portal through time, and to prevail in the present the Foe would alter
Earth's past.  But as the Foe travelled through time Ecco was caught in the wake
of the vortex as well.  Since the dawn of memory dolphin and human admired each
other, but dolphins had long concealed the true extent of their sentience.  Then
500 years ago the moment arrived and at last they revealed themselves.  A new
civilization was born with dolphin and human united.

It was this epic moment of union that the Foe sought to prevent.  By entrancing
the dolphins with irresistible power, the Foe began to drain them of their most
noble traits.  Just then, Ecco arrived.  He saw that the Foe had almost
completed its sinister task, stealing their intelligence, their ambition, their
compassion, wisdom and humility, robbing dolphins of their future.  With only
moments to act Ecco turned to the ancient power of metamorphosis.  And by taking
the form of the Foe he set out to defend his own kind.

                     ======================================
================================================================================

The destruction of the Foe ship scattered the globes throughout time.  Desperate
to save the precious gifts, Ecco charged into the vortex after them, but with
the past altered, history changed it's course.  Robbed of their traits, the
dolphins became weak and gullible. They were enslaved and exploited, as earth
fell victim to mankind, whose weapons were his only legacy. Only a few dolphins
survived in this altered, dying world, where man is but a distant memory.

                     =====================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
             Reunite the separate clans, collect the Labour Harness
================================================================================

The first thing you notice about these levels is the water is MURKY, and as
such it offers a much shorter distance of vision.  From your start position
head downwards and you will find a MOVER (yellow Dolphins) temple.  You can
talk to the Mover if you want, as he will explain the story from the Mover's
point of view.  If you go below the temple and look on the wall you will find
two very large metal rings.  One of them has a small Mover Dolphin swimming near
it called 'Pilot'.  If you can manage to talk to him he will lead you through
the tunnels to meet his mother, the Prime Mover.  Once you meet her she will
challenge you to a fight.  Charge her until she submits and she will lead you
back out the tunnel and will swim towards the Mover temple.

Once she is there, speak to her again and she will ask you to lead her to the
central temple (your start position).  Once you have taken the Prime Mover to
the temple she will swim around the temple waiting for you to bring the Circle &
Crimson to her as well so they may all sing the "Hymn Of Unity".  There are two
other temples in the level, belonging to the Crimson and Circle clans
respectively.  To make the Crimson Dolphin follow you, you have to swim
below the temple and look on the wall for another hole like what was at the
Mover temple.  Head through this hole, (beware of the piranha fish), until you
get to a cavern with a red pool.  Swim into the red pool and when you leave it
you will find that Ecco has got red tipped fins.

Head back to the Crimson Dolphin, who will now be much happier that he has
another Crimson to talk to.  Lead him to the Prime Mover at the main temple.
Ok, only the Circle Dolphin left now.  Because you have already got red fins the
Circle will be very wary about you, as you are now Crimson.  You will be
challenged to turn the "Circle Of Pain".  If you head down to the floor of the
level you will see a large curved pipe with a wheel on top of it.  Your task (IT
CAN BE DONE) is to turn the wheel 1 rotation CLOCKWISE until the gases that are
coming from it stop.  You will know when you complete the task, as you will hear
a clunk as the wheel locks into place.  Head back to the Circle, who will be
amazed that a Crimson has completed the task.

Lead him to the main temple.  Once all three dolphins are at the main temple,
they will all sing at once (Hymn Of Unity) which will open the doors of the
temple, revealing the Labour Harness, which enables Dolphins to control
machinery with their sonar.  After you have swum inside the temple and collected
the harness, make sure you have enough air before heading to the floor of the
level.  In one of the walls of the level, at floor level is a steel door which
will open if you sonar it.  It will reveal a small sub which you can open by
sonaring that as well.  Once you are inside, Pilot will swim down and join you
and you will depart for Master Of Forgotten Skills.

                    2.04          MASTER OF FORGOTTEN SKILLS
                   ==========================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                             Solve the crate puzzle
================================================================================

This level is here just to solve one puzzle.  I would refer to the Vitalit
positions first, and then go on to complete the puzzle.  In order to complete
the level, you need to push the FULL crate through the door that is off to one
side of the crate storage area.  There are not too many places for air,
although there is an air tank at one corner of the puzzle area, so remember
where it is in relation to your current position so you can get there in a
hurry.  To move the dozer into place to use, you need to find a control column
that has a spinning fan below it.  Make sure you can see all three-control
buttons when you are facing the control column and sonar the first and third
button to activate the crane.  This will then go and collect the dozer and
place it on to the floor of the crate storage area.

                                 =================
                                  DOZER OPERATION
                                 =================

Face the direction you want the dozer to go and sonar the dozer, it will turn
(if required) and start moving in the direction you are facing.  It will ONLY
travel in straight lines, with no obstructions.  If you need the dozer to stop
before it reaches either the edge of the area or the end of a crate, sonar it
FROM THE SIDE and it will stop moving at the next spot it can.  You may need a
bit of practice stopping this thing right where you need to, but it will get
easier.  If you sonar the dozer into the narrow end of a crate, it will lower
its claws onto the lip of the crate, as if ready to move it.  To remove the
claws you need to be facing the side of the claws and sonar them.  They will
then retract from the lip of a crate.

                                 =================
                                  PUZZLE SOLUTION
                                 =================

The solution to the puzzle is easy, unless you're playing on a black & white
TV set.  You have a series of crates that are all half filled with rocks
except one, which is RED in colour.  This is the crate that needs to be pushed
out of the storage area and into the doorway at one side of the area.  First
thing to do is move the dozer into position so that it pushes the PURPLE crate
forward as far as it can go.  Turn the dozer to the right so that it grips
onto the nearest edge of the ORANGE crate and get the dozer to pull the crate
backwards as far as it will go.  Release the ORANGE crate and move the dozer
around to the other narrow edge of the ORANGE crate and push it the final
square until it reaches the edge of the area and cannot go any further.

You should now have an ORANGE crate near the air container at one corner of the
area.  Turn the dozer around and guide it to the YELLOW crate.  Once the dozer
has a grasp of the YELLOW crate, command the dozer to pull (go backwards) the
crate until the dozer stops moving.  Release the claws of the dozer and move
onto the BLUE crate.  Make sure you get the dozer to pull the crate backwards
until the dozer stops moving.  After the dozer stops you can go to the RED
crate and command the dozer to push the crate right out of the storage area
and through a doorway that will open in front of it.  See how easy that was!!
Follow the crate through the door and a cut scene will take over once the
crate has stopped which will lead you into Process That Never Ends.

                     2.05          PROCESS THAT NEVER ENDS
                    =======================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
Activate the machine, Empty a crate of rocks, Find the crusher to exit the level
================================================================================

***On the Dreamcast version, there are no laser pods on the sidewall of the
final chamber.  As far as i can remember, you need to push the rocks into the
middle of them floor so that when the crushing foot pounds down on them they
will force the floor open, thus allowing you access to the next level.***


You will start this level at the start of a closed tunnel.  The level itself
is a very long cylinder.  There are 2 Mover Dolphins here, one of which is
Pilot (from Shrine Of Controversy).  The Mover that is in this level is in the
lower of the two conveyer belt tunnels.  If you continue down the tunnel you
find the Mover dolphin, you will come to a stop as the tunnel is blocked by a
double set of rotating teeth (not active YET). Swimming around the outside of
the tunnel is a Circle Dolphin.  If you speak to him he will inform you that
"The Circle Operate.  I will show you".  As soon as he says that, get back to
the start of the tunnel as quickly as possible.  Once the Circle has turned the
machine on talk to the larger Mover Dolphin.

After you have done that head to the straight end of the conveyer belt and wait
for the two Movers to arrive.  They will position themselves at the wheels of
the crate full of rocks.  If you now move Ecco into the middle of the back of
the crate (where the big circle is on the back), the crate will move and head
into the central area.  Keep pushing until a cut-scene shows a claw grabbing the
crate and emptying the contents at the end of the lower conveyer belt.  If you
now move into the 'Tunnel Of Teeth' you will see that the teeth have now
activated and will quite mercilessly crush anything that gets underneath them.
On the left hand side of the whole length of this tunnel are small pods that
allow you to get air, but they also have symbols in the floor of them, a single
and double cog like picture.

These images are the keys to raise the single and double sets of crushing teeth.
This is where timing comes into play, and that is one thing this walkthrough
won't teach you.  You can only activate the teeth as long as the symbol is red.
If it is greyed out then the switch is inoperative and will not open any of the
teeth, so you have to know when you need to go backwards in order to come
forwards.  Once you've made it past the final set of teeth you will see a tall
chamber with two 'Laser Polisher' type objects either side of the conveyer belt.
If there are any rocks still going through then these lasers should fire at the
rock and give the rock a shiny reflective type quality.

At the end of this chamber is a downward slope, which leads into a large round
chamber, with a rather large three-piece crushing foot.  The final objective is
to push any rocks not already in the main chamber into it from the slope.  Once
they are all in the chamber you need to move the rocks into place so that a
laser light from one side of the room will reach right across to the other side.
You will see two pods on the side of the walls.  These are what the light has to
go between and the rocks act as a carrier.  Once the link has been completed the
floor will open up, which you need to swim down to access Blades In Motion.

[N.B.]
I've also got the floor to open up by moving all the rocks into the middle of
the area, without having the light going between them all, so now I'm not too
sure how to make the floor drop.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
           Reclaim a Dolphin trait, Kill the Crayfish, solve the maze
================================================================================

You will start underneath the floor that you went through to get here.  Head
down through the tube in the bottom of the floor and follow the direction of the
conveyer belt.  There will be 2 'Tiger Sharks' (maybe they aren't really, but
they're bloody fast, and more vicious then regular sharks) in this area, which
you will need to avoid.  Up near the top of the level will be several support
braces going across the width of the room, and above one of these will be a
Power Sonar Glyph.  You will need this for the next part of the level.
Collect the Glyph and continue through the doorway at the end of the room.  In
this circular chamber you will be pushed around the chamber until you see one
section of the internal glass with yellow cracks on it.

You need to shatter this with you Power Sonar.  If you fail to complete it
before you run out of sonar then go back to the Tiger Sharks to collect the
Glyph again, then repeat the process.  Once the glass is shattered (5 hits
required), go through it into the central section of the level.  Recharge you
air if you need to, using the Air Glyph.  Head down and go through the holes in
the rotating grates until you reach the bottom.  Once you go through the last
grate you will need to collect the Power Sonar Glyph that is in the bottom
section with you as you're gonna need it, as well as some very good control
skills of Ecco.  Collect the Glyph then go down towards the red light in the
floor, but DON'T GO INTO THE LIGHT.

Once you're in the area, look around the edge and you should see a tube, which
you can swim through.  This will lead to a tube with a fast current that you
have to fight against as you need to break the crack in the top of the tube, in
the same way you did it to the glass wall earlier in the level.  If you run out
of Power Sonar, then go back up the tube you just came out of and re-collect the
Sonar Glyph and repeat the process again.  After you've broken the crack, swim
outside the tube into the relative safety of the chamber.  Once you're in this
outer chamber head back the way you came, as there is an air pipe at the back
section of this area.  Once you've restocked you air, head towards the front
wall of the area and collect the Power Sonar Glyph, then go back into the tunnel
you came out of and follow the current.

There will be another crack in the floor of the tube this time, which you need
to break again to escape.  Once you've broken your way out of the tube, head
towards the red flashing light at the end and you will see a red door in the
floor.  Go through this door and you will collect the Dolphin Trait that is
blocking your way through.  After going through the door you will encounter the
boss for this level, a large Crayfish type creature with rather large claws.
There are three holes in the sides of this section which this creature will come
out of.  It will then thrash around after anything that moves, so for your own
sake keep VERY STILL.  Best thing to do is watch the small school of fish, as
they move away from where the creature is coming out from, so stick with them
and you should be ok.

Once it has caught its lunch or given up (whichever comes first) it will fold
its arms in and start to go backwards into its hole.  While the creature
retracts back into its hole, you will see a section of its underbelly flash
yellow.  This is the section you need to charge three times in order to defeat
the creature and gain access to the final section of the level.  Head down into
the hole that the creature has just uncovered (don't worry, he's not in there
waiting for you).  The maze section is just that, a maze.  Get one turn wrong
and you could go round in circles wondering where to go.  Thankfully though you
have ME to help you through this.  At each junction point of the maze is a
globe, which, if you sonar will produce a light to mark where you've been.

The following solution will deal with going straight to the exit via the
quickest route.  Each globe is called G'x' (where x is the number I have given
it).  Once you enter the maze you will see fish on one side and an air pipe on
the other. Head towards the fish to G1 and continue forward, G2 continue
forward, G3 turn left, G4 turn right, G5 go forward (the corridor up is a dead
end with nothing in it), G6 go down, G7 head forward, G8 turn right & G9 head up
towards the exit, and onto Perpetual Fluidity.

                   solve the switch puzzle to exit the level
================================================================================

Your start point is nothing special, just a cylindrical room with only one
exit point straight ahead of you.  Once you enter this door you will go
through a VERY long tunnel that will eventually open out into a room filled
with underwater mines.  They look like brown eggs with red flashing lights
coming out of them.  If Ecco touches one then he will sustain damage.  You can
move them with your Sonar but it's hardly worth the effort to do it.  Head to
the floor of the room and swim to the wall opposite.  High up in the wall is
another door that you need to go through.  It is possible to do it without
setting off one single mine.  You will enter a short tunnel, which will lead to
another room and will have an Info Glyph, which tells you "Cage Is A Prison,
Protecting Both Sides".

This is a clue to the next room you enter which contains a shark ALMOST as big
as the GWS from Level 2.  If you swim into the 'Cage' that the fallen girder has
created, it will protect you from the shark and lead you to a yellow switch in
the wall.  You need to sonar the RED icon to turn it green in colour, as this
denotes open or closed.  Once you have opened the switch, move into the other
'cage' and go through the door you just opened by opening the yellow switch.
Move down the tunnel into the next room and take the LEFT exit out of the room.
IN the next room will be another Info Glyph, which tells you:  "Never the same
one twice in sequence, RED, GREEN, RED & GREEN, BLUE & YELLOW, One with no
colours, BLUE & YELLOW, and no colours again".

What this riddle relates to is the colours (or lack of) of the doors that each
switch opens or closes.  In this same room will be your first switch (RED).
Sonar the icon BELOW the door colour to activate the door.  This will raise
the water level in this chamber and reveal a red door that is now opened above
you on the LEFT hand wall.  Go through this tunnel, fighting the current until
you enter another room.  This will contain another switch BUT DON'T SONAR IT
YET.  Below your entry point into the room, ON THE SAME WALL as your entry point
will be another tunnel that you need to go into to get to switch number 2
(GREEN).  Activate the switch then exit the room via the same way you came in.
When you reach the room at the end of this tunnel, this will contain switch
number 3 (RED & GREEN).

After activation of switch 3, head up and you will see a tunnel with an open
GREEN door.  Head through this into the next chamber.  In here you will find
switch number 4 (BLUE & YELLOW) which you need to activate as soon as you can,
then exit the chamber through the BLUE tunnel you just opened.  Once you get
into the next chamber head down from the tunnel and you will see a switch with
no DOOR colour, but a water level indicator.  This is switch number 5 in the
sequence.  Sonar it as soon as you can then exit back the way you came and de-
activate the BLUE & YELLOW switch again.  After that head up and go back through
the GREEN tunnel.  In the next chamber on the wall opposite you will be another
tunnel.  Swim down that tunnel into the next chamber.  Here you have 2 choices.

You can now choose your path.  Go into the tunnel opposite you, which will lead
you into a dead end chamber, or you could head down and go through the tunnel
next to the Riddle Glyph (Yep, back at the start again).  When you get through
the tunnel & you are back in that first room, head UP & LEFT and go through the
tunnel into the next chamber and head straight across into the next tunnel.
When you get to the next chamber head down and sonar the final switch in the
sequence (BLANK).  Collect the Power Sonar Glyph and head to the tunnel with red
spiked rocks in the mouth of it and Power Sonar them out of the way.  Once you
have cleared a path, enter the tunnel and once you pass the fan blade you will
exit into Obscure Ways To Terminus.

                    ========================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                              Find the exit tunnel
================================================================================

This level has no enemies apart from the series of tunnels that all lead back
to your start position, except one.  From your start position, head over to
the furthest tunnel on the left hand side and travel through it.  The current
will pull you along so don't charge.  In actual fact it may help if you use
Ecco's 'Quick stop' move to slow yourself down a bit.  Once you get into an
open area with a glass wall on one side of you head down below the current so
you don't get swept back to your start position.  This level is all about
jumping and timing, so patience is what you will need most to complete this
one.

If you swim to the waters surface by swimming up the solid wall then turn
around to face the clear wall, you should notice one star on the wall right
near the top.  These star markers will help you as you progress through the
next phase of this level.  The best way I found to complete this level (and it
may not work for everyone) is to swim near the top of the surface of the water
so that you're just high enough to avoid the current, but low enough that you
can charge out of the water in order to jump over the glass walls.  Each of
the walls has a star symbol on it, ranging from 1 to 5 stars. This is there to
tell you what chamber you are in and what chamber is next to jump over too.
As long as you jump 1-2-3-4-5 then you are going the right way.  Once you've
cleared wall number 5, swim to the bottom of the area you have jumped into.

You need to enter the tunnel that is nearest the metal wall, as the tunnel
near the glass wall will shove you back to the beginning of the level.  Once
you go through the tunnel into another open area, swim out of the current
again towards the floor.  On the sidewall will be a tunnel opening.  Swim into
it to exit the level and progress onto Sleeping Forces Of Doom.

                    =======================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
   Destroy the 'snake arms', destroy the central shield to stop the generator
================================================================================

This level is very simple; kill the Generator in the middle.  Around the
outside are three snake type arms that will grab one of the rocks flying round
the room.  It will then retract and coil around the rock until it gets back to
the sidewall, it will then feed the generator with the power from the rock.
Your first task is to destroy the arms.  To accomplish this feat you need to
sonar the arms when they have a rock in their grasp.  Keep swimming with the
current and doing it to each arm as you come to it.  Don't worry too much about
the rocks feeding the generator, as we will tackle this in a moment.  After
several hits, each arm will in turn burst into flame and die off.  This is part
one over.

If you run low on air there are air bubbles at floor level, near the centre of
the level.  You will see them as they have a blue colour on the top of the pod
in the floor.  If you run low on energy then there is a school of fish on the
very outskirts of the level, near the small slit windows that are quite high in
the level.  To complete the level you need to use your "Sonar Grab" to hold a
rock and alter it's direction so that it swings towards the centre and smashes
the glowing walls that are still left (if any).  To use your "Sonar Grab" you
need to double tap (but hold on the second tap) your Square button.  This will
create a 'vortex' of sonar, which will hold any nearby rock for a short space of
time.

To throw the rock you need to swing Ecco to the left or right and release the
sonar button, as this will alter the direction of the rocks and should hopefully
smash out the shields surrounding the generator.  Once you have destroyed all of
the remaining walls swim into the centre of the generator, head down and collect
the Dolphin Trait globe at the bottom.

                       ==================================
================================================================================

This reality has split the dolphins off into two halves, the Clan & the
Outcast.  The Clan is a highly aggressive and territorial group who have
disfigured bodies that have bone-like spines running down both sides of their
back.  They are mostly yellow in colour apart from the "Exalted Ones", who are
the rulers of the Clan.  The Outcast are all green in colour and are a non-
aggressive species, but they will protect their own kind if threatened.

                   =========================================
================================================================================

By reclaiming the stolen globes, Ecco reopened the time vortex.  The dolphins of
the past were ignorant of what had been stolen from them, and unaware that their
descendants would be denied the golden age.  But when intelligence and ambition
were returned to them, dolphins changed and history was altered, but Ecco's
world was not restored.  Dolphins became aggressive and forced humans from the
seas, never to return. And dolphins built a new reality, creating a nightmare of
their own.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
     Feed the village, bring red fish to the 'Father', learn the Plant Song
================================================================================

If you talk to the various Dolphins they will all say they are starving and
cannot find any food.  The whole village has been cut off from their only
means of getting food, so it is up to Ecco to provide some food for the
village.  There are only a few things to do here in order to progress to the
next level.  Swim around the level and find the 'Son' Dolphin.  In the pods
below him will be his sick Father.  He will ask for fish to help heal him.
Next thing to do is find the tunnel with a Rock fall at the end of it.  If you
jump over this wall you will find a sonar Glyph nearby.  Collect it and destroy
the wall you just jumped over.  On your right side will be a school of red fish,
which you need to lead back to the sick Father.

Once they are in front of his pod he will swim out and talk to Ecco to thank
him.  If you then go and talk to his Son he will ask you to follow him to the
'Channel Of Death'.  If you then follow him he will lead you through the first
half of it.  Once you are in a clearing you must talk to him so that he will
teach you the Plant Song.  After he has taught you the song he will go back to
the village, so now you have to negotiate the second half of it on your own.  As
long as you take you time and sing to each plant you see you should be able to
get through and onto Entrapment.

[N.B.]
There is a second way into Entrapment.  This bypasses the Channel Of Death
altogether and brings you out into a different start position for Entrapment.
To do this you need to go into the area with the red fish and swim along the
floor until you find a HUGE colourful fish with lips like Mick Jagger.  It is
called a Coelacanth (See-Low-Canth).  If you watch his swimming pattern for a
little while you will see him spit out a school of fish, which will swim nearby
for a few seconds, then go back into his mouth.  What you need to do is find a
Stealth Glyph and swim into the Coelacanth's mouth when the fish go back inside.
This will take you to a different start point of entrapment then what you would
reach via the Channel Of Death.

          ===========================================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
  Rescue the Outcast, defend the village, learn the location of the Resistance
================================================================================

From your start position head straight ahead and slightly upwards to collect
the Vigour Glyph in order to double your energy bar.  After that, sonar the
trumpet plant nearby, then swim down into the trench so that the plant you
just sang to is behind you, as this will take you over to the sidewall of the
level.  Exit the trench and follow the wall round to the right until you see
another trumpet plant.  Sonar this plant and then head straight over it
towards another trench, which will contain a Stealth Glyph inside it and an
Air Glyph above it.  Collect the Stealth Glyph so that the Clan cannot see
you, and the Air Glyph to boost your air bar, then head towards the large
green gates embedded in the wall, and as long as they are open then swim
through them.

Once you are on the other side of the gates you need to sonar the trumpet
plant to keep the Clan that are on this side busy.  In the middle of this
section is a detention centre and you need to find a way inside it.  On the
side of the centre, near the trumpet plant you should see a round object,
which you will need to charge into.  As you do it will move.  This is your key
to getting inside the centre as it has opened the door in at the left end of
the centre.  It will look like a brown membrane window with a hole in it; this
is your entry point.  Now you are inside you will need to find the Resistance
Leader.

From the first room you will need to find the only open doorway and travel
into the next room.  In room 2 you will see a small brown switch with an
orange light on it.  You will need to sonar this to open up more doors.  You
will know when you have done it, as the switch will turn blue.  If you are
facing the switch when it turns blue then turn to your left and you should see
a doorway open up.  This will go into a short tunnel into room 3.  In here
will be another switch and after you have turned it on then a doorway will
open up which will lead into a tunnel that will split into two.  You need to
take the right hand fork of that tunnel.  This will lead you into the biggest
room so far, room 4.  In here will be 2 more switches, and a highly aggressive
Clan dolphin.  It is possible to kill this dolphin, but seems to take forever.

Once he is dead (if you do try it) then turn on both switches and exit this
room through the last doorway (if you follow the room round in a clockwise
direction, with the outer wall on your left flipper side).  This will take you
back to the original room that you entered through the window of.  If you have
the window behind you, you will need to exit this room through the second
doorway from the left.  The room that you enter now will have another Clan
dolphin in it, along with a green, oblong shaped object on one wall, which has
a Vigour Glyph behind it.  There will also be one more switch here, which
after being turned on will reveal another doorway to go through.

This doorway is to the right of the doorway you used to enter this room.  Travel
down the tunnel and you will be at the Detention room itself.  In the middle
will be the Outcast Resistance Leader, being held in place by four energy
leashes. Once you have control of Ecco, move into the room.  You have two
choices here, you can either just swim around the room giving three hits to each
energy leash or you can first kill the Clan dolphin here.  Killing the dolphin
is not required, so the choice is up to you.  Once you have freed the Resistance
Leader a movie will take over showing Ecco and the Resistance Leader busting
free from the centre and getting back past the Clan gates.

Once you have control of Ecco again, check nearby, as you will more then
likely see a Clan dolphin swimming towards you, ready for attack.  Stun and
hit him then locate the nearest trumpet plant and sonar it.    If you swim
past the trumpet plant and check near the 'table-tops' of rock near the floor
you should see the Leader dolphin waiting for you.  Sing to the dolphin and he
will follow you.  Your task now is to lead the Resistance Leader back to the
tunnel of death.  Once you are there he will swim off and move to the Caverns
Of Hope, but you still need to find the way there, so for the time being its
swimming back to Anguish Of Dearth for you.

Once you are back in the main section of the Outcast village, you will notice
Clan Sharks attacking the village.  You need to attack and kill every shark in
the level (3 sharks, 3 hits each) before you can progress further.  Once they
have all been disposed of you will need to find a HUGE boulder with an Outcast
dolphin sleeping in a pod nearby.  Sing to him and he will open up the exit to
Caverns Of Hope.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
  Protect the Outcast leader from attacking Clan members, defeat the Crocodile
================================================================================

This level is very simple to begin with, but very frustrating near the end.
In the first part all you have to do is get to the Caverns Of Hope themselves.
You must swim/charge as fast as possible to defeat the current in the tunnels.
At random places in the tunnels you will see Outcast dolphins throwing spiked
rocks at you.  Well, right now they still think you are the enemy, BUT you can
convince them that you are one of the good guys by singing to them AFTER you
have passed them and they start chasing you.  It is not required to sing to them
though, so the choice is up to you.  After you have got past the first two
Dolphins, you will find a tunnel off to the left which will you will need to go
down, then turn left again in order to continue your journey.

After you pass two more dolphins you will see another tunnel off to the right
and the tunnel straight ahead of you.  You need to continue forward, ignoring
the tunnel on the right.  At the end of the tunnel it will head upwards towards
the surface.  You need to jump out of the water and over a small wall here into
another pool, then from there you need to jump over the wall again to get into
the final section of the tunnels leading to the Caverns.  In this final tunnel
section you will find an Air Glyph, as well as one more dolphin on defence duty.
After you have passed this final dolphin it is a straight swim towards the
caverns themselves.  Swim towards the central column that you can see as Ecco
enters the main cavern, then turn left and head into the alcove with some pods
stuck to the wall.

Behind these pods will be another Dolphin Trait, which you will need to collect
before you can continue.  Once you have the globe, follow the wall of the
chamber round until you find a dolphin swimming near a crystal wall.  Sing to
him and he will speak to you, then swim towards the crystal wall and break it.
As soon as the tunnel beyond is revealed he will start swimming down the tunnel
and here is where the game becomes frustrating.  A word of warning.  If you are
sloppy in your duties of defending the Resistance Leader and he gets hit by one
of the Clan, he will turn tail and swim back to the start of the tunnel where it
begins at the Caverns.  The only way to stop him is to sing to him to convince
him to carry on the journey.

This is most annoying if you are right at the end and he gets spooked, as it's a
long way back to the start if you don't manage to sing to him before he gets
back there, so be very aware of what is going on around Ecco and don't get too
far ahead of the Resistance Leader.  While swimming down the tunnel, your job is
to protect the dolphin from the Clan dolphins lying in wait for him to swim
past.  As he approaches each section of the tunnel, a Clan dolphin will appear
out of the sidewall, either above, below or level with Ecco.  You need to sing
to them to make them stop attacking, then charge them to make them retreat back
to the hole they came from.  There are four Clan dolphins in the first section
of the tunnel, before the Leader goes through a small hole leading to section
two.

Two more are in the next, short section of the tunnel before heading into
another hole to section three.  There are two more final Clan dolphins in
section three.  The resistance leader will move through the small cave into
section four which is where he will sing to another wall of crystal to allow you
to continue on your journey, then he will go all the way back to the Caverns to
help with the fighting.  All that work and he goes back!  Doesn't seem fair,
does it?  Anyways, if you continue forward, through into the next section that
the leader exposed for you, you will find an Air Glyph and another small tunnel,
which you will need to swim down to face the Crocodile.

The easiest way (and the way I will describe here because I'm a lazy sod and
can't be bothered to fight him the 'proper' way) to destroy the croc is to
collect the Power Sonar that is on the floor of the level, near the right hand
side of the stone spikes that are sticking out of the floor that you see when
you enter this section.  Once you have the Power Sonar, swim back to a
reasonably safe distance (you can get fairly close before the croc comes to see
if you are dinner or desert) and start to sonar all the stalactites in the roof.
Do not just randomly knock them down; you need to try to work out where the croc
is and only release those that are above him.  If one of them does hit him then
it is an easy, one-hit kill and the Croc will leave through a tunnel at the
back of the level.  Exit out through this tunnel until you get to the surface,
then jump over the wall into another pool with the tunnel that exits this
level and moves you onto Lair Of Evil.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                  Gain a 2-star mark, fix the branding machine,
                      Gain a 3-star mark to exit the level
================================================================================

You are in the training facility of the Clan.  This place is also where the
Clan get their rank markings.  Go forward from your start position and enter
the tunnel that comes up on your right side.  When you get to the other end of
the tunnel it will open out into a room with two Clan dolphins swimming around.
In this room will be numerous doors with a 2-star swirl on them.  At present
Ecco cannot open these doors, so find the door which is open and swim down the
tunnel beyond, this will bring you out into another room with a black Clan
dolphin who knows you are not Clan , and tries to attack you every time you
enter this room (annoying, isn't it?)  In this room will be three doors, the one
you just used to get here, and another 2-star door with a green emblem on it
that is supposed to represent a clamshell with a ball of ink (use your
imagination people!), and another door, which you can enter as well.

If you stay in front of the 2-star door, the Clan dolphin will swim over to you
to open a can of whoop ass on ya, but the door will open as she gets near.  Go
through the door and travel down the tunnel until you get to the Branding room.
There is air behind the huge shell if you need it.  In the tunnel are tubes
hanging from the roof with a blue swirling glow inside them.  These are speed
tubes and are spread throughout the level.  By swimming through them Ecco is
propelled at great speed towards the next speed tube.  I would advise using
these as it will speed up getting through some of the longer tunnels and help
you spread your air supply a bit further.  Here is the first part to completing
this level, which is to get Ecco branded so that you can open the 2-star doors
yourself.

To the side of the shell are three switches, which you will need to sonar in
sequence in order to get the branding machine to give Ecco a 2-star mark.  Sonar
the left switch first to open the shell, then the right one to make a ball of
ink drop down from the tube in the roof.  After the shell has closed and
reopened, place Ecco inside the shell so that he is facing the 'stalk' that is
sticking out of the middle switch.  Once Ecco is inside the shell, sonar this
middle switch and watch as the shell closes and marks Ecco.  After you have
gained your first mark, head back down the tunnel until you reach that nagging
black Clan dolphin.  Go through the tunnel on your right hand side and it will
take you to a room with three exits, the tunnel you just used, a 2-star door
with nothing in front of it (which will take you back to the first room you
entered with the two Clan dolphins), and another 2-star door with a green oblong
shape rotating in front of it.

Travel through this door and it will bring you into the biggest part of the
level, with a huge structure in the middle of the room.  This is also the room
you need to get to in order to exit the level.  Near this central structure will
be another black Clan dolphin.  If you sing to him he will ask you to follow him
to fix the branding station, so follow him.  Once you have reached the next room
he will sit outside a 3-star door so that it will open for you.  Swim into this
tunnel and follow it until you come into a room with a rotating blade type item
in the ceiling.  This is one of the two things needed to get the branding
station to work properly.  The other one will be prevented from turning by a
stray piece of weed, which has tied itself around one of the arms.

On the left wall as you enter the room will be a glowing switch, which you will
need to sonar in order to turn it off.  Collect the Power Sonar in this room and
swim to the top of the room to find the blocked 'fan' and use the sonar to break
the weed.  After the weed has been removed you will need to turn the switch back
on so that the branding machine will work when you return to it in a short
while.  Exit the room and head back to where the black Clan dolphin still has
the door open for you.  After you get to the end of that tunnel, backtrack and
head through the left tunnel so that it takes you back to the main chamber where
you first found him.  Exit this room through the 2-star door with a pink light
in front of it to take you back to the two yellow Clan room, then exit this room
through the only tunnel without a door which will lead you back to the 'old nag'
black Clan dolphin.

This is the room, which you need to retrace your steps back to the clamshell-
branding machine, so go through the tunnel with the green icon in front of the
door.  Once you are back in the branding station room, you should see a large
stone disc behind the shell with the 2-star and 3-star markings on it.  If you
sonar the central orange light the machine will change the marking to a 3-star
mark.  Once you have changed the marking, repeat the earlier steps to give Ecco
a 3-star mark.  Once Ecco has the 3-star mark you need to work your way back to
the central chamber with that large structure in the central area of it.

There are two possible doors that you can exit through, but they both lead to
the same place.  To the left and above the two doors with the blue and pink
lights on them is a 3-star door with a small circular green symbol on it.  You
could enter this tunnel then turn left when you reach the junction, as this will
take you into Powers Of Levitation.  Second way (well, second door) is a
tunnel entrance that has a glowing white ring blocking it. When Ecco approaches
it the ring will retract and Ecco can just swim all the way to the other end of
the tunnel.  Whichever way you chose, the eventual exit point is still the same.

                      ====================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
        Locate the Resistance Leader, Start the Hanging Waters Generator
================================================================================

You start this level just past the doors you came through when entering from
Lair Of Evil.  Swim forward from your start position and follow the stone 'rib
cage' that is just outside the tunnel entrance.  You should see a pillar in
front of you and if you swim to the left of that you should see something that
slightly resembles the Sydney Opera House.  Swim past this so that you are
heading into the central area of the level and you should see a large globe in
the middle.  Swim around it until you find an entrance with an Info Glyph near
it, and also an Air Glyph near the jellyfish.  If you talk to the Clan dolphin
outside this entrance he will tell you that he is the engineer of the facility
(HIGHLY IMPORTANT).

Once you have this information you can swim inside the central globe and head
downwards.  Eventually you will come to another tunnel that is oval in shape and
has a membrane door covering it a little way down it.  Swim through these
membranes, as they will open up for you.  Ignore any left or right hand tunnels
just for now, as your first task is to speak to the facility's Clan General in
the central room.  Once you speak to the general she will swim off to do an
inspection.  After the general has left the room you will need to follow her as
closely as you can without her spotting you.  If you manage to accomplish this
feat you will see her swim into a stone pillar, which you will need to follow
her into quickly, as the door on it only stays open for a few seconds.

Once you are inside you will see the Resistance dolphin from Caverns Of Hope &
Entrapment, and they will inform you that they are working together to try to
get the other globes.  It is here that you learn about the Hanging Waters, and
you will also receive a password, which will allow you access through the other
doors inside the facility.  After getting this new information, swim back to the
entrance with the engineer dolphin and speak to him.  He will then go inside the
upper chamber and start preparing the machine to be used.  Your next task is to
turn on all the power switches to make the generator work.  Go back to the
tunnels with the membranes covering them, and turn left at the first junction
and swim through the door.

At the first junction in this new hallway turn left; enter the room and sonar
the purple switch to activate the first of eight power couplings.  When you exit
the room, remember to turn left again otherwise you will be heading back the way
you came.  At the next junction turn left and activate the second coupling in
this room also.  Third junction, repeat the process for the other two rooms, and
the same with the fourth junction.  Ok, we are halfway there, only four more
couplings left to find.  After the fourth room, once you are back in the main
tunnel you will go through a membrane door, this signifies that you have done a
complete circuit of this tunnel.  When you reach the next junction this will be
the point at which you enter this area from the outside.

If you turn right and head to the next junction, then turn right again and
follow the tunnel round, through the doorway in front of you.  Ignore the first
junction, as there is nothing of use in the room.  Continue forward to the next
junction.  Once you are there, turn left and enter the room to find the fifth
power coupling and also the security chief, who is none too pleased to find you
there as he is aware that you are not of the Clan.  You must dispose of the
chief before you can continue.  Once you have dealt with the chief you can turn
on the switch that is in the room by charging it.  The fifth power coupling is
in the tunnel to the left when you exit the room, and is through the door that
you opened by turning that switch on.

It seems a shame that the fifth power coupling is a pair of whales.  Once you
have spoken to them you need to work your way back to the entrance of this
tunnel section.  Quickest way to get there is go back through the door you came
in from, then turn left at the first junction, then turn left again when you get
to another junction. After you pass through another membrane door, turn right
and you will be back at the start of this section.  OK, we've got five of the
eight couplings switched on. Lets go find the remaining three.  If you swim
upwards a short distance, you will start to see small windows looking into the
middle of a chamber.  The first window that is above the tunnel section you just
came out of has no glass, so you can enter this middle chamber.

In the floor of the chamber will be three large fan exhausts, each containing
one switch.  Swim into each fan exhaust in turn and travel down it until you
come to a large fan with the switch just in front of it.  Turn these last
remaining switches on and then exit this central area back through the window
with no glass.  Swim to the top of the tunnel until you get into a room that has
something resembling an organ in it.  The engineer and the Clan General will
each have their heads inside a harness. If you sonar the Clan General she will
inform you to do the same as both she and the engineer are doing.  Guide Ecco
into the middle harness and then sit back as the game takes over and creates
your exit point to Hanging Waters.

                     3.07          HANGING WATERS OVERVIEW
                    =======================================

A few things before you start this level.  The learning curve for controlling
Ecco has just become the game players' version of a vertical wall.  The level
as a whole is L-O-N-G!  VERY L-O-N-G.  You WILL die, and die often.  This
level will take patience and time to complete.  It may be one of the most
visually stunning and unique levels, but it is also the hardest in getting
from point A to point B without having to restart countless times.

I have broken with 'standard' walkthrough tradition and split the level into
three parts.  The reason for this is because at three points of the level you
must defeat each of the three rulers of the Clan.  These add a nice break to
the proceedings and stop the level as a whole getting very tiresome and
monotonous.

If you decide to stop the level before you defeat the Mutaclone level, then
try to restart the level from the level select; you will start RIGHT BACK AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL.  The best thing to do if you want to stop is play a
section to the start of the boss for that level, then you can restart back at
that boss without having to redo the WHOLE of the Hanging Waters from the very
start.

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                          Get to the first Clan ruler
================================================================================

From your start position head forward and jump over the barriers blocking your
way.  Jump into the pool below at the end of the tube.  Once you are there you
will start to see bubbles floating to the waters surface, and after a few
seconds they will float out of the water and float upwards.  You need to jump
into one of the larger bubbles and ride it up towards the tube entrance with a
blue swirl on it.  When you feel that you are close enough to try, jump from
the bubble into the tube and swim to the end and drop down into another pool.
In the pool will be a rock with a bubble above the waters surface that has
some reeds hanging from it that are just touching the surface.  You need to
jump into this bubble, then turn and make you way from bubble to bubble until
you reach the highest bubble.

Some of these bubbles will be a silver reflective colour and will bounce you off
of them as you hit them.  The idea is that you use these to jump over distances
that Ecco normally wouldn't be able to cover.  Once you have reached the highest
bubble of this section, you will need to jump into the tube above.  Travel
through the tube until you get to a fork.  Take the left hand tube and jump into
the bubble with the spinning rock around it and sonar the 'water trumpet' that
is inside.  This will create a *TEMPORARY* tube that links two tubes together.
You need to *QUICKLY* go back into the tube you just jumped from and go to the
exit point where the new tube has been created.  Jump into this new tube and
swim to its end, then jump out of it into another tube (don't worry, this one is
permanent).

Swim to the end of this tube until you find two more tubes that you can jump
across into.  Jump into the left hand tube, as this will have a current pushing
you along it towards a large floating rock structure.  You will need to jump out
of the end of the tube and into the rock.  Once there you will need to find an
exit point.  There will be two tubes both pointing downwards, either one will
suffice for now, so jump into one of them.  If you have jumped into the top
tube, then you will need to drop down into the bottom tube once you get near the
end of the tube.  Don't worry about this if you are already in the bottom tube.
There will be a swift current coming out of the top tube which will prevent you
from going further, so if you drop down into the bottom tube, then slowly make
you way right to the end of the tube.

Once you are there you will need to jump up and forwards into the fast flowing
tube ahead of you, then CHARGE and swim like mad until you are past the yellow
collar.  Now we have another fork in the tubes.  Take the left tube and repeat
what you did earlier to create a new water tube.  Go back to the fork and then
head towards the new tube, jump into it and swim to its end.  You will find
three tubes, jump into the middle one, and then STOP.  Jump across to the left
hand tube and follow it until you find some large rotating rocks blocking your
path.  These rocks have a random rotation, and at some points of their spinning
cycle will give you just enough space to get Ecco through.  This is where you
will more then likely want to throw the controller right through your TV set,
but it can be done.

After you have passed the rocks, swim to the end of the tube then jump up into
the tube above you.  Swim to the end of this tube and you see another water
trumpet.  At this point you will now have to create your own path of tubes to
get to the next area.  You will accomplish this by swimming to the end of each
tube that you create then sonaring the water trumpet that is in front (either
above or below) of you.  Once you have jumped through all these tubes you will
come to a tube with a purple collar, and a second tube below it.  You need to
jump down into this second tube and let the current carry you onto a third tube
that will go round to the right.  This will end up opening out onto another
bubble.

From here you will need to leap across to the bubble ahead and below you, and
from there you need to jump down into the pool at the bottom, below the very
large bubble on your left.  Once you are in the pool you should see a green stem
coming down from the middle of the large bubble above you.  Go inside the stem
and this will lead you onto Ice And Fire.

================================================================================

This level is called Ice & Fire for a reason.  In the ceiling of the level
will be a big Fire rock and in the floor will be a big Ice rock.  The Exalted
One can become Fire or Ice depending on what colour rock he swims into.  If
the dolphin is Fire, make him swim into the Ice rock. If he is Ice, then make
him swim into the Fire rock.  After several hits a cut scene will take over to
show the destruction of the boss and Ecco will leap back into the pool below,
which will be the start position of Hanging Waters II.

                       =================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
              Defeat the Giant Squid; Get to the second Clan ruler
================================================================================

From your start point, if you look around the walls of the pool you will see a
tunnel entrance that will lead you out to a new water tube.  Jump into the
tube and you will notice a very strong current dragging you along.  If the
current gets too strong that you cannot control where Ecco is facing, then
pull back on the right analogue stick to make Ecco slow down.  This will be
useful again later in the level.  The 'current' tube will eject you out into a
tube with more membrane barriers blocking your path.  These are worse then the
ones in section one as they have a strong current pushing against you if you
get too close.  You will also notice that there are a total of three tubes.

The trick here is to ease forward slowly to each membrane until it starts to
push against you being there.  This will give you an indication of how close
you can get.  You need to use patience, skill and a lot of self-control in
completing this section.  I will give each tube a number just so I can guide you
through this section slightly easier.  From tube 1 (your starting position) jump
down into tube 2 (the bottom one of the other two tubes).  After that you need
to get the distance just right so that you can jump into tube 3 (the one above
you right now) and avoid being thrown back into the membrane by the current.
Once you get to the next membrane you need to jump down into tube 2 again, then
from there you need to jump over the membrane in front of you.

If you get Ecco pointing so that his nose is pointing almost straight up then
charge from a standing start you should have enough momentum to jump right over
the membrane and safely to the other side.  Once there you will need to swim a
short way forward, then stop.  If you turn to face tubes 1 & 3 you should be
able to see where the membranes are in tube 1.  If you notice, they stop after a
point.  It is this point that you need to get to, so you need to jump back
across to tube 3 between two of the membranes.  This doesn't give you a lot of
space to work with, but there is just enough for what you need it for.  After
you are back in tube 3 and have gotten Ecco into position, you need to jump
across to tube 1, past the final membrane.

This portion of the level itself has driven completely normal people totally
bonkers; so don't worry if you don't get it on your first time out.  After you
have got past that little puzzle and swum a short distance on, you will get
caught in another strong current.  Once again, if it becomes a bit hard to
control Ecco then simply pull back on the right stick and Ecco will slow down to
make things easier for you.  After the current tube you will end up in a bubble.
Ahead of you will be three tubes, and they will be guarded by a rather LARGE
Giant Squid.  Do not try to jump into the tubes just yet as the Squid will knock
you senseless before you know what's going on.  If you look behind and above
Ecco you will see three small lights.  This is the switch to turn the tubes on.

Aha, but wait!  If this is the ON switch, where are the OFF switches?  Good
question, how bouts we go find them.  Jump into the tube to the left of the
three tubes and you will get swept along in a strong current.  Pull back on the
right stick so that Ecco slows down slightly.  Coming up on the left hand side
will be a bubble that Ecco has to jump into in order to find the first switch.
Once you are in the bubble you need to jump into the floating rock in front of
you.  Make you way down the short tunnel until you come to a small pool area
with two possible exits.  You need the left hand exit, so jump into that bubble
and sing to the water trumpet.  It will create a tube above the bubble you are
in, so jump into the tube and swim through it and then jump into the tube it
connects up with.

This will take you to another water trumpet, which will create another tube,
right in front of you.  Swim to the end of this new tube and just before you get
to the end you will see a bubble that looks quite far away, but it is closer
then you think.  You need to jump into this bubble, then turn around and sonar
the switch that is on the rock behind you, as this will turn off the first of
the three tubes that the Squid is holding onto.  After you have turned the
switch off, look around you and you will see another bubble, quite far away.
You need to jump over to that bubble.  From there you need to jump again into
the next one that is to your right.  The second bubble you jump into is where
you would have been if you had taken the right hand option back in that rock.

Keep following the path of bubbles until you come to two sets of 'bouncers',
which are the bubbles that bounce you off of them.  After you have passed both
sets (1 single, 1 double) you will notice that there is one more bouncer left to
pass, and the jump is a B-I-G one.  If you get the angle or distance slightly
off you will plummet to your death.  If you do then you will restart back at the
single bouncer slightly earlier in the chain of bubbles, so you don't have far
to go to get back there.  Once you DO make the jump you will see the second
switch embedded in the rock nearby.  Sonar it and the second bottom tube will
go, leaving our hapless Squid holding on for dear life by just one tube.  Time
to find that final tube methinks.  Near the bubble you are in you will see a
tube snaking past.

If you jump back into this it will take you back to your start position again.
Once you are back at your start point, facing the Squid you need to enter the
current tube one more time and just follow the tube until it spits you out into
a bubble right at the end.  This is the final switch, which will send fresh
calamari flying over several square miles of the ground below.  After completing
this final stage you will see a tube to the left of the switch.  Jump into it
and hold on for the ride of your life as this will take you right back to your
start position once again. Now that you have dealt with that Squid blocking your
path you need to turn the tubes back on, so look for that switch again and sonar
it.  The tubes will be back in place and you can continue on your journey.

Enter the left hand tube, then stay with those tubes on the left and you will
get a current pushing you towards another floating rock structure.  Once you
are inside it, head to the bottom and jump into the tube that is there.  You
will notice some very strong currents cutting across the tube that will shove
Ecco outside the tube if you try to swim through them.  You will need to
perform a long jump over both currents in order to continue on your quest.
Once over the currents continue to the end of the tube and jump down into the
pool below you when you get to the end of the tube.  In the pool will be the
entry point for Abyss Of Inferno.

Ok, you've already defeated the weakest of the three bosses, now it's time for
Ice & Fire's bigger brother.  You should see a very large floating rock, which
if you head butt will break open to reveal some bombs.  What you need to do is
get behind one of the bombs so that you can see the clan dolphin and charge
the bomb.  This will send the bomb flying over to the dolphin and score one
hit.  The dolphin will also be trying to do the same to you, so the faster you
can move into position, the better.  After several hits a cut scene will take
over to show the destruction of the boss and Ecco will leap back into the pool
below, which will be the start position for Hanging Waters III

             Find & speak to the bird; get to the third Clan ruler
================================================================================

Your start position is the same as your finish position from Hanging Waters
II, so you should know where you are.  If you look around you will see a hole
in the wall for you to travel down which will lead you into another, taller
pool.  Head to the waters surface and look around and you should see a
waterfall.  Head down into the waterfall and once you are in the bottom pool
enter the bubble that is sitting in the middle of the pool.  From there, jump
into the tube and swim to the end and jump into another bubble.  Once you are
in this second bubble the next portion of your journey is below you.  You will
see more bubbles, and one of them should look closer then the others.  Jump
into it and then jump again into the next bubble in the chain that is slightly
lower then the one you are in now.

If you look around and below you will see more bubbles that you need to jump
into to get to the next stage.  The final bubble will have two tubes leading off
from it, of which you will need to take the top tube, which will lead you into
another floating rock.  Once inside, look for a tube with a yellow collar and
jump into it.  This will carry you to a fork in the tube.  You need to go into
the top tube first and jump into the bubble at the end to trigger off the water
trumpet, which will create a tube for you in a different part of the level that
you will need soon.  Head back the way you came until you get back to the fork
and now take the bottom tube and use the bouncers to follow the path from bubble
to bubble.

Once you are in the bubble with two tubes leading from it, you will need to take
the top tube and when you get to the end you will need to jump across to the
bubble on the right hand side of the tube.  In the second bubble will be a water
trumpet, which you will need to sonar, and then jump down into the bubble below
you and into the tube you just created which will link up with another bubble.
From there jump across using the two sets of bouncers and aim to get yourself
into the tube that passes in front of the final bubble.  Swim down and jump into
the floating rock.  Once inside you need to find the hole that has a giant bird
sitting on a rock.  Sing to the bird and he will fly off, but you will find him
again soon enough.

Head back into the tube you used to enter the rock and swim to the end.  On the
left will be a bubble with another water trumpet inside it.  Sonar this to
create a tube for you to jump into then swim through this into another tube
which will lead you back to the bubble where you started this little section
from.  Go into the bottom of the two tubes and swim to the end and you will find
the bird perched on the tube collar. Sing to the bird and a cut scene will take
over as it shows the bird picking Ecco up and carrying him up to the final Clan
ruler, and the entrance to Mutaclone.

================================================================================

You've managed to get past two of the rulers of the Clan.  Now you much do
battle with the strongest of all the Clan.  The dolphin will be enclosed in a
shield that you cannot break, so don't even try.  The key to beating this boss
is weakening the shield he is inside of.  On the floor of the level are a
series of rocks with semi-transparent yellow lights on them.  You must break
every rock that has this yellow light on them.  Each rock will require two
hits, and after breaking each rock your controls will be reversed for a short
time, so up = down, left = right, etc...  Also, while you are trying to break
these rocks the Mutaclone will be shooting at you, so you cannot just sit
still waiting for the effects of the rock to wear off.

Once you have broken all the rocks, the shield will drop.  Things just get from
bad to worse in this level, as now you have THREE dolphins to deal with.
Fortunately two of them are clones and will disappear if you charge them. Once
you have got rid of the two false dolphins, the real one will start chasing
after you.  To defeat the dolphin you have to get him to follow you through the
biggest rock with a yellow light inside it, as this will confuse the dolphin and
allow you to hit him.  After several hits a cut scene will take over showing the
destruction of the boss, but just before the boss blows up you will also find
the fourth Dolphin Trait that The Foe stole from the dolphins at the start of
the game.  This will open up the time vortex again and Ecco will leave this
timeline and head into another reality.

The reality that Ecco now finds himself in is a portrayal of the future if
Dolphin & Man were not ready for the arrival of The Foe.  Without the Guardian
to protect the Earth, there would be no force powerful enough to stop The Foe
from taking control of the Earth and claiming it as their own.  The fate of the
 future of Earth rests with you, Ecco, and these final five levels.

***NOTE FOR DREAMCAST OWNERS***
The Foe Sharks that appear within the first four of these five levels CANNOT be
killed.  They can be destroyed but they will re-spawn after a pre determined
amount of time.  This makes levels like Hatchery and Transfiguration much harder
then their PS2 equivalents.

By returning compassion and wisdom, Ecco changed history once again, but without
the final trait of humility, dolphins and humans were incomplete.  Heedless of
the danger, they were unready for the Foe and destined for defeat. Without the
final globe earth would become the Foe's domain.

                       4.02          CHANCE OF RECKONING
                      ===================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                   Block the whirlpools, blind the Foe Queen
================================================================================

When you start the level you will be at the start of a tunnel with a waterfall
behind you.  Continue forward past the first Glyph and collect the Endurance
Glyph to boost your health bar.  Continue forward until the tunnel opens out
into the main area.  Follow the wall round to the left and you will find a
Stealth Glyph near the snake.  Remember where this is and train yourself in
getting it quickly to avoid that snake shooting you.  After you are invisible,
head over to the nearest whirlpool and line yourself up so that you have a
straight line-of-sight between you, the rock ball in front of you and the
whirlpool.  Charge the rock to shove it into the whirlpool to block it.  You
will hear the Foe Queen scream out about you doing this but don't worry...YET!!!

Go back and renew the stealth power and move onto the second whirlpool.  Use
the same tactic as before to block it with the rock nearby.  Once you have
blocked these two, go back and get your Endurance Glyph if you need it, then
go and restock your stealth power.  Once you have renewed the stealth, head
past the second whirlpool (or to be more correct, the rocks where the whirlpool
used to be) towards the green vertical plates of coral that are in a small group
by the sidewall.  Once you pass this small group you will see 2 more plates of
coral slightly apart from the rest.  If you look to your left once you get there
you will see a small arch with a Foe Bat hanging from the roof of it, and a
Power Sonar Glyph in the arch.

Collect the Power Sonar and swim to the sharp right to put yourself on course to
deal with the third whirlpool.  The usual gap for the rock is blocked, but that
is easily solver with one blast of the Power Sonar.  While you are there you can
kill the Foe Shark as well, as he doesn't re-spawn like on the Dreamcast version
unless you die. Now line yourself up so that you can push this final rock into
the third whirlpool.  Once all three have been blocked the water level will
rise, exposing the Foe Queen's eyes to possible attack.  Before we try taking on
the Foe Queen lets hightail it out of this main area back to the safety of out
start position.  This next sequence of actions needs to be done in one smooth,
fast move.

Collect the Endurance, Stealth & Power Sonar then you need to sonar the Foe
Queen's eye with the Power Sonar as it has a shield over it.  You will know if
you do it because the Foe Queen will howl.  After you have dropped the shield
you need to charge the eye that you have just exposed.  A small scene will show
a rock starting to shake lose if you have done it correctly.  Head back to your
start point and repeat the above process for the second eye.  Once both eyes
have been knocked out you will need to deal with the final 'eye' on the back of
her head.  To defeat this one you will need that stealth Glyph again, and then
keep swimming round with the Foe Queen on your right as it is a quicker route to
the Vigour Glyph.

Once you have collected both Glyphs you need to move round to the back of the
head and charge the last 'eye'.  Be warned, the Foe Queen keeps moving her head
so you will need to hit it 'on-the-run' instead of lining the shot up nice and
carefully.  After this final eye has been knocked out the Foe Queen will be
unable to attack you except for her tongue, so stay away from the mouth (if you
haven't already found that out).  You will also see a final cut scene showing
the loose rock fall down onto the floor and open up the exit point to Hatchery.

                            ========================
                             4.03          HATCHERY
                            ========================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                          Destroy the Hatchery Keeper
================================================================================

When you start the level you will be in the incubation area.  In the middle of
the level will be a large, motorised brain with a long arm and a claw on the
end.  A shield that you cannot penetrate will also protect it.  You will
notice the brain move between three specific areas of the level. It will
collect an egg from the conveyer belts and place it into the incubation area,
it will collect a fish from behind a force field, which it will lower briefly,
and lastly it will remove empty or rotten eggs and place them into a rubbish
chute in the floor.  If you wait just out of reach of the claw until it picks up
an empty egg and moves towards the rubbish chute.  Follow the egg down the
rubbish chute to find the Power Sonar, which you will need to destroy the Foe
Shark in the main area.

Once you have the sonar, swim back up the tube and Power Sonar the rubbish chute
lid right in the middle and it will open, allowing you to escape.  Swim over to
the conveyer belts that the keeper gets the eggs from and you will see the Foe
Shark that needs removing before you continue, as it will make life easier if
the shark is gone.  Once you have removed the shark by using the Power Sonar,
locate the two switches on both of the sidewalls of this area.  If you are
facing the keeper then the left switch controls the door of the rubbish chute
and the right switch controls the force field of the fish tank.  The key to
completing this level is to interrupt the operation of the keeper by using the
two switches on the walls.

If you see the keeper putting an egg into the rubbish chute then sonar the door
switch to close the door on the claw.  This will confuse the keeper and drop the
shield surrounding the brain of the keeper, allowing you to swim up to it
QUICKLY and charge it.  If you see the keeper about to pick up a fish to feed
the Foe Young, then sonar the switch on the other wall to put the force field
back and confuse the keeper once again.  Repeat this procedure three times to
destroy the keeper.  Bear in mind that while you are doing all of this you will
still need to use those same switches to enter the rubbish chute to get food and
enter the fish tank to get air.  Once you have destroyed the keeper then swim to
the tube that the eggs were coming out of and enter it to move onto Seeds Of
Poison.

                         4.04          SEEDS OF POISON
                        ===============================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
              Locate & free one of the Foe Young to exit the level
================================================================================

You will enter this level from the green rock in the middle of the level.  You
can swim back into here to regain your air.  In one of the alcoves is a Power
Sonar Glyph, which you need to collect, then hightail it (pardon the pun) up
the tube in the middle of the ceiling.  Avoid the falling eggs that are
surrounded by shields and continue upwards until you cannot go any further.
These membranes are holding eggs that are waiting to be dropped down, but you
need to Power Sonar these to destroy them to allow you to progress further up
the Foe Queen's body (what a lovely thought!).  Whenever you break open an egg
you must head back to the bottom of the level to avoid being attacked by the Foe
Young.

Keep repeating this cycle until you have broken the final egg and are right at
the top of the level.  You will know when you are as the only thing above you
will be a tube that the eggs are coming from.  Go and collect the Power Sonar
again and QUICKLY swim back to this point and wait.  After a few seconds
(hopefully) an egg will drop down into the tube, waiting to be dropped
downwards.  Power Sonar this egg and the blue Foe Young that is released will
swim over to the sidewall and rip a hole in it, allowing Ecco to escape.  This
final part is all done as a cut scene, so you will not have any control of Ecco
until you reach Transfiguration.

                         4.05          TRANSFIGURATION
                        ===============================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
             Locate & metamorphoses into the fish to exit the level
================================================================================

This level will test the patience and composure of a saint, so don't feel that
you are alone in getting R-E-A-L-L-Y ticked off with this level, almost every
Ecco DOTF player has cursed more times at this level then any other.  First
things first, lets find a source of air and food.  From your start position
you should see an Info Glyph.  If you swim upwards and past it you will see a
small cave right at the top of the level.  This is your haven from the Foe
creatures in this level.  Once you feel ready to take on the level proper,
head down into the level towards the Info Glyph.  If you travel past the Glyph,
with the Glyph on your left flipper and keep heading down you should see a Foe
Snake on a green piece of ground, so swim past the Foe Snake and into the tunnel
beyond it.

There will be some Foe Bats in the ceiling of this tunnel, hiding in the reeds
hanging from the roof, which makes them very hard to spot.  Swim to the end of
the tunnel as close to the floor as you can to try to avoid them.  If you find
yourself being pulled upwards towards them then charge and swim as fast as you
can in order to escape.  If you're lucky you should avoid being caught.  At the
end of the tunnel will be a Power Sonar which you will need in order to kill the
Foe Bats in this tunnel, so collect it then make your way back down the tunnel
SLOWLY.  Whenever you see a Foe Bat you will need to Power Sonar them three
times in order to kill them and make them fall from the ceiling.  Once you have
removed all three Foe Bats, swim back to the Power Sonar and collect it once
again.

Now hightail it out of the tunnel as you will need your Power Sonar to reveal
another Power Sonar which will be of more use to you.  As you exit the tunnel,
head to the right and down until you see another green floor section with
another Foe Snake on it.  Near the Foe Snake will be a large brown rock, which
if you Power Sonar it will reveal another Sonar Glyph.  Collect this Power
Sonar Glyph and go after the Foe Sharks and kill them using the Power Sonar,
as it will make the final portion of the level much easier if you remove as
many enemies as possible now.  Don't forget to keep recharging those energy and
air bars as well.  Once you have removed both Foe Sharks and that weird Foe
'Rhino' Shark, then you can focus on the main portion of the level.

Go and collect the Sonar Glyph again and head straight up until you see that
Info Glyph again. Nearby you should see a small outcropping of rock that has
formed a small cave.  In the roof of this cave is another Foe Bat, so deal with
him as quick as possible then enter the cave and sonar the rocks on the floor.
If you run out of Power Sonar then head back to that rock on the floor of the
level.  Inside one of the stones will be a Metamorphosis rock.  Don't collect it
just yet as you need to do a couple more things first.  As you've probably
figured out by now there are three Foe Snakes, all at different heights to try
to keep you off track.  If you swim back to the lowest Snake and collect the
Power Sonar and stun the snake next to the rock, then swim to the snake by the
tunnel and stun him as well before moving onto the third snake, which is by that
rock cave, and stun him as well.

After this you can go into that rock cave and collect the Metamorphosis rock,
then head back to the bottom Snake.  Swimming near the bottom of the Foe Queen's
body is a small blue fish of the same species that you transmuted into all the
way back at Roaring Forces.  Seeing as you now have Ecco covered in stardust, it
is a simple matter of brushing yourself against the fish to morph into it again.
Once the transmutation is complete you will need to swim up the Foe Queen's body
towards the top of the level.  If you were paying attention to the opening movie
of the level you would have seen a flashing area on the Foe Queen, right near
the top of the level on the same side of the body as the nice hole that was
chewed into her from the Seeds Of Poison.  This flashing area is your exit
point.  You will need to guide the transformed Ecco up to this point and touch
the Foe Queen to exit the level into Heart Of The Foe.

[N.B.]
Be warned, if the weapons of the Foe Snakes hit you or you are attacked by the
Foe Sharks then you will transform back into Ecco and you will have to repeat
the whole process again.

                         4.06          HEART OF THE FOE
                        ================================

                               PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
                         Destroy the Foe Queen's heart
================================================================================

Ok, here we are, the final level of the game.  After the almost impossible
Transfiguration (mainly because of the constant attacks from the Foe Snakes)
the final level is remarkably easy, and doesn't really feel like it deserves
to be the final level.  This level has only one objective and that is to destroy
the heart of the Foe Queen.  Spaced around the heart chamber will be three
spouts that are spitting out small green antibodies.  At the bottom of the
chamber will be a poisonous liquid that starts to rise as soon as the level
starts.  The quickest way to complete this final level is to position Ecco
underneath one of the spouts and wait for it to spit out some antibodies.  The
spouts have force fields around them that you can only see if you hit them, so
don't get too close.

Once they start floating down towards you, you need to sonar them towards the
Foe's heart.  Each time an antibody hits the heart it will stun it for a few
seconds.  This is your chance to charge into the heart and give it a full force
hit.  After each hit the heart will beat slightly faster then before.  You have
to get back into position and stun and charge the heart NINE TIMES in total.
After the ninth hit, sonar another of the antibodies into the heart to finally
destroy the heart.  There will be a cut scene, which will show the heart
exploding.  Ecco will then swim up the centre of the chest cavity and out
through the mouth of The Foe, collecting the fifth and final Dolphin Trait from
between the Foe's teeth on the way out.

Now you can sit back and enjoy the ending sequence that shows that Ecco's
reality has been restored, Man & Dolphin are once again living in harmony and
The Foe has again been defeated.  Will they ever return for another attempt in
500 years time?

================================================================================

With all of their gifts restored, Ecco had made dolphins complete again.
Humility opened their eyes.  Wisdom brought justice and peace.  Intelligence
built them the Guardian.  Compassion erased all their hostilities.  Ambition
fulfilled all their dreams, and as the past was set right Ecco's reality was
restored.  His quest became one of the legends.  His name was sung throughout
time, and thus he became the immortal....Ecco the dolphin, defender of the
future!

                              6.00          EXTRAS
                             ======================
================================================================================

Ecco The Dolphin: Defender Of The Future has a couple of additional features
apart from the two bonus levels mentioned much further up in this
FAQ/Walkthrough.  There is the chance to enter the "Dolphin Soccer
Championship", as well as "The Gallery".  Details of how to access both items
are below.


================================================================================
                         ==============================
                          6.01          DOLPHIN SOCCER
                         ==============================
================================================================================

To gain access to the Dolphin Soccer game you need to be in the Powers Of
Levitation level.  When you go into the room with the Black Clan Dolphin who
goes off on an inspection, there is a hidden chamber, which contains a Stealth
Glyph, a Vitalit (already mentioned further up in this walkthrough) and a
Soccer ball.  The chamber is behind the first portion of wall to the right of
the door AS YOU ENTER THE ROOM.  If you swim into the Soccer ball you will
collect it in the same way as you would collect a Vitalit.  When you feel like
a game of 1-0-1 with a Clan Dolphin, exit the game and go to the level select.
At the bottom of the level select is the new option of "Dolphin Soccer"


================================================================================
                          ===========================
                           6.02          THE GALLERY
                          ===========================
================================================================================

                                ================
                                 GENERAL THINGS
                                ================

You get to the gallery from the Main menu simply by choosing it from the options
menu. A loading screen will appear then and after a while you find yourself
inside the gallery.  The gallery changes the further you get into the game. That
keeps it always interesting and makes it a great feature of the game.


                                ===============
                                 THE MAIN ROOM
                                ===============

The Gallery itself is a temple consisting of 8 rooms connected by one circular
chamber. Above each entrance you will find a significant symbol to help you
guide through the rooms.

Here's a guide to each symbol:
A seahorse------->>>>>> The entrance to the "Isle of Tranquillity" Image Gallery
A lyre----------->>>>>> The entrance to the  Soundtrack Archive
A gearwheel------>>>>>> The entrance to the "Man's Nightmare" Image Gallery
A film projector->>>>>> The entrance to the  Film Gallery
Two bubbles------>>>>>> The entrance to the "Dolphin's Nightmare" Image Gallery
Two heads-------->>>>>> The entrance to the  Credits Room
An alien head---->>>>>> The entrance to the "Domain of the Foe" Image Gallery
An arrow--------->>>>>> The entrance to the  Main Menu

The gallery changes each time you've played further in the game. Image
galleries will only open once you reach the first level for each 'world',
otherwise a gate will lock the room. It is similar with the Film Gallery.
Films are only unlocked once they have been viewed in the game. Only the
Soundtrack Archive and the Credits Room can be entered and fully used at any
time.  The image galleries contain between 5 and 9 conceptual art pieces,
which are attached to the walls.  You will uncover the artwork for any given
level when you collect ALL the Vitalits for that level.  By singing at the
artwork you can zoom in to get a better look at them.


                           ==========================
                            ISLE OF TRANQUILITY ROOM
                           ==========================

This room has a regal and 'expensive' feeling.  Luscious red walls with gold
accents that get picked out with the lighting in the room.  Lovely wooden
picture frames show you where the artwork will appear on the walls.  The
central statue will rotate from left to right if you sonar it.


                              ====================
                               SOUNDTRACK ARCHIVE
                              ====================

This giant room is absolutely great.  It has a water organ with long pipes
reaching from top to bottom of the room. The organ functions are simple. You
choose the world you want to hear music from by singing at the specific
symbol. Those are the same ones as used in the main room of the gallery. You
can also listen to the Film soundtracks, but those contain narratives. After
you've chosen the world, you can use the keys to listen to the songs simply by
singing at them. The music will still be played throughout the gallery after
you've exited this room.


                             ======================
                              MAN'S NIGHTMARE ROOM
                             ======================

This room is based on man-made machinery, and has a very heavy industrial
feeling to it.  Rather then have picture frames to highlight the artwork this
time, now there are a series of warehouse style strip lights bolted to the
wall above where each piece will be.  There are two wheels in the room, one on
your left just after you enter the room and a second on the back wall of the
room.  If you sonar them so that they are both moving at the same time, they
will trigger off a series of locks that reveals a lower section of the
Gallery.  The central item in the room will rotate after you have triggered
off the sequence, and then it will be pushed up which will leave a gap big
enough for Ecco to swim into.  This will lead you down to a tunnel entrance,
which brings you out underneath the floor of The Foe's Domain room.  Nothing
else going on though.


                                 ==============
                                  FILM GALLERY
                                 ==============

The Film Gallery does look like a fully working cinema, with the front of the
room having a canvas with curtains. The back of the room has a semicircle
shaped stairs, like a theatre. There are lights at the walls above those.
Only movies that you have seen during game play can be viewed.  Any movie that
you have not yet seen will be a grey outline picture.  To view any coloured
movie image, just sonar it.


                           ==========================
                            DOLPHIN'S NIGHTMARE ROOM
                           ==========================

This whole room is a direct clone of the levels from the Dolphin's Nightmare
section.  Large, semi-transparent items litter the floor, and the whole room
has a feeling of being 'alive'.  This is the only 'world' room without some
sort of secret passage, etc...


                                 ==============
                                  CREDITS ROOM
                                 ==============

This room has two of those golden dolphins we've seen before in the Isle Of
Tranquillity room, but these are positioned on either side of a black wall.
When you get near the wall the credits for the game will start to be formed
with the bubbles coming from the mouths of the statues.  You can watch the
whole thing if you like, or you can interact with it by swimming through the
credits themselves and making a mess of the whole show.


                            ========================
                             DOMAIN OF THE FOE ROOM
                            ========================

This room has that same sort of 'organic' feeling to it that is so visually
apparent in the Dolphin's Nightmare room, but not so obvious as the last room.
It is quite simply a round room with green/white squares on the wall where the
artwork will appear.  For those of us lucky enough to have played (and
completed) Defender Of The Future on the Dreamcast, we would have already seen
the artwork as background images during the credits at the end of the game.
If you go to the top of the room and sonar the ceiling, green 'dust' falls
from the top of the room.  It doesn't trigger off anything as far as I can
tell, although it is still nice to have another hidden feature to discover.


                                     ======
                                      EXIT
                                     ======

Quite simply, if you swim back into the doorway you entered from, you will go
back to the Main Menu / Title Screen.


================================================================================
                         ==============================
                          7.00          THE FINAL WORD
