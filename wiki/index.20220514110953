<p>Arkonviox is a fictional Atlantean Dolphin species whose burden is eternal life. The scene is apart of a fan driven game I hope to one day develop.</p>

<center>Welcome to the Arkonviox Network, a service dedicated to the Ecco the Dolphin fandom worldwide since November 2000.</center>
<br>
Since the game's 1992 release for the Sega Genesis (aka Sega Megadrive), Ecco the Dolphin has had a respectable cult following. The story centers on the eponymous character, whose destiny (or curse) is to save the planet from becoming absorbed by the cancerous reign of an alien race known as The Vortex. Thanks to a time machine left in the ruins of Atlantis, he has the ability to travel from epoch to epoch, finding clues and tools to aid him in his quest, as well as gaining the name "the stone that split the stream of time in two" from his oceanic friends. As this nickname suggests, time travel comes with many responsibilities and consequences -- much more than any creature is equipped to handle. Ecco causes rifts in the flow of time, alters both the past and the future, and eventually pays for abusing powers beyond his knowledge with his own existance, becoming damned to wander forever within the tides of time.

<p>Ecco's creator, Ed Annunziata, is the author of the original 16-bit classics. These games eventually spun off into a new series known as <i>Ecco, Defender of the Future</i>. The new 3D adventure took Annunziata's basic concept and found it re-imagined by David Brin, author of the praised <i>Uplift</i> novels, including <i>Startide Rising</i>. <i>Startide Rising</i> similarly features super-intelligent dolphins, though Brin's dolphins gained their abilities through human intervention.</p>
