What could be more awesome then Ecco fighting a polar bear!

The Ecco the Dolphin comic series consisted of two parts that featured in Sonic the Comic. Part One was shown in issues #13-18, released from November 13th 1993 until February 4th 1994. Part Two was shown in issues 60-65, released from September 15th 1995 until November 24th 1995. Egmont Fleetway published the comics, distributed throughout the United Kingdom.

<p>The story in the comics was based on the first Ecco the Dolphin game originally released for the Sega Genesis console. However, there are inconsistencies between the comics and the game which attempt to delve deeper into story elements and Ecco as a character. One notable change is a scene where Ecco fights a polar bear, which never happened in the Genesis game.</p>

I believe the point of the story changes were to take the same ideas and improve it; to give readers the same story without knowing what to expect. What's nice is one could read these comics and play the game without worrying about the plot being given away.

<p>The comics contain a unique art style that is very similar to Zdenek Burian's work. There's a lot of attention to design and color that make each page stand out like a masterpiece. The comics themselves must have taken a long time to produce, although the story is not the same as the original, it is definitely worth reading.</p>
