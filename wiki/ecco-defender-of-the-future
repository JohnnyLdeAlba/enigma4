At the dawn of the 30th century, after five hundred years of unity and fellowship, dolphin and man set out from the Earth to explore the great unknowns of space.

<p>But where man and dolphin founded a civilization of peace, others based theirs on strength, conquest, and domination.</p>

And, even as man and dolphin went out from the Earth, a sinister Foe cast envious eyes upon it.

<p>For the Earth was a prize beyond measure, a pristine world to be cherished or exploited.</p>

But the Earth was not defenseless. The mighty Guardian - the greatest creation of the dolphin kind - shielded it with its power.

<p>Undeterred, the Foe persisted, probing for a moment of weakness they were certain must come.</p>

It was in this time that a dolphin named Ecco arrived at the Isle of the Guardian, seeking to learn from the scholars of peace, but destined to be the only hope and champion of the Earth.

<center><b>Gameplay</b></center>
<br>
<i>Defender of the Future</i> was essentially the old Genesis/Mega Drive gameplay put into three dimensions.  It was released in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast, again developed by Novotrade; they had by then changed their name to Appaloosa Interactive.  Ecco's sonar was kept as a means of interaction with other cetaceans (no longer called Singers in the game) and certain environmental objects. A sonar map superimposed on the screen instead of switching to a different screen was also added. The same style of movement was kept with slight alterations for the demands of a 3-D game.  The control stick now only changed the direction Ecco was facing; pressing left and right changed the direction he faced horizontally, and pressing up and down changed the vertical direction.  To actually move foreword, the player had to tap a button to gain speed and hold the same button down to maintain it.  Out of the water, Ecco could perform the purely aesthetic flips in the air from the original games.  Charging foes was kept as Ecco's standard attack.  The health and air meters also returned, though the health meter could be increased by collecting power-ups called Vitalits, and the meters had a slightly different look compared to the Genesis games.
<br><br>
Some new moves were introduced in <i>Defender of the Future.</i>  One was a quick 180º turn, useful for battles.  Another was a means of stopping quickly; when Ecco had already stopped, the same buttons would make him swim backwards.  A third new move was the tailwalk; Ecco would raise his upper body out of the water and was able to look at things above the surface; this had limited use in gameplay but was a good way to see small graphical details abovewater.
<br><br>
The graphics are generally regarded as being some of the most realistic ever used in a Dreamcast game.  Many reviewers have commented that Ecco looks like a real dolphin.  One of the most major complaints against the graphics is the high level of fog; other reviewers have pointed out that visibility in the ocean is often much reduced from what it is above the surface.  There were also some pop-up problems with distant objects.  The few cutscenes used the in-game graphical engine.
<br><br>
<i>Defender of the Future</i> continued the legacy of high difficulty set by its predecessors.  The levels were again divided up, but the password system was dropped in favor of a memory card save file.  The game has few loading times in the levels; the levels were loaded all in one go just before they started, and these load times could be moderately long.
<br><br>
The "charge song" and "confusion song" returned in <i>Defender of the Future</i>, but in different forms.  The "charge song" was given a name, the Power of Sonar, and was part of a set of five temporary power-ups that could be activated by collecting icons.  The powers were:
<ul>
   <li>Power of Vigor (Ecco moved faster and did more damage when charging enemies)</li>
   <li>Power of Sonar (Sonar did damage to enemies)</li>
   <li>Power of Air (The air meter was temporarily doubled)</li>
   <li>Power of Endurance (The health meter was maxed out to double the normal maximum; it couldn't be replenished it reached the level the player had already obtained, and would be lost if the player made it to the next level of the game)</li>
   <li>Power of Stealth (Ecco became temporarily invisible)</li>
</ul>
The "confusion song" was named the Song of the Shark, and it too was part of a larger set of songs.  These songs were permanent and activated by singing at the right thing.  They were:
<ul>
  <li>Song of the Shark (confused sharks)</li>
  <li>Song of the Turtle (turtles would follow Ecco around)</li>
  <li>Song of the Fish (schools of fish would follow Ecco around)</li>
  <li>Song of the Ray (made manta rays go in the direction the song pointed; made smaller sting rays panic and flee)</li>
  <li>Song of the Plant (made a certain kind of plant spray ink)</li>
</ul>
<center><b>Full Storyline</b></center>
<br><br>
<i>Defender of the Future</i> bore a different storyline from that of the Mega Drive/Genesis games; it is generally regarded as an alternate universe.  The story was written by science fiction author David Brin, who had already written a few stories about intelligent dolphins.  The storyline and game were divided into four parts:
<br><br>
<center><b>Isle of Tranquility</b></center>
<br>
At the dawn of the 30th Century, dolphins and humans had been together in a cross-species society for 500 years.  Together, they had set out to explore space, offering peace and friendship to all who would welcome it.  But space had its dangers; a violent species known as the Foe decided Earth was a good planet to take over.  However, the dolphins and humans drove them to the brink of defeat, and so the Foe sought vengeance on Earth.  The few caretaker dolphins who had been left behind on Earth were not entirely defenseless; they were protected by a creation of theirs they called the Guardian.  It was a gigantic, sapient being made of a crystalline substance; it projected a force field over the entire planet.  Undeterred, the Foe began making suicide attacks on the field, searching for a weak point.
<br><br>
The player was given this background information before being thrown into the game.  Soon after the game started, the Foe found their weak point, destroying the field and breaking the Guardian.  "Isle of Tranquility" followed Ecco around until he managed to get to the dolphin city of Atlantis (apparently different from the Atlantis of legend) and repair the Guardian.  He accessed the city when no other dolphin could by temporarily becoming a fish using the Ancient Power of Metamorphosis (obviously an homage to the Metaspheres).  He was too late to stop the Foe invasion.
<br><br>
A Foe ship caused a rip in the time continuum and headed back in time in order to stop dolphins and humans from uniting into one society.  Ecco was caught in the wake of the time vortex, and ended up witnessing the Foe steal the Noble Dolphin Traits of Intelligence, Ambition, Compassion, Wisdom and Humility.  Ecco used the Ancient Power of Metamorphosis to become a flying Foe unit and destroy the ship; this scattered the globes containing the Noble Traits across history.  With the traits gone, however, the future was already changed.  Dolphins became weak and gullible; humans enslaved and exploited them.  When Ecco returned to 'his' present, 500 years after the Foe attack, humans had already gone extinct and dolphins were barely sapient animals.
<br><br>
<b><center>Man's Nightmare</b></center>
<br>
The "Man's Nightmare" levels were based around human technology, with heavily polluted water.  The dolphins Ecco met were divided into three sects: the Crimson, dolphins with red paint worn on their flippers; the Circle, white dolphins who showed an eagerness to operate machinery; and the Movers, orange and white dolphins with the build of orcas that had once apparently been the muscle of the dolphins when they had been enslaved.  The dolphins didn't know humans were extinct.  Some of them thought they had been left to test their loyalty, and spoke of a great Engine of Salvation that the Chosen One would activate with the Labor Harness.  After re-uniting the dolphin sects, Ecco managed to put on the Labor Harness, which allowed him to control human machines by singing at them, and headed off to activate the Engine of Salvation while looking for the globes that contained the Noble Traits.
<br><br>
After Ecco managed to find the Noble Trait of Intelligence and touch it, it was sent back in time and began affecting the Circle, Movers and Crimson.  They figured out the truth of man's extinction and his so-called Engine of Salvation; it was really a weapon that had been designed to fight the Foe, but man and the Foe had destroyed one another before the weapon had been completed.  The player's new task became stopping the weapon from activating; the reward was the Noble Trait of Ambition and progress into the next section of the game.
<br><br>
<b><center>Dolphin's Nightmare</b></center>
<br>
With Intelligence and Ambition both sent back, history changed.  Dolphins became aggressive creatures and forced humans from the seas, never to return.  They built their own independent society under the waves, and some above them; this level set featured the Hanging Waters as an homage to the Skyway from <i>Tides of Time</i>.  The dolphins seen in this section of the game were divided into two subtypes; the Clan dolphins were militaristic orange-and-white (lower ranking) or black-and-white (higher ranking) creatures who lorded over the green Outcasts.  Both subtypes looked down their beaks at whales; the Clan, for instance, used a pair of captured humpback whales as living power generators for their Hanging Waters.
<br><br>
The level set started by throwing Ecco into an Outcast village that had been cut off from their food supply by the Clan.  After getting fish back to them, one villager helped him reach the nearby Clan outpost.  There, Ecco found and rescued the leader of a secret resistance group that had formed in the Outcast village.  The Resistance, it turned out, had been keeping watch over the Noble Trait of Compassion, but were afraid to touch the globe.  The Clan had their own Trait which was later discovered to be Wisdom; they wanted the Resistance's globe for themselves.  Ecco sent Compassion back and infiltrated a large Clan base.  He tattooed himself with the rank of general and managed to get the Hanging Waters activated so he could fight the Clan's leaders, the three Exalted Ones.  The third Exalted One had the globe of Wisdom: Ecco sent it back, and history changed  once again.
<br><br>
<b><center>Domain of the Enemy</b></center>
<br>
With all but one of their traits restored, dolphins (evidently) united with humans.  However, without the final Trait of Humility, the society was heedless of the Foe's danger, and was defeated.  Earth was taken over, and the Foe Queen herself became the guardian of Humility.  There was not a lot of plot development in this final stretch; all that happened plot wise was that Ecco destroyed a Foe hatchery and slew the Foe Queen to gain back Humility and restore his own future, where the Gurdian created a statue of him and he was hailed as the great Defender of the Future.
