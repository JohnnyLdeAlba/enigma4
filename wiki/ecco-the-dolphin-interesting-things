<b>Teleport Rings in the City of Forever.</b>

One of the two teleport rings hidden in the City of Forever.
</div>

<br />
In the City of Forever there are two secret locations where there are teleport rings. Both locations require finding a glyph to open a secret passage and locating the passage where the rings reside.

<p>The first location is near the beginning of the level, to the far right and above. You will find a statue of a man that's actually a glyph to open the passage. If your in the far right corner at the beginning of the level go down and you should be able to pass through the wall where the first teleport ring is. This ring will take you directly to the time machine.</p>

The second glyph is half submerged and the passage to the teleport ring can be located with your sonar map. If your lucky enough to locate it the teleport ring will take you some what near the time machine.

<b>A Modern Day Jellyfish in Trilobite Circle.</b>

To the left is a jellyfish ancestor but to the right is a modern day jellyfish.
</div>

<br />
When the Asterite sends Ecco back 55 million years we traveled with Ecco into a world of unusual creatures. Nothing in this prehistoric environment is the same as it is in the modern world. That's why this interesting thing is hard to capture, you might just pass it by and not think twice.

<p>After traveling through several levels to reach this world and trying to survive its harsh environment, you won't notice one little modern day jellyfish isolated in this desolate world. The only time you will see it is in Trilobite Circle but the rest of the ancient world never more.

<b>Ecco the Dolphin Japanese.</b>

The beginning sequence has signs for which direction a new game leads to or where to go to enter the password.
</div>

<br />
The Japanese version of Ecco the Dolphin has a few notable differences from its American counterpart that distinguishes it in game play. One feature on the final level when the Vortex Queen eats you. Instead of having to start the level from the dreaded Machine you are taken to a new level called The Stomach.

<p>The Stomach is a lot like an easier version of the Machine except its not as big and easier to finish. The Stomach makes use of one of the several unused soundtracks from the level selection sound test. Within the level are vortex jellyfish that appeared in the the New Machine of Ecco 2: The Tides of Time. Once this level is completed the Vortex Queen regurgitates you out of her mouth, giving you another chance to fight.</p>

Other notable differences with the Japanese version of Ecco the Dolphin is how all text through out the game is presented in the Japanese alphabet. The selection scenario stage at the very beginning of the game has signs pointing in the direction of a new game or for entering a password.

<b>Medusa Bay Shortcut.</b>

<div id='caption'>

<br />
When initiating this shortcut you first must bring up the sonar map then once you exit and move, Ecco will magically swim off screen and to the next level.
</div>

<br />
There is an alternate way to exit Medusa Bay without having to get the key glyph to open the barrier glyph. It involves going through the first cavern and going as far left as possible until you reach a dead end with several fish. In this cave you want to get Ecco into the bottom left portion then press and hold the sonar button to bring up the sonar map. Now exit the sonar map and start swimming toward the upper right. You will notice Ecco magically swims off screen and onto the next level.

<p>My guess why it does this is its a bug in the game. Like a world map laid flat on paper this level works the same way and that the far left corner that triggers this bug is directly proportionate to the far right corner where the barrier glyph is. By examining a sonar map you'll notice I'm correct and the two locations horizontally meet. If you were to draw a line from the shortcut and the barrier glyph location it would be perfectly straight.</p>
