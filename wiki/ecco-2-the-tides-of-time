Ecco 2: The Tides of Time was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis and Megadrive. This game introduced two new tools for Ecco to use along his journey. He can travel great distances using teleport rings or morph into different creatures using the metaspheres.

<p>Ecco 2 takes off where the previous game left off with Ecco the Dolphin defeating the evil Vortex and saving his family. Unknown to Ecco the Vortex Queen followed the pod of dolphins as they escaped through the tube. Learning the source of Ecco's new power, the Vortex Queen arrives on Earth and tries to kill the Asterite.</p>

With the Asterite defeated Ecco looses his power as the Vortex Queen creates a new hive on Earth. It isn't until Trellia arrives, a dolphin from the future who shows Ecco that his existence has created a juncture in time.

<p>Two futures exist with a dark future dominated by the Vortex. Trellia takes Ecco to a good future where the Vortex were defeated. There Ecco finds the Asterite who tells him that he must return to his time and gather all the globes needed to restore its life.</p>

The Asterite sends Ecco back to his own time where he learns two of the globes where taken by Vortex from the dark future. He is unable to gather the final pair until Vortex from the dark future capture him and bring him to their time.

<p>Navigating through machines that control gravity, Ecco finds the globe holder and defeats it, bringing what he needs to restore the Asterite of his own time. With the Asterite restored, Ecco regains his powers and defeats the Vortex Queen and saves Earth once again.</p>

Because Ecco was the stone that split the stream of time in two, the Asterite sends him to destroy the Atlantean time machine. But instead of destroying it, Ecco uses it and disappears into the tides of time forever.
