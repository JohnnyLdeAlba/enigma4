<br />I guess you could call most of the Clan of Effigy Light kinda arrogant. I mean, the entire clan is known throughout the sea as the Defender’s revered ones and none of them, and I mean none of them have ever done anything to discourage the idea. Of course, when you’re known throughout the sea as "Ecco's Clan", well, you can act as arrogant as you like...

Ecco. "I come from the Dark Future. Strange creatures
brought me there. I am originally from the Flying

<br />Waves of the ocean gently rolled over one another as the sands at the bottom glowed ominously and faint. The moon hovered above the night sky and the water shifted from the sea breezes, while one figure stayed below. Ecco, the dolphin, was the figure.

<br />The blackened sky brought fear to all
who looked upon it. The moon, once a bright, brilliant
sphere, now stood motionless, covering the sky with
its dark, shadowy light. The waters of Earth reflected
the rays which never seemed to penetrate through the
motionless surface, that only moved slightly whenever
there was a dry breeze.

<br />Phosis reached the island, staying well away from it, circling it as if in some kind of orbit. "I curse your name, Otair..." He sung to himself, partially regretting even coming here. He would never see his pod again. He would probably die. All for what? To save a small, annoying, curious dolphin.

<br />Times had changed since the Big Blue left for northern oceans. These familiar seas would ring with the songs of his wisdom, no more. 
The Big Singer rocked in the cradle that was the sea, his immense weight completely void in the great expanse of blue. The Big Singer was indeed a large whale, unlike his name inquired. The tiny "real singers" sang songs of this name for one reason.
