The Undercaves was the first Ecco the Dolphin fan website on the internet. 
</div>

<br />January 2000 to July 2001
<br />http://www.ecco-the-dolphin.org.nz/

<p>The Undercaves was the <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website that started it all. It began in January 2000 and was created by Jason Grindlay, who was known in the community as blackfin. This website was the first to feature both information about the games as well as an interactive community of users. </p>

<i>"The idea for The Undercaves began to form about a year ago, at that time I had just finally finished playing Ecco 2: The Tides of Time for the umpteenth time, since SEGA at that time didn't seem to be inclined to continue the series and I wanted more, I started searching for Ecco websites on the net but quickly found that... there weren't any! I was also hooked on Sonic the Hedgehog at that time, I remember spending many hours browsing the many Sonic websites. I wanted the sort of the experience I had got on the Sonic websites but in terms of Ecco, but I couldn't because I couldn't find any other fans.</i>

<p><i>At that time I had been teaching myself HTML for the last year or so but I hadn't found anything to make a website about yet, needless to say the solution to both my problems was obvious, I would make an Ecco website!" – Jason Grindlay</i></p>

The site featured a modified version of Ultimate Bulletin Board that allowed users to post questions and information to share with others. There was also a java applet that linked users to an IRC chat room that allowed them interact with one another.

<p>The best part of the site was the fan stuff section where users could submit artwork, stories and games based on <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i>. There was a word search that if solved would give the URL to the secret page.</p>

Arkonviox.com spawned from The Undercaves and became its biggest competitor for a user base. The competition became known as the infamous website wars of who could grow the biggest site and find the most interesting content. The Undercaves eventually ran dry of users as Arkonviox.com grew in popularity. Jason eventually threw in the towel and passed ownership over to Johnny de Alba, owner of Arkonviox.com. The site was officially closed August 2001 and its content was merged with the old Arkonviox.com.

Arkonviox.com had the best <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> fan artwork on the Internet. 
</div>

<br />November 2000 to August 2004
<br />http://www.arkonviox.com/</p>

Arkonviox.com started off as a Geocities free site called The City of Tantalus that featured concept art for the game <i>A Stone in Time</i>. It eventually grew into an </i>Ecco the Dolphin website</i> featuring fan artwork and fan stories in November 2000. 

<p>It became very popular with Undercave’s users who where able to request Arkonviox.com co-owner Mario de Alba to design forum avatars for them. The avatars were hosted on Arkonviox.com and a URL was given to the user who could use the image links on The Undercaves.</p>

The key to making Arkonviox.com popular was its devotion to fan-related material. It became very popular among <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> artists and spawned the most beautiful <i>Ecco</i> fanart ever seen.

<p>The blundercaves web comic was a big hit amongst Undercave’s users for its exaggerated comical depiction of The Undercaves community. It featured Undercaves owner blackfin as clumsy fool filled with empty threats.</p>

What made Arkonviox.com unique from other websites was enigma, a content manager that allowed the site to alter its appearance through the use of skins. The site had a total of eight skins, all based on level themes from the actual games.

<p>When Arkonviox.com owner Johnny de Alba acquired the Undercaves website, enigma was scrapped for a more traditional design. The site dropped what made it unique in order to merge content from the Undercaves. Postnuke eventually replaced enigma as a content manager, but it wasn’t the same. It gave the site a more generic look and made adding skins challenging.</p>

Arkonviox.com came to an end in November 2004 when its decline in updates lead to the decline of community activity. With Arkonviox.com gone the era of <i>Ecco</i> websites that strove to be better then one another came to an end.

<h1>Ecco the Dolphin: Caverns of Hope</h1>

<br />
Caverns of Hope is the oldest <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website still in existence.
</div>

<br />September 2001 to Current
<br />http://www.cavernsofhope.com/</p>

Caverns of Hope was created in September 2001 by Hauke and GTK. At the time The Undercaves had officially closed, making Arkonviox.com the only <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website on the Internet. Hauke was not satisfied with Arkonviox.com being the source of the Ecco Community. He and GTK were former Undercaves members and felt that they should start a new Ecco website. 

<p>Before The Undercaves closed, no one thought to challenge it by creating another <i>Ecco</i> website. The Undercaves was understood by everyone to be the best, a monument to our hero, Ecco. No other was needed until Arkonviox.com challenged this. With the Undercaves gone the unspoken rule no longer applied and a new website was opened: Caverns of Hope.</p>

Arkonviox.com would finally met its match, an <i>Ecco</i> website that would ignore history and its roots to create a new community. The site was created in secret, started out small and grew to become a big <i>Ecco</i> website. A website war developed between Arkonviox.com and Caverns of Hope over members but eventually an alliance was formed that would last until Arkonviox.com ended. 

<p>When Arkonviox.com closed, Caverns of Hope reached a new peak in popularity. The site grew in activity with members writing stories, doing artwork, even combining in a joint effort to create a fan game. The site grew out of control for the moderators, as it became the biggest thing to hit children since Mr. Rogers. The conflict of Caverns of Hope becoming a good website or a cesspool went unnoticed by its members but well noticed by its owners.</p>

Balance in the form of a cheap, well-known forum hack lead to the site's end. The forum's deletion crippled the site and the admins pulled the plug on all interactive parts leading to the death of the <i>Ecco</i> community. 

<p>Today Caverns of Hope is a resource site for <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i>. It has a guest book where users comment and occasionally ask questions about the site. If you're lucky, you may even get a response from one of the administrators.</p>

The Atlantis is a very successful Russian-language <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website.
</div>

<br />August 2006 - Current
<br />http://www.mod-atlantis.net/

<p>The Atlantis was created in August 2006 by Moduvator, who was a former member of Caverns of Hope and Arkonviox.com. Arkonviox.com at the time was a no-rules tyranny where any forum member could be banned for whatever reason. Unhappy with his treatment on Arkonviox.com, Moduvator joined Caverns of Hope's forum for a more pleasant atmosphere.</p>

Moduvator eventually gained the administrators' respect, becoming a moderator of the site's forum. Because of his experience with Arkonviox.com, Moduvator's goal was to create a censored forum everyone could enjoy. He had a vision of what Caverns of Hope's community could be that didn't agree with the site's owners.

<p><i>Despite the difficulties I've had with him I still want to mention him for helping out by watching the forum in a time of crisis where we were under quite some attacks. - Hauke</i></p>

Moduvator eventually quit his membership with Caverns of Hope and formed a new website called The Atlantis. Because of the Russian pronunciation of words with a definitive title, it's called The Atlantis rather than Atlantis, signifying Moduvator's heritage. 

<p>The Atlantis began as an English language <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website but changed pace a few years later to become a Russian-only website. Today The Atlantis is a very successful <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website with a flourishing community.</p>

DARK SEA's goal is to be a resource for everything related to <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i>.
</div>

<br />November 2000 - Current
<br />http://ecco-darksea.com/

<p>It is hard to place a date when DARK SEA began since it derived from Histronic's ExtremeEcco, Ecco 2 Beta Website. It began as the first website to document the <i>Ecco 2 Beta</i>, mistakenly called a beta by the original dumpers. The website aimed to be an in-your-face documentation of the <i>Ecco 2 Beta</i>, inspired by the Undercaves and Arkonviox.com.</p>

Epicenter eventually took over operations and rebuilt the <i>Ecco 2</i> Beta website with a more detailed article that took documentation deeper. When Arkonviox.com closed and Caverns of Hope ceased operations, Epicenter's <i>Ecco 2 Beta</i> website became DARK SEA. The goal of DARK SEA became to document everything related to <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i>. Although it does not as a general rule contain <i>Ecco: Defender of the Future</i> content, it does have music by Tim Follin from <i>Defender</i>.

<p>DARK SEA is the only <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website to have ever contacted most of the original developers for <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i>. It is also the only <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website to host many prototype versions of <i>Ecco 2: The Tides of Time</i>. Much of the old content from Arkonviox.com has been merged into DARK SEA, but because of how large the site is, Arkonviox.com only makes up a mere fraction of the content.</p>

<span id='tab'>R.I.P.</span>

<div id='panel'>
Isles of Tranquility - A fan website created by Orion and Flippy to take on the community of Caverns of Hope when the site's forum closed. Flippy was developing an <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> fan game that was 3D. Because of Orion's lack of interest and Flippy's lack of time the site closed not too long after it opened.

<p>Eccocide - This website opened a little after the Undercaves opened and was an attempt at another <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> fan website. It was inspired by the Undercaves but never managed to make it past a one-page site. It is only mentioned here because it was the first attempt after the Undercaves to create an <i>Ecco</i> website, since back then no one else bothered to challenge the Undercaves' dominance.</p>

<a href='http://ecco-le-dauphin.ifrance.com/' target='_blank'>Ecco le Dolphin</a> - This is the weirdest of <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> websites because it's hard to say if it's dead or alive! The site is updated once every few years with a new look and has a little bit of content. It is a very old French <i>Ecco the Dolphin</i> website.

<p>EccoWorld - This was an MSN Communities website that inspired Arkonviox.com the most because of it revealed web design's ease of creation. Had this site not existed, Arkonviox.com would have never happened, and all because of this one-page <i>Ecco</i> website created by Ecco the Barbarian, Internet hero of the time.</p>
