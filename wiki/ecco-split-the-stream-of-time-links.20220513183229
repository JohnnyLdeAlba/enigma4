<br />This site looks promising but is still under construction. Looks alot like the old Arkonviox.com's Defender of the Future theme which means when this site is done it will be awesome.

<br />Clair Turner's Deviantart gallery with a combination of different artwork. Not only is she a talented musician, shes a talented artist too. If you just became an artist today don't get too intimidated when you open this link.

<br />This girls artwork is intimidating! she's so good if I was planning on becoming an artist it make me take my pencil and break it into so many small segments I could never use it again. Shes got a little bit of everything so it may take a while to look through all her artwork, just to warn you.
